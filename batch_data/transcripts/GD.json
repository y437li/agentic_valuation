My name is Adrienne, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Adrienne and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter conference call.  As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic:  Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks relatively brief today. I think the numbers are pretty straight forward and largely speak for themselves. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.71 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.3 billion, operating earnings of $871 million and net earnings of $595 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.07 and were ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also somewhat better than our previous guidance and ahead of our own expectations. I should point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $347.2 million for the quarter, $7.4 million shares below the fourth quarter of last year. I\u2019ll ask Jason Aiken to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I complete my remarks.  Free cash flow for operations was $341 million, approximately 57% of net income. This is typical to the first quarter. But I should add that we expected particularly robust second quarter from a free cash flow perspective driven in part by advance payments on international orders. In many respect the story for the quarter is about the order book, particularly in defense. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of $56 billion, up approximately $10 billion over the last quarter with particularly impressive growth in combat systems backlog. Marine systems backlog grew and IS&T had a modest gain after adjusting for some of the backlog in the UK that was transferred to combat systems.  Interestingly we have more funded backlog at the end of this quarter than we've had any time in the last three years, the same is true for total backlog. We also look forward to a strong second quarter intake, particularly marine system with the anticipated booking of the Block IV Virginia class multi-year contract, the underpinnings of our defense businesses are clearly solidifying.  Compared to the first quarter 2013 revenue was down less than expected $80 million or 1.1%. On the other hand operating earnings were up $24 million or 2.8%. Our operating cost and expenses were $104 million less than the year ago quarter leading to a 50 basis point improvement in margins at 11.9%, this is very strong operating leverage.  Net earnings were up even more than operating earnings, 4.2% versus 2.8% primarily due to lower tax rate. EPS was up 5.6% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.  Let me provide some commentary and a little bit of perspective around the results of our operating segments, first Aerospace. Sales are up over Q1, 2013 by $347 million, 19.5% and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $94 million about 30%. Compared to Q4, 2013 operating earnings are up $56 million or 16% principally due to mix shift and continuous improvement on 650 production and completion efficiency.  This resulted in 19% margin for the group. Again Jet Aviation's continuing profitability made a nice contribution. Orders were not strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2013 order book. We are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group  Marine systems, revenue was off 1.5%, $25 million compared to the year ago quarter. The sequential story is similar with respect to revenue. However, operating earnings were up $7 million 4.4% against the year ago and the same sequentially.  The real story in the quarter is a 10.4% margin rate which is really top notch and better than expected. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter. Backlog grew $837 million in the quarter with significantly more to come in the second quarter, as I mentioned a few minutes ago.  At Combat Systems, compared to the first quarter of 2013 sales were down $236 million or 15.2% and earnings were down $79 million or 36.7% on a margin of 10.3. It is important to note however that these results were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at ELF as a result of reduction in our Austrian operations which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland.  If we disregard that charge margins would be 12.5%. Despite the restructuring charge ELF is expected to have operating margins around 10% for the year. The big story here is the large international order that finally came through. Total backlog is up $10.2 billion over the year-end number. Each of the combat systems businesses filled backlog in the quarter. You should see steady revenue, earnings and margin rate performance improvement throughout the year in this group. IS&T, The revenue in this business group is holding up well in this difficult environment. You might recall that our guidance to you was to expect a revenue decline of 20% year-over-year but it didn't happen in first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up $166 million or 6.8% against a year ago quarter. It was off 15.2% sequentially. Operating earnings of $183 million in the quarter were only $2 million less than the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis operating earnings were $13 million lower or 66.6% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins, once again exhibiting nice operating leverage. Total backlog for the Group was down $43 million from year-end but that includes a $248 million transfer of backlog from our UK business to combat system. Absent that transfer IS&T backlog actually grew. So once again IS&T is off to a good start. And thinking about the rest of the year we are increasing our EPS guidance to $7.05 to $7.10 from our initial expectation of $6.80 to $6.85. The increase assumes currently anticipated operating performance and the share count reduction realized in the first quarter. Think about the quarterly performance is lower in the second, flat in the third quarter with a strong Q4 finish. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will take just a few minutes to review some financial items with you before we start the question-and-answer period. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $23 million in the first quarter of 2013. For 2014 we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million.  At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects the net cash position, that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $385 million, a decrease of $1 billion from the end of 2013. This decrease is due in large part to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address in just a minute. We don't have any scheduled debt repayment until January of next year when $500 million of fixed rate notes will mature.  Our effective tax rate of 30.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected, primarily as a result of the close out of the 2012 tax year. For the full year we still expect our effective tax rate to fall between 30.5% and 31%. We expect cash contribution to our pension plan 2014 to be around $550 million to fund our obligation. The bulk of funding is scheduled to occur in second half of the year, specifically during the third quarter. As an update to our capital deployment plan I would like to address our activities in the first quarter. As you will recall we entered into an accelerated share repurchase plan in late January to repurchase 11.4 million of our shares. This exhausted our remaining repurchase authorization and in early February our Board authorized repurchase of an additional 20 million shares. Since then we repurchased 3 million more shares during the quarter. In total we deployed approximately $1.7 billion on share repurchases and divided payments in the quarter. In March our Board declared a dividend increase of more than 10%, that's the 17th consecutive annual increase. Our intent in 2014 is to return essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter we have $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to execute our capital deployment strategy during the coming quarters and achieve the objective of [inaudible] 2014.  Erin, that concludes my remarks. I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan :  Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Adrienne, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi Group. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky - Citigroup:  Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Good morning. Just a quick question on Gulfstream. You mentioned the bookings there being down quarter-on-quarter after a really nice finish to last year. I am just wondering if you can remind us of the seasonality that we typically should expect with bookings at Gulfstream just to kind of help everybody get prepared for the rest of the year kind of based on what you see in your pipeline at this point. What do bookings look like on a quarter-to-quarter basis throughout the rest of the year? Phebe N. Novakovic: So the new aircraft sales opportunities continue to look very good and we got strong customer interest but we are still seeing extended negotiation periods in order to get that order closed and what that drives is some difficulty in being very specific and precise about the quarterly progression. So our orders have intended to be a little lumpier like in the first quarter building with a strong fourth quarter finish. That\u2019s the pattern that we have been looking at for a while and this year looks about the same with no material difference. But the order interest, the activity is very-very strong. It\u2019s just when we get to closure and that\u2019s what makes it difficult for us to be real clear and specific on quarter timing. Jason Gursky - Citigroup: And the mix that you are seeing at this point, is it still favoring the large cabins versus the mid cabins? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. We talk the last couple of call about understanding our mix and our order activity and when you have got a four year backlog on the 650s, you are not likely to see and in fact it's somewhat impossible to get a one-to-one book-to-bill. So what we follow very carefully is the order activity and sign-ups for large cabin, mature aircraft, 450 and 550 and 60% of the orders in the quarter were for those two models. So again, very, very strong for the 450 and 550. Jason Gursky - Citigroup: That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets : Phebe, I have just a follow-up on that. I was wondering if you could comment on the sort of pricing. You are saying in the new and used jet market and also if you have seen any impact from the recent activity over in Ukraine and Russia? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So, pricing is holding up nicely in the pre-owned market and looks to be stabilizing in the large cabin market, particularly on the 550. In the mid-cabin, we see a little bit more pricing pressure but that is nothing new. This is consistent with what we have seen in the past. And so far the activities in Ukraine and Russia have not affected our operations. Our Moscow operations are continuing and Gulfstream hasn't seen any material activity. Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada : Great, thanks so much. Operator :  The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank :  Thanks. Good morning, good quarter. Phebe, if I could go through one-by-one but may be the segments and your outlooks have been revised, much particularly on the margin if you want to extricate the kind of the margin guidance you are looking for as well as aero guidance for margins and maybe IS&T sales? Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes. So we didn't give specific update for the segment guidance and we are holding to it at the moment. We will update it in the second quarter when we've got more clarity about where exactly the puts and takes are across the business, but we are confident enough to increase our overall guidance. So we are very comfortable with that. With respect -- and I will just tell you, with respect to combat in particular we are still holding to our low to mid 14% range in aerospace we are still looking at the 17% margin range. So nothing has changed and we are very confident in both of those numbers. Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And the upper IS&T sales? Phebe N. Novakovic IS&T sales were stronger in first quarter then we had anticipated and we have good order activity. But again, IS&T sales are pretty lumpy, driven in large measure by our healthcare business, which is highly seasonal and we usually only get about a quarter advance notice when it comes to the customers interest and increasing the sales volume. Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank : Okay, good luck. Good quarter. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic:  Thanks. Operator :  Next question come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Phebe N. Novakovic:  Hi, Joe. Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan:  Thanks. Good morning Phebe. Just wanted to dig into the aerospace margin a little bit. I hear you on maintaining the guidance for now since it's early but you beat December by a couple of basis points, last year obviously Q1 was a very strong start. May be if you could give us a couple of reasons why we shouldn't get too far in front of you on aerospace margin side. Phebe N. Novakovic:  Let me talk a little bit about margins in quarter versus our budget and they are attributable to two primary factors, lower than anticipated pre-owned sales and better than expected G650 cost performance. So going forward we don't see that margin performance repeating for a whole host of reasons mix shift, supplier cost, timing of other expenses. So when we factor all of those into our thinking at the moment we don\u2019t see that kind of upside to margins over our guidance. Joseph Nadol - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein - Bank of America : Good morning, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic : Hi. Ron. Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Big picture question for you. If you stand back and observe the operating profit of the company in the quarter, nearly about 46% of it was from [inaudible]. So General Dynamics now looks like it\u2019s almost a half a commercial aerospace company and half a defense contractor. How do you think about that strategically about the positioning of the company? And when you think about deploying capital and that sort of mix? Phebe N. Novakovic: So we like our strategic positioning. I like that balance between aerospace and defense, and that our defense business is as I pointed out and we\u2019ve seen now quarter-over-quarter through the last year are holding up very, very nicely. With implicit growth in the marine group, which we don\u2019t talk of a whole lot about, it doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention but in addition to block IV we\u2019ve got considerable suitable revenue upside for the next several years as we move increasingly into a higher replacement and we gear up even more on the two year of Virginia class construction. So there is some upside in our first of our current sort of sales profile on the defense side driven primarily by marine group but not exclusively. So stabilized combat and IS&T is continuing to hold the trend.  So I like where we are with respect to our balance between our commercial aerospace and business jet market and defense. When you think about capital deployment I think clearly we need to -- we will and we do make investments where we believe we are likely to get a good return and you will see over the last, frankly almost decade now, we\u2019ve been heavily investing in Gulfstream and that investment is beginning to pay-off with very purposeful our capital deployment strategy at Gulfstream, because we believe and history has proven us correct that it was a business jet market and our place in that market was a good market to invest in.  So I think that the rectitude of that, the series of positions many years ago that we're continuing to follow makes it an awful lot of sense. So I think going forward you can expect the same kind of behavior for us so we see an opportunity to grow very accretively and profitably we will. Ronald Epstein- Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Thank you, good morning. I am interested in the Minsheng order which was just announced. And I think it\u2019s a very interesting situation but I am trying to understand the majority of the airplanes in your previous, the 2011 order those have still not been delivered. And I am curious what your expectations are regarding the timing of the deliveries in this very large order in the next several years. Phebe N. Novakovic:  So I think the underlying assumptions in your -- in the beginning of your questions on Minsheng we have delivered a number of those airplanes. Going forward we have conservatively booked that order, the order was for 60 aircraft and another 20 options and we were very conservative in our bookings of those firm orders. So as we go forward and we like -- that\u2019s a terrific business for us Minsheng is a close partner. We have a very good relationship with them and we see that as steady. It will come in episodic orders, speed orders but so far we like where we are. Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co: I am assuming that this is something. This is really a long term situation that\u2019s very tied to what happens in China in terms of demand, is that fair? Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes, it is fair. But we have a history with Minsheng that when they place an order they mean it. And when we declare it when we move it from estimated potential contract value in to firm orders we have got a lot of deposits and we have a slot and a delivery profile. So, so, that's again we are -- this isn't a big pop with no substance. When we announced these orders with Minsheng the full intension is to execute and with -- you know our commercial exposure right, it's going to be driven by macroeconomic factors but so far there's considerable demand for these airplanes in China. Doug Harned- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Peter Arment - Sterne Agee :  Yes, good morning and nice quarter Phebe. Phebe, can I just ask kind of a back to kind of Ron's question, more of a big picture now that the budgets out the green book out, could you maybe give us a little, how do you think GD is positioned domestically here both combat and marine on some of those core programs? You touched upon it on the Virginia-class and the Ohio class replacement but maybe just how you are thinking about given the DoD outlook. Phebe N. Novakovic: So a couple of things. Absent a significant change in the threat environment, or a return to the sort of self-destructive government behavior across the board spending type, we believe that we have crossed at least in our programs and I would point you to the strong backlog as a harbinger of our sales performance. The majority of our programs are programs of record and as we talked before they tend to fare better in a funding constrained environment. So combat, combat's going forward profile is, is heavily dependent and tied to international orders. We have seen those orders begin to come in. There are more out there in our pipeline, frankly fairly robust. The investments spending on both army and the marine core is at sustainment levels and we factored back into our plan and we are comfortable with that those programs that we have on our plan are executable and that the funding is available.  And to marine I touched on the two big drivers of Ohio replacement and the Virginia-class through the year. We also see continued interest in commercial containership and tanker market. So those again, those orders for the commercial during that ship building tend to be a little bit more of the products but we still have a healthy pipeline that we are continuing to explore with our customers. So if I step back in IS&T, IS&T has again largely we believe stabilized itself. It's a growth engine there being GVIT, not surprisingly. Our ISR business is stable with long standing programs of record. And our networking and communication business has downsized itself in response to the revenue decline and again has programs of record that they are continuing to execute on. So across the board I think that we are on the defense side very well positioned. Again I point you to our backlog. Peter Arment - Sterne Agee : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities :  Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi, Sam. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi. I wanted to see if you can talk a little bit more about combat systems and I am just trying to understand a couple of things. One is you know an order of magnitude in terms of the advances benefit you expect to get in Q2. And then trying to just think about how do you go from a 10% margin now to a 14% margin for the year. You mentioned the EOS restructuring charge even if you take that out, you still have to have some high teens type of margins and I am not sure what drives that. Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So let me talk a little bit more about the Q1 margins. I mentioned our $29 million charge. We also have some contract mix, changes across the group that will normalize as we go through the year quarter-over-quarter. And you will recall that we moved the specialty vehicle to UK Vehicle program out of the backlog in IS&T and in to combat and that is a conservatively booked program given the state that it was in at the beginning of 2013.  So those were some of the margin pressures we saw in the first quarter. With respect to going forward I think that this group has amply demonstrated their ability to reduce costs faster than revenues declined. So we've seen quite a bit of operating leverage from them. As you think about Combat Systems at the height of their revenue and in 2009 kind of crowding 10 billion we've seen a 40% decline in margins and yet last year we had -- in revenue last year we had 15% margins and this year we are looking at 14% and I don't see anything in our backlog or in our performance year-to-date that would suggest that we're going to have headwinds on margins. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And any sense in terms of the advanced benefit you mentioned in the second quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes so it's going to be in excess of $1 billion and but again much of that will be deployed quickly obviously to our subcontractors. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital : Good morning Phebe and Jason. Quick question Phebe about your comment on the 650. You noted you had better cost performance there in the quarter, I wondered if you might give us some color on whether that was recurring or non-recurring in nature. How should we think about the implications there for the learning curve relative to your prior comment? Phebe N. Novakovic: So we are continuing to come down that learning curve. And our 650 margin performance on both the green airplanes and outfitted the airplanes is improving quarter-over-quarter. So very nice operating performance on the 650, and we expect that to continue. Certainly we're going to -- the learning curve will flatten out as we go forward but so far we expect to see additional margin improvement on both green and outfitted airplane. Phebe N. Novakovic: But there wasn't anything in the quarter, specifically that the benefit is\u2026 Phebe N. Novakovic: These are repeatable. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital : Okay, thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic: Margins are repeatable. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Phebe, if we could just dig into IS&T a little bit more obviously you did outperform the expectations and the guidance here in the quarter. How much of that is -- it sounds like you think that's potentially sustainable or is it just the army pressure is somewhat delayed and may be not even fully a 2014 event and I guess I am speaking more to the C4 side. Phebe N. Novakovic: So C4 saw the largest decline in the quarter in-line with our plan and as you'll recall we talked quite a bit at the end of last year and beginning of this year about our attempt to de-risk our army exposures C4 has done that. So what we see right now going forward to C4 is they've got almost everything in all their revenue in their backlog.  So I think that they can see some stability from a revenue perspective based on our expectations going forward. And again their programs of records particularly when TR are really doing quite nicely. Each one of those businesses had a book-to-bill of 0.9 or greater. So that also tells me that there is support for our products. So they've got C4 so let's recall has exposure to the UK and Canada and fairly robust exposure in both markets. So that helped offset some of the uncertainty we've had in the past about army spending. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So the 33% reduction in sales you talked about in January, is that off the table or you're simply saying you are observing it well enough with strength elsewhere? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah, I thought I gave you around a 20% decline. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Well 20% overall for the unit, right? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah. It too soon for us to walk back from that decline. We had a good first quarter, a good book to bill but I don't want to get out ahead of that because as I mentioned earlier one of the big drivers is that the largest driver in IS&T revenue is going to be our healthcare business and that is very, very seasonal and we usually -- what our experience has been over the last year and half we only get a quarter worth of notice, the warning that we are going to have to up our activity. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Right. Well maybe another way to ask the same question is was the President\u2019s budget with the drawdown in army down to the mid-400,000 level, is that already contemplated in your guidance, does that match up with what you are planning for? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic: No surprises there and no reason to adjust. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Right, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company:  Yes, thanks so much, Phebe. So if we can maybe get a little more color to help us reconcile the downtick in margins at Gulfstream from 19% to like 17% plus, 17.6% for the year. I mean if in fact you are doing well on G650 with more learning curve improvement to come I would think that would be in margin plus as we move forward and you also have mentioned used biz jet sales being weak, I mean is there higher, I mean I assume they are not hugely -- the volume looked so good in that quarter. I still have a little trouble understanding how you know your guide for the year isn't quite a bit low. Phebe N. Novakovic: So the pre-armed and let me give you a little bit more color on this. The pre-armed sales activity was lower in the quarter that we had anticipated but we still expect to take pre-armed and remainder of the year that obviously has margin headwind. We also going to have some mix shift that we are anticipating. Timing and other expenses and we thought supplier cost that we are factoring into our thinking. So it is 650 performance continues to be good but as we go out to produce more mid cabins we are going to see those are lower margins particularly on both of those 280 and the 150 and that provides you know that causes some headwind in margin activity.  So it\u2019s really the big shift, supplier cost and timing that make us properly cautious about the margin expectations for the year. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company: Okay but it looks like you know your guide, as I take it of large cabin deliveries you did 25 and aren't we looking for something like 118 for the year and so well yes we do have an uptick coming in terms of the mid-size. You know you also have on the larger planes in the mid-size you know are considerably less revenue. So I guess I am still is it something at jet or services, you know that is changing the mix because I think you explained just on the surface the mix doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s that much worse. Phebe N. Novakovic: You know the 450 is a lower margin airplane than the 550, in fact 650 margins have now exceeded the 450 margins largely because of the supplier cost that we talked about before and those increases in supplier cost hit the 450 pretty robustly. So the service activity we anticipate continued a good strong level of service activity. It\u2019s very, very strong in the quarter and going forward jet continues to be profitable.  So I really go back to mix our shift on 450\u2019s and mid-cabins and higher pre-owned, our supplier cost and then the timing of some other expenses. So it really is premature from us to get out there and project -- I don\u2019t see at it at the moment, 19% or 18% margins doesn\u2019t mean we also\u2026. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company: So your information is basically that within the large cabin the mix is shifting pretty sharply toward the 450 which is the lower margin product? Phebe N. Novakovic: That\u2019s right. Well not pretty sharply but it is shifting. And those margins have been compressed for the reasons we\u2026 Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen & Company:   Okay. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead. David Strauss \u2013 UBS: Good morning, Phebe? Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi, David. David Strauss \u2013 UBS: Want to ask you about the balance sheet, even with the big quarter in terms of share repo you sit on net cash position I know you committed to returning 100% of free cash flow this year but would still be in a net cash position. So can you just talk about thoughts from the balance sheet any kind of leverage levels you are thinking about just utilizing looking to utilize balance sheet little bit more? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic: Let me give you sort of overarching view and then I\u2019ll let Jason give you some more color. But we used our balance sheet when we believe that there's an appropriate opportunity to make accretive investments. We have sufficient cash flow for this year to support the kind of share repurchases and dividends that we anticipate. So I frankly like where we are, and we like our credit rating we want to retain it. We don\u2019t see any reason to leverage the balance sheet to get a quick path in share repurchases that aren\u2019t necessarily repeatable in the next year. And this is too much of your future flexibility, not what we want to be. Jason W. Aiken: Yeah and just to add to that maybe in the quarter you saw that we did essentially \"use the balance sheet to the tune of a billion dollars\" that was really the effect of the ASR and fulfilling the commitments that we made last year which earned free cash flow to shareholders. So that was in effect our use of the balance sheet for this year and it really articulated both the plans just want to get efficient free cash flow forecasted and find that try to return that to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. David Strauss \u2013 UBS: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi George. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Phebe since you are not changing any guidance at this point on the sectors is it fair to assume that the increase in your EPS is coming primarily from the share buybacks because you historically don\u2019t ever factor that into your guidance? Phebe N. Novakovic:  It comes from three things. The maintaining or at least anticipating the EPS-based on our current share count. We see operating improvements that are driving about half of our current increase in our estimates on EPS. And but that we are not in a position to parse that, those operating improvements with any details among the four units. That\u2019s why I think I am far more comfortable in giving you that kind of color on the second quarter when we\u2019ve got more clarity about where we\u2019ve been through the half of the year and how the rest of the year shapes up. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Okay and one follow-up. The 650 it's been lots of discussion in the paper is it used planes are commanding like a $10 million premium to what you are selling them for. I mean what\u2019s your plan as far as increasing the rate on that 650? Phebe N. Novakovic: You mean the -- what you mean the production rate? George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Increase in your production rate given that demand seems to be so strong. Phebe N. Novakovic: So we want to as you know our past behavior will influence us going forward. We raise our production rates when we are confident that we can execute efficiently, green deliveries and profitable, green deliveries and outfitting. You will recall on the 650 we spent a majority of last year working through the -- what we call the dis-equilibrium on the retrofit. So that's -- we're mindful that we had a pretty detailed plan that we effectively put behind us. But it seems to me a bit -- I guess imprudent to get up there and begun to pump up the production rate until we have got more experience on a quarter-by-quarter basis on both the green deliveries and outfitting. So we are properly balanced at the moment. We will consider increases in rates. We do that at the end of every year and then that's how we set our guidance for you in the following year. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company:  Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Hi. Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Phebe, I think last year you might have termed 2013 as a back-to-basics year. Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: And so, what's 2014 going to be about? Phebe N. Novakovic:  More back-to-basics. I don't think you can ever get away from absolute requirement to improve your operating performance quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. You never got enough, you're never done. So that is going to be a strategic focus and tactical execution of this management team going forward. In addition we are -- I think that's been clear from our behavior heretofore in the year that we anticipate the deployment of all if -- most if not all of our free cash flow in dividend and share repurchases.  So that's something we were not able to accomplish last year that we will. So increased focus on the shareholder friendly cash deployment and more blocking and tackling on operation, return in invested capital, expanding margin and managing for cash. It's just never done. Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Just a follow-up on that and I agree that makes a lot of sense, but somewhere in here, you need to make that there is the right investment for the future of each of the businesses. So you don't want to harvest too much to, and you clearly talk about whether it -- ships or Ohio class or this new opportunity internationally. But could you be -- could you give us a couple of other examples where in the couple of other business units where you are seeing new product that also going to provide some of this basic or organic growth? Phebe N. Novakovic:  Yes. So you quite rightly pointed out that in the marine group we have organic growth potential and therefore as you would expect we have invested in the marine group, largely in infrastructure and capital structure since those are capital intensive businesses. In combat, what we have really our raise on that the last year and for this year as well is to size that business accordingly. But we make investments as we go along in those lines of business where we see a profitable return. So I think you can see that and our expectations on ELS. We have invested by fairly significant investments in restructuring, why to make that business more competitive and we're beginning to see fruits of that labor. That's also true in the UK. You have had significant restructuring charges in the UK to make us more competitive, and position ourselves for again organic growth and that's in the IS&T business. Our Intel and ISR business, we continue to invest in appropriate with the returns we expect in the market. Our IT Services business is a low investment business by definition. So I don't really see an organic requirement to invest in the IS&T business in C4. We invest appropriately Canada and the UK and right size the business in the United States with the demand. Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Company: Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Godyn - Morgan Stanley :  Hey thank you for taking my question. We heard a lot of questions on the Aerospace segment but I wanted to ask one more. Phebe last quarter you mentioned that there would be a dramatic rise in fourth quarter margins as you thought about the cadence throughout the year. Just given with the performance in the first quarter and what we've heard about your guidance for the full year, I am not sure if that is still valid. Phebe N. Novakovic: I think I will anticipate where you are headed in this quarter. We pulled some of the margin performance into the first quarter so I expect the fourth quarter to be lighter than the first quarter. That is different than we anticipated when we gave the guidance which was light in the first quarter and then building with the strong fourth quarter. We still expect a strong fourth quarter but not at the same level for all the reasons that we've articulated this morning. John Godyn - Morgan Stanley : And perhaps the more important kind of takeaway from this is I think that had given some investors confidence that as we thought about 2015, the exit rate was robust and we would be set up for continued margin expansion in Aerospace. Is that framework still right?  [Technical Difficulty] Phebe N. Novakovic: Do we still have an analyst with a question? John Godyn - Morgan Stanley : Hi, this is John can you hear me? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes it's a good thing our communications products are more reliable than this thing, who knows what happened. John Godyn - Morgan Stanley : Glad to have you back. What I had asked was I think the comment about fourth quarter seeing a ramp has given some confidence on continued margin expansion in aerospace in 2015. Is that still the right framework to use today with the new guidance? Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think as we think about 2015 it's obviously too soon to tell and we'll -- there are lot of factors that will emerge during the course of the year that will influence and inform our margin guidance but we anticipate that aerospace will continue to have very strong margin performance, both at Gulfstream, both this year and but equally important in \u201915 at Gulfstream as the 650 continues to come down its learning curve, and also at Jet Aviation which is increasingly profitable. So nice performance at jet and they are positioned to increase their order book. They solved their operating challenges and so I expect more upside margin ignition from jet. John Godyn - Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic: Just thoughts about the future. Erin Linnihan : Adrienne, I think we have time for one more question. Operator :  The next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton :  Yes, good morning. I just want to ask one on Marine and maybe a follow-up. Phebe It looks like marine repair that business has been a real great growth driver for you over the last four or five years. I know you got done some deals there. But I am just wondering you know with the navy fleet staying at a pretty low level and being kind of tasked increasingly around the world. Is repair kind of an ongoing growth story for you from that perspective? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yeah, so you know I think somebody asked that question earlier about investments. Kind of this was the place where we made an investment, I was EDP at the marine group and I felt very strongly at the time that we needed to expand our repair footprint and we did that, so that we are now bi-coastal. In fact we are heavily represented in four of the five maybe home ports and we did that purposely with the expectation that as the fleet ages repair workflow increase. I frankly like repair work in general. It\u2019s steady, it\u2019s fairly predictable performance and very predictable performance if you know what you are doing and we do. So it\u2019s been a nice on the surface side, it\u2019s been a nice growth engine for us. We also just recently won up in the Pacific North West a very large repair contract for CVM. So that again expands our footprint b-coastally.  On the submarine side, submarine repair work tends to come from two sources, one excess workflow from the public yards and second emerging demand that as the fleet experiences issues well under sea, so in both of those instances we have seen fairly lumpy but when we get it pretty profitable submarine repair work. Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton : Got it. Phebe N. Novakovic: Your assumption is quite correct that we have liked those investments, the return on those investments that we made in surface repair business. Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton : Got it, thank you. And just one follow up on marine, I am just wondering as you ramp in commercial volumes you guys won a lot of orders there, if there\u2019s going to be any negative impact to marine margin and then a similar issue on marine margin, similar question about this recent Virginia sub marine pay load marginal issue, if that would be any impact to margin rate. Phebe N. Novakovic: So for very high performing shipyards, which our three shipyards are, margins change quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year almost entirely based on mix. So you would expect that when we get increase we get a new order we are going to see some margin compression, as we come down our learning curve you will see margins expand. That\u2019s true on both the Naval, ship building side as well as the commercial ship building side. So NASSCO had very, very good margin performance on both its navy and commercial ship building work revenue, largely driven by just performance improvement quarter-over-quarter, day-after-day. The pay load issue we don't anticipate any margin compression on the issue that has come up with the North Dakota. We discovered that in concert with our navy customer and are addressing their requirements to do a complete inspection. So no real I mean it was a surprise and unfortunate. But we are [nearly set back] with our flow under control and it's frankly it's a supplier issue and we will address that. Peter Skibitski -- Drexel Hamilton : Got it, very helpful, thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic: Thanks Erin Linnihan :  And Adrienne, thank you so much. Thank you everybody for staying with us through the technical difficulties. If you need to reach me I am at 703-876-3583. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for today's participation in the conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

My name is Glen and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions).   I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed. Erin Linnihan : Thank you Glen and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of 7.47 billion, an income from continuing operations of 646 million. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.88 per diluted share, $0.07 ahead of the year ago quarter and $0.11 per share better than consensus. While revenue was 360 million lower, 4.6% than the year ago quarter income from continuing operations was 6 million higher on the strength of 12.7 operating margins, a 40 basis point improvement. Sequentially revenue was up 209 million in earnings from continuing operations were up 50 million on a 70 basis improvement in operating margins. You will note in this quarter that we took a 105 million after tax charge and discontinued operations for the planned sale of our axle business.   Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2014, revenues were down modestly 2.7% against 2013 however earnings from continuing operations were up over 2.6% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.17 or 5%. In short we\u2019re off to a good start ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations leading to an improved outlook for the year. With respect to cash we had 791 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter about a 122% of net income from continuing operations. We had 1.132 billion for the first half, 91% of income from continuing operations and we fully expect a very strong third quarter. With respect to share repurchases in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 10.7 million shares for approximately 1.2 billion. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 25 million shares in the first half however do not expect share repurchase activity at this level in the second half of the year. We have frontend loaded the share repurchase program, we will in the market but at a more moderate pace. An important part of the story in the quarter and for that matter in the previous quarter as well with the substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog of 71.1 billion up from 55.9 billion at the end of the last quarter. Most of the growth occurred in the Marine Group, with the award of the Block-4 of the Virginia Class submarines. The IS&T Group also enjoyed a $468 million increase in total backlog. You may recall that the story in the first quarter was the tremendous growth in backlog and combat systems. In short the company\u2019s the backlog and total potential contract value is at it's highest point in the last four years. This provides a solid bedrock upon which growth will be built. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the for the half. I will then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and give you our updated EPS guidance for 2014. First Aerospace, Aerospace had a good quarter with modestly lower revenue 2.8% on mix shift. Timing of deliveries and absence of preowned sales. However stronger than anticipated margins at 19.2%, 30 basis points better than the year ago quarter kept operating earnings down only 5 million or 1.3%. Let me provide you with some complexion on the quarter. Gulfstream enjoyed continued improvement in 650 green manufacturing and completion margin that more than offset continued mix shift. Jet Aviation again made a good contribution with double digit operating margins. For the first half of 2014 Aerospace revenues were up 289 million or 7.5%, operating earnings were up 89 million, 12.7% a further manifestation of Jet Aviation\u2019s contribution and the continued performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in a 90 basis improvement and operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2013, all-in-all a really superb first half with a very nice order take in the second quarter. There was particularly strong interest in the G550 in the quarter. Combat systems once again demonstrated disciplined performance reporting 15% margin on revenue only a half a percent less than a year ago resulting in modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. Our domestic businesses have particularly strong margin on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS which had been impacted in the first quarter by additional restructuring charges returned to profitability with double-digit operating margins that we expect to improve on an accelerating basis through the remainder of the year. All-in-all a strong performance in a tough market environment. For the first half revenues are up 7.2% against the first half of 2013, operating earnings are down 16.5% principally as a result of the restructuring charge at ELS in Q1. However we expect operating earnings to be very strong in the second half. More in that subject when I provide guidance. Marine Group revenues were higher than in Q2, 2013 by 92 million, 5.2% but operating earnings and operating margins were down 2.2% and 70 basis points respectively entirely as a result of mix shift in the quarter. Nevertheless, both revenues and operating earnings were up nicely on a sequential basis. For the first half Marine Group revenues were up 67 million or 2% and operating earnings are up 3 million or 1% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.8 for the first half. IS&T, IS&T is the place where we expect tremendous revenues pressure for the year. You may recall that our initial guidance was a 20% decline in revenue year-over-year. Fortunately we\u2019re doing somewhat better than expected. Revenue was off by 387 million or 15.2% compared to the prior year second quarter and also down somewhat sequentially. On the other hand operating earnings were down only 10 million or 5.1%, a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The story for the first half is even better, revenues were down 553 million, 11.1% but operating earnings were down only 12 million, 3.1% on improved margins. This was very good operating leverage. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up with our EPS guidance for the year. For Aeroscape our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately 9 billion and operating margins around 17%. We now believe revenue will be offset that figure by about 250 million, the largest single driver of which is lower than anticipated preowned activity. On the other hand margins are expected to be about 18% for the year resulting in higher than anticipating operating earnings. The 18% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half largely due to mix shift and increased R&D spending. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenues to be off on unadjusted 2013 revenue by 4% to 4.5% with margins around 14%. We now expect revenue to off 2.8% from adjusted 2013 revenue or about 5.7 billion. Margins will be higher around 15% resulting in higher and predicted operating earnings. In Marine Systems we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue growth over 2013 a 4.5% and a margin rate of about 20 basis points better than previously forecast, once again resulting in higher operating earnings. For IS&T we previously guided to a revenue decline of 20% and a margin rate of 8.2%. It now appears that revenue will be down 15% and the margin rate should be about the same as our previous guidance, once again this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year. In summary all of this rolls into revenue for the year around 30.2 billion and operating margin of 12.5% and a return on sales from continuing operations of 8.5%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations between $7.40 and $7.45. The progression through the remainder of the year is -- of the third quarter will look a lot like the second with a very strong fourth quarter to finish. And now I would like to turn the mike over to Jason Aiken to give you additional detail. Jason Aiken :  Thank you Phebe. Good morning. I will touch on just a few miscellaneous financial items before the question and answer period. As Phebe mentioned the results for the quarter include a charge of a $105 million in discontinued operations. In the quarter we engaged in the plan to sell the axle business in our Combat Systems Group. This action requires that we assess whether the price we expect to receive for this business is sufficient to cover the carrying value of it's net assets including an allocation of goodwill. This assessment resulted in the charge you see in the quarter in discontinued operations. The estimate will be trued up when the sale is completed which we expect to occur by the end of the year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $18 million in the second quarter of 2013. We had additional interest income in 2013 that reduced the net interest expense in that period and for 2014 we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter we\u2019re in a net debt position that\u2019s debt in excess of cash of $69 million. This reflects a $450 million swing from a net cash position in the prior quarter due to our activities on the capital deployment front which I will address just in a minute. As a reminder we have $500 million of notes maturing in January of next year and we will make a decision as we get closer to the end of this year as to whether to repay or refinance those notes. Our effective tax rate was 30.2% for the quarter slightly lower than expected as a result of higher international earnings which carry a lower tax rate. Based on our experience so far this year and the growing impact of international earnings we\u2019re now expecting the full year effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previous guidance of 30.5% to 31%. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2014 to be around $550 million, as a reminder most of that funding is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of the year. With respect to capital deployment in the quarter we continued our commitment to deploy capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Phebe gave you the details of our share repurchases a few minutes ago and in total we expended almost $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividend payments in the quarter. And over the past 18 months we returned over a 115% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. At the end of the second quarter we have $3.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well-positioned to continue to execute our strategy and achieve the objectives that Phebe has articulated for 2014. Erin that concludes my remarks and I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan : Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you\u2019ve additional questions please get back into the queue. Glen could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse :  I wanted to ask you Phebe on the Aerospace. You\u2019ve done so well with the margins here and you\u2019re guiding down a little bit on mix and R&D I think in the second half of the year but given that you\u2019ve traditionally level loaded your R&D even if you should come out with a new program in the fall, might we expect that this guidance continues to be a bit conservative especially with continued improvement at Jet. Phebe Novakovic : Let me walk you through that a bit, as you quite rightly point out we anticipate seeing some margin compression from mix shift and higher R&D and that\u2019s net R&D because we do not anticipate the same level of launch assistance so that is -- we level it low at our R&D but launch assistance drives some variability. Say fewer jet contributions going forward. But I think it's a good opportunity to spend a moment on Aerospace margins a bit and to give you a little bit additional color on what drives the variability quarter-over-quarter in these lines of business. The fundamental principle that I think we have to keep in mind the underlying operating performance of each of these businesses is getting better quarter-over-quarter and if it weren\u2019t I would tell you. So what does that mean? Well this means that there are other factors in these very complex businesses that impact margin, not one of which is necessarily material but in combination they can have some impact on a quarter-by-quarter basis. You know we have got mix shift between large cabin and mid cabin and service mix that mix. Also on volume by the way and it depends on the kind of service volume. The more complex service work, you get the higher margins you carry and for Gulf and this is true both at Gulfstream and Jet.  For Gulfstream as an OEM the more parts that they sell out of warranty, the higher the margin. So there is even within the inter-service business some various margin variability. With respect of Jet Aviation you get margins that are quarter-over-quarter, somewhat driven by where we\u2019re in contracts. Think about Jet as a construction contract and what they do particularly with respect to completions. With newer contracts we start off with lower margin and then build as we come down our learning curve. So again that drive some variability. Sales expenses of both business has changed and as I noted launch assistance is lumpy and of course as you all well know preowned is almost always a zero margin business. So I think -- I thought it was worth just spending a little bit of time talking about why it is that we see some variability. I emphasize again though that the operating the fundamental operating performance remains improving quarter-over-quarter. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : I wanted to ask if also with the 650 are we at the point where that\u2019s margin accretive and you mentioned better order flow there, obviously you\u2019ve been sold out for long time. Is the order renewal or the -- what I would consider new momentum maybe it's not. Is this a function of a change in the end market or is it because the other guy is now probably fairly sold out so availability is no longer a differentiator. Phebe Novakovic : Well availability is a differentiator to the extent that you actually have product. I think the way to think about, you had a couple of questions here but let me answer your last one first. I think the way to think about 650 demand is that we continue to see demand for that airplane, new demand and we have added not in large quantities as you would expect when there was a four year wait. But we have added almost every single quarter 650 orders. So that continues, there is a lot of interest in that business and by the way as we have worked through on that line of business in that airplane, as we work through the backlog we have accelerated the availability dates by about two quarters. So that\u2019s a benefit to our customers as well. Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So that\u2019s higher rate? Phebe Novakovic : It's a higher rate and you would expect that as we have come down our learning curve and as we continue to move green airplanes through the manufacturing line and then into the completion centers. With respect to margins I believe that 650 margins, I believe that I told you -- I told the Street maybe last quarter that we have exceeded the 450 and are working our way up to the 550 but that\u2019s probably several quarters away. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed. David Strauss - UBS: Phebe on IS&T you did revise the revenue guidance off now down 15% but still calls for a pretty significant larger decline in the second half of the year, can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that? And then on combat margins, it looks -- if I got it right, it's 15% margin guidance? It looks like it's implying a pretty big pick up in the back half of the year if you can just comment on that as well. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So let me address your last question first, I told you all in the first quarter that combat margins was significantly and quickly recovered and they did and they were even more. I mentioned in my remarks that we took a $29 million restructuring charge in Q1 at ELS and with that behind and that business hits 10% margins this quarter and we expect them to continue to improve over the course of the year and both of our businesses continue their strong performance. So it's pretty much in-line with what we had anticipated. Going forward they are just doing better than we had thought and that\u2019s why we\u2019re raising our margin guidance for the year. With respect to sales on IS&T we had believed that the frontend would be, the first half of the year would be somewhat frontloaded and it does imply some sales slowdown in the second half and that\u2019s consistent with what we had anticipated. We were pleased that the sales decline was less intense than we had thought and by the way that was across an entire spectrum of the businesses in both our IT business and Intel Business and coms business. So that was a nice sales performance in the first half and then some of the decline in sales that we anticipated that I think I told you guys before that this was -- we were risk adjusting our plan for army exposure and then that has happened but I would note that some of those we\u2019re seeing indications that some of those lines of business are beginning to stabilize. For example in our tactical ISR comps, computing, modeling and simulation were all -- we took our decline but they are holding up pretty well. IT services worked for the army is also holding up nicely. What continues to be a weakness and a weakness that there isn't a whole lot that we can do anything about is in the sustainment and repair business. The army is taking all their work into the public depots [ph]. So as a result we\u2019re doing almost nothing for the army in that line. So I think that addresses both of your questions. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research :  Two quick questions, mix was worse in Q2 than Q1 but the margin was a little higher in Q2 to -- versus Q1 in Aero. So I was just wondering what your explanation for that was and then the other one is I assume the book to bill would have been above one if I took out the fact that it was probably below one for the 650 and you are still expecting a 118 large deliveries for the year. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : I had a little trouble following the puts and takes on the first part of your question but let me address the orders because I think that\u2019s kind of what you were getting at a little bit. We had a book to bill of about nine times and it was really a good, good strong order quarter for us. We had said that -- what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of interest in the pipeline. It's just taking longer to close and so we have found that we have some variability in our order intake quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s what has happened. This quarter a lot of those orders came to fruition. So it was a nice quarter. By the way I have been tracking for you all the 450 and 550 which is where we look for these, where we would like to see in the moment. The order activity and once again for 450 and 550 they were 75% of the order book. The 280 was also strong. With respect to our green deliveries, we set a target every year that is right at the plan around how many green deliveries that we intend to have in the quarter or in the year and it's primarily driven by a host of factors. We have frequently taken it upon ourselves to sometimes rephase those deliveries. So you noted that we had slightly fewer deliveries in the second quarter than the first quarter but that we were -- we anticipate upticks in particularly the large cabin orders in the deliveries in the second half of the year. So all of that is meant to say that some of the timing -- some of the deliveries on green has been a question of timing and we have rephased that. So I think we\u2019re looking at the moment which could change in about a 116 versus a 118 and again simply driven by timing. You would be surprised how frequently customers ask for flipping the green delivery or the completions delivery into the next quarter subsequent quarter or the subsequent year. So again it's nothing but timing. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research :  On the first quarter what I was getting at was you had 29 large and six mid-sized versus this quarter, 26 and seven. So I figured the mix was worse this quarter yet the margin this quarter was 19.2% versus 19% in the first quarter so you kind of overcame the mix maybe because of 650 productivity. Phebe Novakovic : You got it. That\u2019s it. Improvement on the 650 and also on the 280 but you got it, 650 did very well. George Shapiro - Shapiro Research : Okay so why won't that continue in the second half? Phebe Novakovic : Well because of all the reasons I have just explained. We have got a mix shift among those three kinds of categories, large cabin, mid cabin and service and we have got higher R&D and Jet\u2019s contribution while good, is going to be less. So those three factors are a compression on margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Could we shift to NASSCO, maybe tell us a little bit about the commercial ship building business, how it's doing and the prospect you\u2019ve for new orders. Phebe Novakovic :  For a number of years we talked about the impending return of the Jones Act market and it came and since that market has picked we have contracted for 10 Jones Act ship. It remains a very attractive market to us and the pipeline remains fairly robust and we\u2019re in constantly communication and dialogue negotiations with potential customers. It's a good market, it's a price competitive market as you might imagine but I would note that this is not a place and not a market in which compete solely on price and are willing to use price as a differentiator, it's just too much risk in our profitability. So, we\u2019re in the midst right now of ramping up a member of our new commercial orders and that has some -- you didn\u2019t ask this question but it's implied, margin compression in the group but again that\u2019s simply a question of moving from mature MLP and coming up the learning curve down the learning curve on commercial. So it's a nice market, it fills out NASSCO work flows very, very well. We have learned to build these ships efficiently. So I like it. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Given that basically you\u2019re building essentially the same ship, should we expect the margins there to improve so this becomes a mix process as opposed to currently a mix negative? Phebe Novakovic : Overtime absolutely but you would expect that from the shipyards, right? Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company: Yes, okay. And I mean -- Phebe Novakovic : By the way these are not exactly the same ship, so don\u2019t think about it as a serial production on exactly the same specs. But there are differences but that said this yard will perform -- better and better performance as the programs mature. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan: Phebe on the AxleTech divestiture, this is I think one of the first portfolio decisions you\u2019ve made after -- you mentioned last year you were overhauling the M&A procedures internally. So I was wondering if you could comment on the process you went through in deciding to divest why you\u2019re doing it and whether you\u2019re looking at further divestitures, if this sort of opens the gates to lot of more portfolio activity. Phebe Novakovic :  Sure. Just to give you a little bit of retrospective, AxleTech was for many years a very, very good business, as we were the merchant supplier for almost all of the variances of MRAP. We made a lot of money on that acquisition years ago. As the war wound down and the government decided not to initiate a program to repair or retrofit MRAPs the fundamentals of that axle market changed dramatically and now the -- what we see is think about it this way, a complete inversion of the demand curve on commercial with the demand curve of defense work. So that told us that and we believe by the way that\u2019s a systemic change. So that told us that the value proposition really no longer obtained for us and that we believed and I still do that a commercial facing owner could be could be a better steward of the company. So I think you can expect us to respond as a market when we believe that there have been systemic changes and reacting according to our shareholders best interest. We have done a number of little pruning through like very small lines of business really limited in products just as again we changes in the market. But when we put together ATP and OTS we did a strategic analysis of every single one of our lines of business and what was core and where we thought that we could add value and this was one of those businesses that we felt could do better with a different parent and a different home. So I think you would expect us to react to our market. I don\u2019t see any major divestitures on the horizon. We have tinkered within the IS&T portfolio but nothing that changes the nature of that portfolio. So these will be opportunistic as we proceed and make these decisions fairly deliberatively and we have a very disciplined process for executing the sales. So I think this was a wise move and it's good for all. Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan: Can you provide us with the expected level of proceeds from the divestiture? Phebe Novakovic : Well not yet, everybody who is a perspective buyer would be listening. So, we will disclose how we do after we finish the transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein : You\u2019re in a position at Gulfstream where you\u2019ve got G650, a unique position in the market. You\u2019ve said that the 550 has strong interest yet right now you\u2019re at the lowest level of backlog in aerospace in one in five years and I\u2019m just trying to understand how to fit that level of backlog with the program strengthens you\u2019ve? Phebe Novakovic : So Doug, I\u2019ve tried to articulate this before. Think about our backlog as driven primarily by and predominantly by the 650 order book that we took in 5 or 6 years ago. That backlog provided for five or six years of sales activity on the 650. We\u2019re drawing that down and I think that\u2019s indicative as we would expect and totally wholesome and I believe that that\u2019s an implied from the acceleration in the availability times by about two quarters which I just told -- we just discussed a few minutes ago. So we had a book to bill of 0.9. I don\u2019t worry about the level of the backlog given the duration of that large program. I think it's very wholesome. There was nothing that we see in the order activity that causes us concern. Our pipeline is very robust, it's robust on the 650 as well. I think the customers and potential customers will be happy that they don\u2019t have wait for quite such a long time for their airplanes. So I don\u2019t worry about this. This is not some harbinger of a market issue at least with respect to us that I think we need to be worried about or our shareholders need to be worried about. Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein : Well do you see a point here as you start to -- as you increase that availability take rate up. Should we expect the backlog to eventually turn up the other way as you start to increase rate or is this something where you see this kind of level as sort of the right level going forward? Phebe Novakovic : Well look a lot of depend on a number of factors, all right? Including how we think about new airplanes that we may bring into the market. So you know the right level of backlog is the backlog that you can that sustains reasonable sales growth and allows us to continue to be a very profitable company and I think that we have got that now and I don\u2019t see any sign that that\u2019s going to be particularly troubling. I don\u2019t have a target backlog. That ebbs and flows. The 650 was such a large order that you have to think about it more like some of the big ship orders. It was big and it was binary, that\u2019s unusual in the business Jet Aviation market, right? So it is pervaded [ph] that backlog but if you look prior to the 650 announcement our backlog was pretty consistent driven by the economic environment and as we have added more airplane models we have increased that backlog and then the 650 just changed the nature of that backlog. So I think we have all gotten used to seeing it but it was an anomaly, because rarely do you ever see I don\u2019t think ever has anybody ever seen that kind of big and binary change, more like the ships right? Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein : I understand, it's just that when I look at the numbers today and you think of sort of backlog to revenues the numbers are actually even lower today than they were prior to the 650 launch in terms of that ratio. So I just wanted to understand if you saw an issue there but it sounds like you\u2019re seeing things as pretty much where you want them to be in terms of demand. Phebe Novakovic : Yes and absolutely and let me just also say that I think the entire industry right around the run-up to the great recession. The market was unhealthily overheated. I look to see -- I look at backlog to ensure that we have enough in our order book to sustain a growth in sales and a growth in profitability. I\u2019m very comfortable where we\u2019re now and I see no signs in our market that it's superheated or that we\u2019re experienced any particular anomaly or something that we should be concerned. That\u2019s why I have been reporting to you all where we look every quarter in our backlog as a 450-550 orders because you can\u2019t add materially to the 650. That dynamic with respect to the 650 will change as we shorten the availability times, right? Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein : That absolutely makes sense and certainly that\u2019s one of the things that we have looked for is that you\u2019ve this upward pressure to see when you can take those rates up and even get more availability. Phebe Novakovic : And there you\u2019ve it. But we\u2019re not about pre-announce that, we make our rate decisions based on very disciplined analysis those of factoring a whole lot of independent variables right? So that\u2019s within our I think in our to-do list, right? Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed. Howard Rubel - Jefferies: First I actually want to ask Jason a question, I figured you didn\u2019t want him to be there or neglected and it looks like the way you bought back stock it was very much backend loaded when we look at the share count so that we should expect to fairly sharp decline sequentially in shares outstanding in the third quarter versus where you were in the second. Is that correct? Jason Aiken : When you say at the end of the third quarter or is it at the end of the second quarter? Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Excuse me, I apologize. It appears as if you have bought most of the shares towards the end of the second quarter because the difference between the weighted share count in the period and the share end number is fairly significant. Jason Aiken : I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to that conclusion. The activity was spread right throughout the quarter and what you maybe seeing as the offsetting impact of stock option exercise activity and other factors that go into the weighted average calculation but no anomaly driving the share count or the repurchase activity towards the end of the quarter. Phebe Novakovic :  We did an accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter but the second quarter was just steady eddy throughout the quarter. Howard Rubel - Jefferies: And then second Phebe, you\u2019ve focused a lot on making a difference cost as an effective competitive tool. Could you address a little bit of how that\u2019s helped you either win some business or positioned you to win some business both at combat systems and at IS&T? Phebe Novakovic : Absolutely. One of my favorite subjects. Let me give you the easiest and the most glaring frankly example. At ELS we had a cost structure going into 2013 that was so high it made them anti-competitive, just couldn\u2019t win any orders. So we needed to get after that cost structure and we did it quickly, in a disciplined fashion. We did the same thing at GDUK and the results we\u2019re seeing is in GDUK we actually had a C4 [ph] owns GDUK. We actually had a contract that we had been disqualified from because of high cost. We opened for us to go back into the competition because we had lowered our cost so dramatically and in a head to head competition with multiple other suppliers we won. I mean that is a simple and I think powerful example of what right sizing your business can do. It's a right thing to do for your shareholders, for your customer so that we can provide the services at competition rates and the same thing is happening in European Land Systems. So those were the two obvious examples but we\u2019re seeing that throughout as C4 Systems has reduced it's business and restructured it's business dramatically since the fourth quarter of 2013. They have increased their order activity particularly in their overseas market, Canada and the Mid-East and to the extent that they are going in head to head competition. We have been doing very, very well in our capture rate. The same thing is true with our Intel business and the same thing is true with our IT business. So I\u2019m very pleased with the performance of the company as we have focused getting back to the basics of operating excellence and they have got more to go but they have made progress. Combat Systems has had a long track record of disciplined response to their market and anticipating changes in their market and getting after their fixed cost quickly. There is no such thing as we say as fixed cost, they will ultimately turn into variable. So they have right sized their business even in advance of the change in their market conditions and I think you can see the result of that in their margin improvement, and in their margin performance. Howard Rubel - Jefferies: Just to follow-up on land systems or combat, I\u2019m still sort of looking at sort of the market color for opportunities. Can you either geographically or product line or some way characterize how there has been very specific interest? Phebe Novakovic : So we continue to see within our land force as U.S. Land Forces line of business. Interest in terms of sustainment levels right? So we anticipated that and we see that, it's not a lot of -- I don\u2019t believe new opportunities on that front. We\u2019re however engaged in a number of international opportunities with all of the three businesses in our combat systems. The timing of the clarity around timing of international orders has been a little elusive, so I\u2019m not about to speculate but our negotiation on several potential contracts and we will see how those turn out but there is still a lot of interest. The world hasn\u2019t gotten any safer. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities : Just wanted to follow back up on the AxleTech discussion. Can you just size that business and I\u2019m trying to just think about how much of the original sales decline was because of that business and then the absence of it how that\u2019s playing into the combat outlook for the year? Phebe Novakovic : You can sort of infer that from the restated sales number but that business has for the last really year undergone a precipitous decline in sales and the inversion of demand. So, I\u2019m not going to parse out exactly the size but you can -- when we get around to selling it we will in disposing of it and finalizing the contract will give you a little bit more clarity but it was responsible for some of the decline clearly, you can see that. Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities :  And then you had mentioned about risk adjusting for the U.S. Army business. If I remember right going into the year, you implied kind of a 40% reduction year-over-year, can you talk about where you stand year-to-date and what you\u2019re expecting now from U.S. Army business? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so that business is consistent other than the sustainment of that line of business which really hits the IS&T business units more than it does the combat systems business units. We\u2019re down to around 20% and declining. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed. Carter Copeland - Barclays: Just question regarding announcements made by peers yesterday on two fronts the first obviously you\u2019re partner on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program took a pretty sizeable charge with the completion of that and renegotiation with the customer and they have lengthened out the entry in the service dates on some of those aircraft. I wondered if you could speak to the impacts that you may see from that and how you will go about evaluating that and then secondly, Lockheed who is a set contractor on the scout vehicle to you, he was talking about a pretty sizeable award they were excited about from a potential standpoint from the UK and I wondered if you could speak to timing and size or just general color about that opportunity and what it could mean for GDUK? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic :  Yes let me talk about MHP. For the first time in many years this program has a stable way forward and has upside opportunity. We did not take charge on that program, we don\u2019t intend to take a charge as a result of the renegotiation. We\u2019re the supplier for Sikorsky. We have developed over the years a very good relationship with our supplier. We have been very supportive with our prime. We have been very supportive of them and this was a very significant risk reduction result for us and we have stabilized it and going forward there will be some upside. So that was very, very good move. On the SV vehicle -- Lockheed may have more information than we do but I have, this is one of the many, many markets that we continue to investigation and we\u2019re there. We\u2019re at the prime and on the SV [ph] - the development of the SV and how the British government and the Ministry of Defense chooses on a going forward basis to think about the production contract, it's something we start to work out with them but they are going to make that call. Carter Copeland - Barclays: How would you think about the significance of that order relative to some of the other big orders you\u2019ve talked about in combat in the past? Phebe Novakovic :  Well it would be a nice order and again that is entirely driven by the druthers of that customer and what they want to see in near term production. So, the developmental program went from a very risky position to one that we have stabilized that and we have gotten it back on track technically scheduled wise and we\u2019re -- we have done a good job and land systems team did a very good job. I\u2019m a big believe that if you don\u2019t build the platform you can\u2019t integrate it. So they build those platforms, they know them, it's our core competency that\u2019s probably one of the best in the world if not the best in the world at that and they were able to turn around a very broad program. So it's an opportunity going forward but that will be dictated in its entirety by our customer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed. Ron Epstein - Bank of America : On Gulfstream just to maybe follow-up on some of the previous questions. The increase in activity that you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve mentioned in your prepared remarks about the G550. Can you speak about regionally where you\u2019ve seen it? Is it out of the emerging world? Is it out of Europe? Is it out of the U.S.? Where are you seeing maybe the tick up in demand? Phebe Novakovic :  In each one of our airplane models what we have seen is North America is the 50% of the orders for the last 18 months. So pretty consistent North America involvement and activity in ordering. Sometimes that small fleet, corporate fleet replacement or individuals but I got to tell you the vast majority of the orders are from Fortune 500 and both primarily North America, public and private companies but also international public and private companies. Ron Epstein - Bank of America : Okay. And in the midsized market have you seen much of the pickup there yet or is that still kind bouncing along? Phebe Novakovic :  The 280 had a nice quarter and that airplane gets overshadowed by the 650 but it is a terrific plane in it's space and it's in niche and it's doing well. It's fits a discernible need with great capabilities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed. Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada : Phebe, also related to your peers it does seem that a couple of them have been picking up their M&A activity since the start of the year. Are you in any way tempted to get back involved in this game? Phebe Novakovic : We have seen -- look I\u2019m not going to speculate on that we have seen a bit of a trickle but a trickle is not a trend mix so it's hard to know the maturity of the M&A market but so far we\u2019re not there. Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada : And then as a second question, really a follow-up to Ron\u2019s question. Have you seen any changes in the pricing dynamics for new aircraft? Phebe Novakovic : No our prices are holding up nicely. But the corollary to your question is we\u2019re not winning these airplane orders on price, it's factor but it's one of many. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank : Maybe talk about the capital deployment for just a second. I know you have made a mention of the $500 million note coming due in January and your decision has been made to refi or repay yet. And I just wonder that in any way going to play into how you\u2019re going to deploy free cash flow for repurchase. It looks like it's about a $1 billion after dividends of free cash flow you will have in the second half of the year to maintain this neutral position you have now on net debts. I think about that as your repo target unless I\u2019ve to think about the refinance or repayment of the note as well. So if you can maybe -- are those two connected? Phebe Novakovic :  Well I think if you think about it that note is due in January. We really haven't gotten -- we really haven't put our -- focused our attention on 2015 capital deployment but you can rest assured we intend to be shareholder friendly as we have in this year. Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank :  And then clarification are you still holding 40 midsized deliveries in \u201814 or is it just picked up in the midsize in terms of demand or maybe it's a little bit less. Phebe Novakovic : We have had a couple of move around so nothing particularly material. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed. Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi: Phebe just a quick question on margins. I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts on what you think normalized margins at Jet Aviation are going to be over the longer term and then same for combat systems. Just long term structural margins in that business over the next several years is, you look at all the cost activities that you\u2019ve taken over the past couple of years and make the business going forward. Phebe Novakovic :  Jet Aviation has been a story all about walking out of the shadow of the valley of death and they -- their margin performance has been increasingly positive quarter-over-quarter. They have some variability but on a quarter-to-quarter basis but the underlying operations have done very, very well and will continue to do well in every indication we see all of the metrics we watch, the EACs we built. Everything I see is on the upper trajectory and I think it's too soon to have for me to give you a definitive where out there sustaining margin to be. I have an aspiration that I\u2019m fully confident that Jet will make but that\u2019s an internal discussion that we have to have but they are on the right path. Now combat, I think combat -- you know combat is all going to be about their orders which they have stabilized their order and then their performance on those orders and these lines of businesses have demonstrated that they are very good operators. So I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself for 2016 but we ought to see some nice margin improvement in combat. There is nothing structurally that\u2019s keeping them from not continuing to build their operating efficiency and add to it. And operator I think we have time for one more call. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed. Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton : Phebe, I just want to ask you about 2014 guidance overall especially the defense revenues you\u2019re forecasting. It looks like all the congressional appropriations committees have reported out but it looks like maybe won't create a bill until after the November election. I was just wondering if you feel like there is any risk to your guidance from a CR [ph] that goes to November - December? Phebe Novakovic : Not anything we can materially see. Most of what we have got is in our backlog upon which we have projected our guidance to you. Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton :  Okay. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : All right. I think that\u2019s it for today. Thank you so much for joining our call. If you\u2019ve additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

My name is Tihisha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of IR, Investor Relations. Please proceed. Erin Linnihan : Thank you Tihisha and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic :  Good morning. As you can observe from our earnings report, we enjoyed a particularly compelling quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.05 per fully diluted share on revenues of 7.75 billion, and income from continuing operations of 694 million, this is $0.21 per share better than the year ago quarter and $0.14 per share better than consensus. Revenue was up 60 million against the year ago quarter, operating earnings were up 38 million or 4%, and income from continuing operations was $42 million higher. Operating earnings of 999 million reflect 12.9% operating margins, a 50 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2013. Sequentially the news is much the same, revenue was up 277 million, 3.7%. Operating earnings were up 50 million on a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins and earnings from continuing operations were up 48 million. Finally, EPS was $0.17 better than last quarter. In short, we experienced the highest revenues so far this year, had the highest operating earnings in four years, the highest margins in six years, and the highest earnings from continuing operations on my watch. This led quite naturally to the strongest quarterly EPS we have ever had, all pretty powerful and the strong indication that our focus on operations is paying dividends. With respect to cash, we had 2.33 billion of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 330% of net income from continuing operations. We have 3.46 billion year-to-date, 179% of net income from continuing operations. However a word of caution here, some of this cash is from advanced payments on international orders and will be deployed in future quarter for pragmatic purposes and leans the balance sheet. That having been said, it was still a very powerful quarter from a cash perspective. With respect to share repurchases, in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 3.8 million shares for approximately 468.5 million. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 28.8 million year-to-date for about 3.2 billion. We plan for modest share repurchase activity in the final quarter of the year with a resumption of increased activity early next year. As you can see from the backlog charts that we attached to the press release, this quarter is also a story of continuing growth in the backlog. Once again there was a substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with the total backlog at an all-time APEX of 74.4 billion up from 71.1 billion at the end of the last quarter. All of this growth occurred in Combat Systems Group largely the result of international orders. You may recall that at the end of the third quarter of 2013 Combat Systems had a backlog of almost 7.8 billion. It now stands at 21.6 billion, more than a three-fold increase. If we look back over the last year for the entire Company, you will see a similar story. Our backlog has grown from 47.8 billion a year ago to 74.4 billion today, from my perspective, pretty impressive. Looking forward towards the fourth quarter, we would expect the Aerospace Group to enjoy very strong order intake as the result of the introduction of the two new aircraft announced this month, along with a growing interest in existing products, impart precipitated by the new product announcements. In other words, customers can now choose between the near-term availability of G450 and G550 and no longer wait for new products, with different speeds, ranges and price points. The clarity of these options for customers is helping drive decision-making. Before I turn this cal over to Jason Aiken to give you some segment details, I will note that I was particularly pleased by the revenue and earnings growth of the Aerospace Group, the continued excellent margin performance of Combat Systems, the revenue growth in the Marine Group, and the steadily improving margins at IS&T. We\u2019re not where we want to be at IS&T but we\u2019re improving. Jason? Jason Aiken :  Thank you, Phebe. As Phebe indicated, the quarter was marked by very strong operating results from each of our business groups. I\u2019ll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenues, earnings and margins were all up from the year ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The Group reported sales just shy of $2.3 billion up from the third quarter of 2013 by 6.4%. Operating earnings increased 11.4% over 2013 to $411 million, the highest level of quarterly earnings the Aerospace Group has ever seen. Operating margins were up 90 basis points to 18% on improved performance in G650 and G280 manufacturing and outfitting, as well as another good contribution from Jet Aviation. On a sequential basis, the Group experienced some margin compression from the first half consistent with our expectations. This is attributable to a variety of factors but primarily to the mix of aircraft deliveries and an increase in pre-owned aircraft activity. Of course the aircraft\u2019s mix is more than just large versus mid cabin, keep in mind it includes the variety of models within those categories. Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues and operating earnings were also up compared with third quarter 2013. In the quarter, sales were up 6.8% to $1.4 billion, while earnings were up 1.8% to $232 million. Taking with the second quarter that was essentially flat year-over-year, it would appear that we found the bottom with respect to sales for the Group. As expected the Group\u2019s margin rate while exceptionally strong was down from a year ago when the Group posted its highest margins in its history. In fact barring the third quarter of last year the Group\u2019s margin this quarter were the highest they\u2019ve ever been. So far this year the Combat Systems Group has experienced very strong performance with an operating margin rate of 14.4% year-to-date. When we look sequentially, revenues were down $70 million from the second quarter, but operating earnings and operating margins were both up, $12 million and 160 basis points respectively. This reflects the impact of the various restructuring actions taken in the past 18 months across the Group\u2019s businesses, including a significant reduction in our European cost base and last year\u2019s combination of two of our U.S.-based businesses. With the last of the European restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of this year, the Group\u2019s margins have expanded significantly from the first quarter to the second, to the third. The cost reduction efforts position the Group well to execute on their strong backlog. Moving onto Marine Systems. The Marine Group\u2019s revenues were higher than 2013 both in the third quarter and the first nine months. Revenues in the quarter were up by 7.2% to over $1.8 billion, while year-to-date revenues increased by 3.7% to nearly $5.3 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the Group\u2019s submarine programs and commercial ship construction activities. The Group has started construction on the fourth block of Virginia-class submarines which was awarded in the second quarter and is continuing development activities on the Ohio-class submarine replacement program. Construction is also underway on the first three of 10 Jones Act ships under contract at our NASSCO shipyard. Operating earnings were steady compared with this point last year to $170 million and the Group\u2019s operating margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift. The Group is transitioning from Block-3 to Block-4 of the Virginia-class program and from the Mobile Landing Platform program to the new commercial ship contracts at NASSCO. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remained very respectable 9.7%. And finally IS&T. You may recall that we had expected a 20% decline in revenues this year for IS&T, but based on the strength of the first half of the year we adjusted that expectation on last quarter\u2019s call to a 15% decline. The Group continues to outperform our top-line expectation through nine months, with operating earnings following suite. Revenue of $2.25 billion in the quarter was off by about 13% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter. And on the other hand, operating earnings declined just 6.5%, roughly half the decline in sales to $202 million. As a result, operating margins increased by 60 basis points to 9% in the quarter. This is the Group\u2019s highest margin rate in the last three years, and marks the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion. All three of the Group\u2019s businesses contributed to this improved performance in the quarter. The story for the first nine months is similar. Revenues were approximately $6.7 billion down only 11.7% versus the expected 15%. However, operating earnings were down only 4.3% resulting in 70 basis points of margin improvement. When we look sequentially, revenues and earnings were both up $84 million and $14 million respectively. And as I noted earlier, the Group has expanded margins sequentially since the fourth quarter of last year demonstrating good operating leverage and the Group\u2019s ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. On that front during the quarter, we announced the decision to combine Advanced Information Systems and C4 systems effective January 1, 2015. We expect this combination in resulting restructuring efforts to make the combined organization General Dynamics Mission Systems more efficient, profitable and responsive to our customers. I\u2019d like to cover just a few miscellaneous financial items before I turn it back over to Phebe to wrap it up and begin the question-and-answer period. The net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $5.1 billion and the net cash position that\u2019s cash and equivalence in excess of debt of $1.7 billion. In this regard you should reflect on the cautionary note Phebe introduced on this subject in her earlier comments. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected due to the resolution of some open matters related to our 2013 tax returns. For the full year now reflecting on our experience to-date in the tax rate of 29.8% for the first nine months, we now expect an effective tax rate around 30%. We funded our pension plans in the quarter as anticipated bringing our contributions through the first nine months to just over $500 million. And I\u2019ll turn it back over now to Phebe to give you some wrap-up thoughts. Phebe Novakovic : All right. As we turn to guidance, I will be brief. Somewhat higher revenue, higher than anticipated operating earnings and a modestly lower tax rate combined to permit us to increase our guidance for EPS from continuing operations to $7.60 to $7.70, approximately $0.25 up from our last discussion with you. Now, let\u2019s get on to your questions. Erin? Erin Linnihan : Thanks Phebe. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Tihisha, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Question: and: Operator : No problem. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed. Jason Gursky : Good morning everyone. Phebe I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat Systems and what it pertains for margins out in the future, would you just offer your view on how profitable that increased book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems? Citigroup: Good morning everyone. Phebe I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat Systems and what it pertains for margins out in the future, would you just offer your view on how profitable that increased book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems? Phebe Novakovic : If we look into next year margins ought to look about the same as they do this year, because we really expect the ramp-ups in \u201916 and \u201917 and beyond. As we go through come down our learning curves, we\u2019re going to improve our operating earnings and margins. These will be very profitable programs because they\u2019re in our core we know how to produce them. And so we have strong expectations for Combat Systems\u2019 margin performance. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment that\u2019s going on there today? And whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin, getting a little worst just kind of contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings? Citigroup: Okay, great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment that\u2019s going on there today? And whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin, getting a little worst just kind of contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings? Phebe Novakovic : We\u2019re not seeing much of a change in our contract terms and conditions. And still as a result for us margin expansion is all about performance. And we\u2019ve seen some of that improved operating performance throughout that Group. Just give you an example we had a book-to-bill of one for the quarter in IS&T so nice order activity. And I really haven\u2019t seen any material change in the contracting. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. Thank you.  Citigroup: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Please proceed. Peter Arment : Thank you. Good morning Phebe. Just a question is on IS&T, you\u2019ve talked about the combination here creating this Mission Systems business, and you just mentioned the contracting environment. Do you think this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion or is there something structural that keeps it below 10% for the long-term? Sterne, Agee: Thank you. Good morning Phebe. Just a question is on IS&T, you\u2019ve talked about the combination here creating this Mission Systems business, and you just mentioned the contracting environment. Do you think this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion or is there something structural that keeps it below 10% for the long-term? Phebe Novakovic : I see no reason why this business can\u2019t get into the double-digits. We undertook this consolidation but the markets are changing so it was an opportune time for us to take a fresh look at our entire portfolio. And it became pretty clear to us that we were going to benefit from a consolidation. So from my perspective, the consolidation is going to result in additional cost savings going forward. So that is margin expansion opportunity. Peter Arment : Okay, I\u2019ll stick to the one. Thank you.  Sterne, Agee: Okay, I\u2019ll stick to the one. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Sam Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance, in terms of where that\u2019s changing, which are the different segments? Because I know, like as an example, IS&T, down 15%, is certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date so we\u2019d imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there is some changes amongst those? Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning. Phebe can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance, in terms of where that\u2019s changing, which are the different segments? Because I know, like as an example, IS&T, down 15%, is certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date so we\u2019d imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there is some changes amongst those? Phebe Novakovic : No, I think our guidance reflects our year-to-date performance and the fourth quarter is going to look very much like what we are leading, we\u2019re guiding to on the overall Company. So Marine will be a little bit up. And everybody -- all the other Groups are pretty much steady. There is some margin compression in IS&T but not much. So, I think when we\u2019ve increased our guidance really to reflect where we\u2019ve been and where we see going forward for the remainder of the year. So this is uncomfortable with our guidance. Sam Pearlstein : But in terms at least for the four segments, did the outlook changed relative to what you talked about? I am trying to just understand where you\u2019re moving that increase of $0.25 from? Wells Fargo Securities : But in terms at least for the four segments, did the outlook changed relative to what you talked about? I am trying to just understand where you\u2019re moving that increase of $0.25 from? Phebe Novakovic : Well, it\u2019s really kind of across the board. We\u2019ve got higher earnings and we anticipate higher earnings in Aerospace, higher earnings in the Marine Systems and well and higher earnings in Combat. So a little bit margin compression as I said in IS&T in the fourth quarter. But when you roll it all up where we\u2019ve been and what we see for the fourth quarter 7.60 to 7.70 is we\u2019re very comfortable with that. Sam Pearlstein :   Okay. Thank you.  Wells Fargo Securities :   Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed. Robert Stallard :  Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a couple of things on cash, and Phebe mentioned that the conversion rate would obviously be above average of the first nine months, where do you expect us to go in the future, are we going to get back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances? Royal Bank of Canada :  Thanks so much. Good morning. Just a couple of things on cash, and Phebe mentioned that the conversion rate would obviously be above average of the first nine months, where do you expect us to go in the future, are we going to get back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances? Phebe Novakovic :  We\u2019ll be at about at 100% as we begin to take that cash of the balance sheet and send it upon its way to our suppliers. So, we\u2019ve target about 100%. Robert Stallard : Okay. And\u2026 Royal Bank of Canada : Okay. And\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Still very good cash generation. Robert Stallard : Yes, on the [buying] is there any reason why you are easing off in the fourth quarter? Royal Bank of Canada : Yes, on the [buying] is there any reason why you are easing off in the fourth quarter? Phebe Novakovic : We\u2019ve told you all and our investors that we would deploy all of, most if not all of our free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends and we\u2019re about at that point. So, we\u2019ll go a little bit slower in the fourth quarter, but I expect to pick that activity back up in the beginning of the year. Robert Stallard : Great, thanks so much.  Royal Bank of Canada : Great, thanks so much. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. Doug Harned :  Yes, good morning. When you talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the 450 and the 550, what\u2019s the level of backlog that in terms of months that you\u2019re comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to keep production at the levels you\u2019re at today until the 500 and 600 come out. I am just curious where you stand today in terms of that and how you get confidence that you\u2019re going to be in a good position? Sanford Bernstein :  Yes, good morning. When you talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the 450 and the 550, what\u2019s the level of backlog that in terms of months that you\u2019re comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to keep production at the levels you\u2019re at today until the 500 and 600 come out. I am just curious where you stand today in terms of that and how you get confidence that you\u2019re going to be in a good position? Phebe Novakovic : Let me give you a little bit of color on that. In the quarter our backlog increased by a quarter for almost all of our models 650, 650/ER third quarter of \u201917, 550 first quarter of \u201916, 450 about the same, 280 third quarter of \u201915 and the 150 frankly the largest increase at the first quarter of 2016. So that provides us pretty steady production rate as we go forward to plan for the next at least 12 month period. And you recall we set our production rates at the end of the prior year and then we\u2019ll give you some details about those rates as we go forward. But it\u2019s too soon to predict, I think it's just too soon to project when we have any material changes in productions as a result of the new airplane. And when we get to that, get closer to that point we\u2019ll give you a little bit more clarity. Doug Harned : So is it fair to say you are looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand rolls out for each of the different models overtime? Sanford Bernstein : So is it fair to say you are looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand rolls out for each of the different models overtime? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, we always have flexibility. I think that agility helps us keep our profitability high and as we balance resources against demand. So, I am comfortable that as we stand here today we\u2019ve got an executable plan going forward and as I said as we get closer to the entry into service of the 500 and then the 600, we\u2019ll give you a little bit more color on to, into the relative production rates. Doug Harned : Okay, very good, thank you. Sanford Bernstein : Okay, very good, thank you. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Joe Nadol :  Thanks. Good morning, good results. Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple of quarters and you have indicated that it\u2019s transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia-class plus the MLP over to the new commercial ships. How are the ships coming, I mean this is your, this was your business before with your current position and so as you look at the early stages of the curves in the ships, how are they coming and where do you think the margins kind of bottom out before we start seeing an uptick as they mature? JPMorgan:  Thanks. Good morning, good results. Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple of quarters and you have indicated that it\u2019s transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia-class plus the MLP over to the new commercial ships. How are the ships coming, I mean this is your, this was your business before with your current position and so as you look at the early stages of the curves in the ships, how are they coming and where do you think the margins kind of bottom out before we start seeing an uptick as they mature? Phebe Novakovic : You pretty much got it right on the mix shift, we\u2019ve got mix shift from Block-3 to Block-4 and then the transition from the MLP to the Jones Act ships. It's an interesting, when you think about what NASSCO has been able to do, they have demonstrated that they can build these ships and meet the customer\u2019s needs competitively and profitably while they are continuing to deliver Navy ships. So the current work we have in-house at NASSCO provides us nice revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future. We\u2019ve got three ships in production they are all performing on or above plan. So I would -- now one thing one caution here is that think about commercial ship building as providing nice strong earnings but the margin are going to be a touch lumpier as we move from one ship class to the next ship class because these are shorter cycles and maybe ship building. So I suspect we\u2019ll see continued margin improvement at NASSCO and have elected photos as we work through some of these mix shifts. And I would suspect to see some of that next year and certainly going into \u201916 and beyond. Joe Nadol : Just to be specific, so, next year you expect to see margins start to perk up? JPMorgan: Just to be specific, so, next year you expect to see margins start to perk up? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, they ought to be, it ought to -- I expect we haven\u2019t done our detailed planning yet but I anticipate that they will somewhat near this year. Joe Nadol : Okay, thank you.  JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thanks so much Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Gulfstream, are the 650 margins kind of above, you said they\u2019re above the 450. Where are they relative to the 550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500 and what kind of impact is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks.  Cowen and Company : Yes, thanks so much Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on Gulfstream, are the 650 margins kind of above, you said they\u2019re above the 450. Where are they relative to the 550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500 and what kind of impact is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so the 650, and 650/ER margins are beginning to approach the 550 and I suspect sometime next year we may have the crossing point on that. We haven\u2019t yet planned out our cash in any detail with respect to the 500s and 600s. We expect to see some this year but more going into next year. And by the way, we\u2019ll give you a lot of color in the fourth quarter call in January about the order activity on both of those airplanes. Cai von Rumohr : Can you give us some additional color on that, on that order activity, or just the reception? And, whether you\u2026 Cowen and Company : Can you give us some additional color on that, on that order activity, or just the reception? And, whether you\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we announced at the rollout that we had several orders, large orders. And the order activity has been very positive since then. But I don\u2019t really want to give you a battlefield update and we\u2019re just barely end of this quarter. So we\u2019ll be able to give you some confirm color and details in the fourth quarter call. Cai von Rumohr : Okay, thank you. Cowen and Company : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple of updates on a couple of ground vehicle programs, I think we are in a bit of a state of flux for you guys; one is AMPV and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, could you confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially going to, are you officially out of that program at this point? And on\u2026 Wolfe Research : Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple of updates on a couple of ground vehicle programs, I think we are in a bit of a state of flux for you guys; one is AMPV and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, could you confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially going to, are you officially out of that program at this point? And on\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Hunter Keay : Yes, I was going to also ask on AMPV. So if you give me an update on that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Wolfe Research : Yes, I was going to also ask on AMPV. So if you give me an update on that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, we haven\u2019t played in the JLTV market and on AMPV. We\u2019re continuing to work with our customer on options for where our vehicles may make some sense. But our mature programs and our tanks and strikers are doing exactly what we thought they did would do and very good margin performance and good earnings. So, we have a lot of stability on those as of today on our Ground Systems\u2019 domestic markets. Hunter Keay : Okay, and just one quick follow-up. I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now? Thank you. Wolfe Research : Okay, and just one quick follow-up. I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : It is just for 650 the third quarter of \u201917. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Wolfe Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog, and just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a lot of what\u2019s happening is you\u2019ve been working off a very strong 650 bookings back in 2011. So there is distortion. Is there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries\u2019 orders, the introduction of these two new aircraft create new distortion in the next couple of quarters as these orders come in? Credit Suisse : Good morning. Phebe I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog, and just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a lot of what\u2019s happening is you\u2019ve been working off a very strong 650 bookings back in 2011. So there is distortion. Is there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries\u2019 orders, the introduction of these two new aircraft create new distortion in the next couple of quarters as these orders come in? Phebe Novakovic : So, you would aptly and correctly pointed out the, for the 650 order book. And given the length of time between order today and a delivery of that aircraft, is has some distortion in our book-to-bill. And we\u2019ve talked about that I think for the last five or six quarters. As we move into the new airplane orders, we expect something very similar. So, I think that we used to watch book-to-bill with great, in the Aerospace Group, with great, I wouldn\u2019t say consternation but detail. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s apt now. So what we watch for is the mix of the airplanes and so far our in-service models are doing very-very well. Robert Spingarn :   Okay. And then just switching topics a quick one if I could on a potential additional striker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing? Credit Suisse :   Okay. And then just switching topics a quick one if I could on a potential additional striker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing? Phebe Novakovic :  That kind of depends on when we get an appropriations bill passed. As we\u2019ve got money in 2015 appropriations for the striker bridge, the customer is very anxious to get those vehicles. So, it was pretty much inline of what we planned for in \u201915 and \u201916. But as I said we don\u2019t have our detailed plans done, but there were no surprises. Phebe Novakovic :   Okay. Thank you very much. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of John Gordon from General Dynamics. Please proceed. John Gordon :  It's John Gordon from Morgan Stanley, but thank you for taking my question. Morgan Stanley :  It's John Gordon from Morgan Stanley, but thank you for taking my question. Phebe Novakovic : So you got a battlefield promotion here. John Gordon : That is right, Phebe, I wanted to follow-up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about sort of the progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they have exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had highlighted a number of puts and takes, so when we think about your full year guidance now it seems like those aren\u2019t I guess the downside risk isn\u2019t coming to, I was hoping if you could just kind of give us a bit of color and maybe a play-by-play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015 at risks and opportunities to improve margins from here? Morgan Stanley : That is right, Phebe, I wanted to follow-up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about sort of the progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they have exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had highlighted a number of puts and takes, so when we think about your full year guidance now it seems like those aren\u2019t I guess the downside risk isn\u2019t coming to, I was hoping if you could just kind of give us a bit of color and maybe a play-by-play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015 at risks and opportunities to improve margins from here? Phebe Novakovic : So, the single largest factor particularly for this quarter in margins was pre-owned and we\u2019ve talked I think for the last couple of quarters about with a business of this level of complexity there are a lot of puts and takes, aircraft mix, the mix of service both in terms of volume and types of service, what, some service jobs come in with a lot more high content work, R&D is lumpy, G&A can be lumpy, the pre-owned in this quarter was significant and we didn\u2019t have much pre-owned in the first couple of quarters of this in fact zero in the first half of this year and we had three this quarter. So that is sort of I think well that is what affected our margins this year or this quarter. And then for the fourth quarter we\u2019re looking for a pretty much the same, unless some margin compression but not a whole lot, again we anticipate a couple of pre-owned that carry no margin with it. Going forward, we believe that we\u2019re going to see some margin expansions particularly as the 650 comes down its learning curve or not done improvement from the 650 in fact and production in fact are never really done. And then in the out years when we start to ramp-up 550 or 500 and 600 production we\u2019ll see some compression in margin as we come down our learning curves. But again nothing that is remarkable or particularly out there. John Gordon : Got it, thanks. Morgan Stanley : Got it, thanks. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Myles Walton :  Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter and then usually it's seasonally strong you just don\u2019t know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if you\u2019ll extend supplier\u2019s cash here from the events in the fourth quarter. But the real question Phebe is given the breadth of growth in the defense backlogs I mean it seems like you would in a place to I don\u2019t want to say declare a bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015 is that across the defense portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement? Deutsche Bank :  Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter and then usually it's seasonally strong you just don\u2019t know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if you\u2019ll extend supplier\u2019s cash here from the events in the fourth quarter. But the real question Phebe is given the breadth of growth in the defense backlogs I mean it seems like you would in a place to I don\u2019t want to say declare a bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015 is that across the defense portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, let me talk about growth and let\u2019s go by Groups in the Marine Group you ought to see steady low single-digit growth year-over-year and we\u2019ve been predicting that and that\u2019s in fact what has happened. Combat Systems given the considerable backlog it has when we start ramping up production and that is largely going to be in\u201916 and \u201917, and I think you\u2019re going to see good bottom-line and top-line growth. And IS&T, we believe we\u2019re at the bottom and we do at least had a good order book in this last quarter. So, we see some good potential there. So on cash conversion thus far fourth quarter will be lighter obviously because we\u2019re beginning to disperse some of that cash to our suppliers. Myles Walton : Will it be positive free cash flow? Deutsche Bank : Will it be positive free cash flow? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Myles Walton : Okay. Thanks. Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed. George Shapiro :   Yes, good morning. Phebe I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin, this quarter it was 31%. The second quarter you couldn\u2019t calculate because the margin was up on down revenues. And the first quarter was also close to 30%. So I know you\u2019ll say there is a lot of moving parts in everything in there. But it does seem like the incrementals still come out to around 30%. Now, is there any reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue as we going forward? And then also if you could just update us on what your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that\u2019s changed any from the second quarter? Shapiro Research :   Yes, good morning. Phebe I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin, this quarter it was 31%.

And then also if you could just update us on what your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that\u2019s changed any from the second quarter? Phebe Novakovic : No, we\u2019re at 116 large cabin and 32 mid cabin and that\u2019s on green deliveries. George Shapiro : Okay. Shapiro Research : Okay. Phebe Novakovic : And basically the same for completions, so, look margins are going to be, and I think you\u2019ve seen, they are somewhat lumpy. They will -- earnings are going to follow revenue growth. But we will have lumpy margins for a whole series of reasons that we\u2019ve talked about at some length. R&D will fluctuate, net R&D will fluctuate, G&A will fluctuate, mix is going to fluctuate, pre-owned. It\u2019s a complex business with a lot of moving parts that you\u2019ve got a lot of puts and takes, right. George Shapiro : Right, and that\u2019s why to me it\u2019s still surprising that when you look at the incremental margins. They don\u2019t seem to vary all that much. It seems to be up around that 30% level. Shapiro Research : Right, and that\u2019s why to me it\u2019s still surprising that when you look at the incremental margins. They don\u2019t seem to vary all that much. It seems to be up around that 30% level. Phebe Novakovic : Well, our performance continues to pay if it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve got in any given quarter there are things that are affecting it and activities that are affecting it. So we have on our gross margins on our airplanes continue to be very-very strong and we see improvement across the board, quarter-over-quarter. So, go ahead\u2026 George Shapiro : Okay, but -- one quick one maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated with the three pre-owned aircraft? Shapiro Research : Okay, but -- one quick one maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated with the three pre-owned aircraft? Jason Aiken : Yes, one second. That\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : I think it\u2019s over 100 million. Jason Aiken : Yes, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s actually closer to about 70 million, or so. George Shapiro : Okay, thanks very much Phebe and good performance. Shapiro Research : Okay, thanks very much Phebe and good performance. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed. Pete Skibitski : Good morning guys, nice quarter. And Phebe I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what\u2019s going on with Russia and China with the sanction, but I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues particularly the sanctions holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what\u2019s going on in those regions? Drexel Hamilton : Good morning guys, nice quarter. And Phebe I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what\u2019s going on with Russia and China with the sanction, but I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues particularly the sanctions holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what\u2019s going on in those regions? Phebe Novakovic : Not yet. The sanctions have only impacted us at very-very far margin, and more at Jet Aviation than in Gulfstream. And China, China has a history of variability in its order activity. So, I don\u2019t see anything abnormal there. Pete Skibitski : Okay, got it. And then just you touched on pre-owned market a little bit. Can you talk about the pricing that pre-owned market maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year, not really improving? Or can you shed some color there? Drexel Hamilton : Okay, got it. And then just you touched on pre-owned market a little bit. Can you talk about the pricing that pre-owned market maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year, not really improving? Or can you shed some color there? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, it\u2019s stable. And we\u2019re seeing some improvements, particularly in the larger cabins. Price is affirming up in the pre-owned. Pete Skibitski : Thank you. Drexel Hamilton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Phebe it seems as if you\u2019re continuing to go through the businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you\u2019ve done one in Combat and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that you\u2019re looking for, for each of the businesses? I mean, you\u2019ve sort hinted at some of them and in the earlier questions. Could you provide a little granularity please? Jefferies: Thank you very much. Phebe it seems as if you\u2019re continuing to go through the businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you\u2019ve done one in Combat and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that you\u2019re looking for, for each of the businesses? I mean, you\u2019ve sort hinted at some of them and in the earlier questions. Could you provide a little granularity please? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, in the case of Combat Systems, and by the way all of our internal reorganizations have been in response to changes in our market. So, as we looked at last year, our ATP and OTS business, it made eminent sense to go ahead and combine those two. Primarily some for scale but primarily to our cost reduction and that has executed beautifully. So, we\u2019ve got nice-nice margin activity at now the new OTS. The IS&T was something we\u2019ve thought about for a while. But again as our markets have contracted, it made sense now to integrate those two businesses primarily again for cost reductions. And we ought to see that, the margin benefit from that starting next year and going into the future. But also it provides us some scale which is helpful too in this down market. Look what we want to do in the down market is manage what you can manage and keep our margins as high as possible. So, we\u2019ve had a long road of recovery on IS&T margins, but I anticipate that they will continue to improve. Howard Rubel : And then just I don\u2019t know, you said the other thing that you\u2019ve done is you currently took work in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you\u2019ve done there to sort of take productivity and to a new level and what does that sort of imply for, what you are sort of setting a standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options? Jefferies: And then just I don\u2019t know, you said the other thing that you\u2019ve done is you currently took work in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes, could you just elaborate a little bit more on what you\u2019ve done there to sort of take productivity and to a new level and what does that sort of imply for, what you are sort of setting a standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options? Phebe Novakovic : Well, it\u2019s an interesting question now let\u2019s go to the, what we have done in anticipation of the new airplane. We learned a very important lesson with the 650 that a purpose build facility provides much greater margin expansion overtime, that plus the way these airplanes were designed if they were designed for producibility. So fewer parts and cleaner and clear build paper, work paper that get\u2019s out on the shop floor, so given that we have these purpose build facilities and the way these planes were manufactured or designed, I think we\u2019ve got very-very good earnings potential in the future. We\u2019ve taken some work in-house that we previously had outsourced so largely just as a matter of control and efficiency for some of these parts that we are now manufacturing at Gulfstream, the transportation costs are significantly less when you move it from one building right over to the next building. So that was a factor and how we thought about optimizing earnings potential going forward for these new airplanes. I don\u2019t believe that this is necessarily a model for the defense businesses, not something that they look at. The Marine Group is not a vertically integrated Group neither is our Land Systems. So they have a very robust and disciplined supply chain network and I don\u2019t see them bringing more work in-house. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much.  Jefferies: Thank you very much. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed. David Strauss :  Good morning. Phebe where are you in the process of selling AxleTech? UBS:  Good morning. Phebe where are you in the process of selling AxleTech? Phebe Novakovic : As you know we moved AxleTech into discontinued operations and we are selling at and I think it\u2019s not appropriate to comment any further than that. David Strauss : Okay. As a follow-up Jason, on the pension legislation half the legislation I know you guys deal with cash differently than everyone else, but how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint going forward does that help you? UBS: Okay. As a follow-up Jason, on the pension legislation half the legislation I know you guys deal with cash differently than everyone else, but how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint going forward does that help you? Jason Aiken :  It does, I think like just about everybody else it brings down pretty meaningfully the mandatory contributions that we\u2019re projecting. That said, I think as you are aware of those contributions that we had in the past and are forecasting aren\u2019t necessarily potentially as significant to us as it maybe to others. So the reduction isn\u2019t something that we material, focused on as a material item that will change our cash flow outlook or anything else like that in a significant way. David Strauss : Okay, great. Thank you.  UBS: Okay, great. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic :  Tihisha, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : : Carter Copeland :  Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Erin and good quarter. Just a couple of quick clarifications, Jason you said that the contribution from Jet was good in the quarter, I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you have seen in maybe the past couple of quarters? And then with respect to the Mission Systems\u2019 creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year and if you could help us think about what that might contribute to next year\u2019s margin? Thank you very much. Barclays Capital :  Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Erin and good quarter. Just a couple of quick clarifications, Jason you said that the contribution from Jet was good in the quarter, I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you have seen in maybe the past couple of quarters? And then with respect to the Mission Systems\u2019 creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year and if you could help us think about what that might contribute to next year\u2019s margin? Thank you very much. Jason Aiken : I think with respect to the Jet Aviation question, we continue to see steady improvement in the business and year-over-year each quarter we\u2019re seeing improvement, second quarter to second, third quarter to third and so on. So we expect to continue to see that slowly and steadily improve in our operations. Phebe Novakovic : Any charges with respect to restructuring will be taken in the quarter in which they are incurred and more than offset by the cost saving. So we don\u2019t see any material headwinds as a result. Carter Copeland : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Barclays Capital : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Erin Linnihan :  Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Shantelay and I will be your facilitator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed. Erin Linnihan : Thank you Shantelay and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Erin. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.19 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.36 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $737 million. It was our strongest revenue performance in the past 12 quarters, the highest operating earnings ever and the highest earnings from continuing operations. For the year we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.83 on revenue of $30.85 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.7 billion, a return on sales of 8.7%. It was a year of solid achievement from both an operating perspective and the development of significant backlog. As you can see from schedule H to the press release, funded backlog grew from $38.3 billion at year end 2013 to $52.9 billion at the end of last year. The story for total backlog is much the same. We were at $45.9 billion at the end of 2013 and sit at $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. As a result, we are well positioned for growth in 2016 and 2017. Free cash flow from operations was a negative $254 million in the quarter. However for the year we had free cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion or 123% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2013 by 532 million. Let me give you some detail on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, aerospace. Revenue and earnings were up nicely over the year ago quarter. Sales were up 105 million, 4.9% and earnings were up 64 million, a significant 18.4% on very strong margin improvement. This is particularly impressive when one considers that G&A and net R&D were up $40 million over the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, sales were up $49 million but earnings were up 1 million on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins. I should add that Jet remained nicely profitable in the quarter with a better contribution on both a year ago and sequential comparison basis.  The order activity in the quarter was robust as one would expect with the announcement of two new aircraft. As you can observe, on Exhibit H, funded backlog \u2013 total backlog and total potential contract value, including options are all up significantly. Even if we were to ignore the orders related to the two new aircraft, total orders from current production aircraft were the highest of the year. All large cabin aircraft had a dollar based book to bill greater than 1 to 1.  For the year, revenues were 8.65 billion in operating earnings or 1.61 billion on an operating margin of 18.6%. This is a year over year improvement of 6.5% on sales, 13.8% on earnings and 120 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at aerospace with strong operating leverage.  At combat systems, sales were up 23 million or 1.4% and earnings were up 21 million or 8.4%, on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin over the year ago quarter. Sequentially the story is similar. Sales were up 219 million and earnings were up 39 million. For the year sales were down 100 million or 1.7% and earnings were down 46 million or 5.1%. This compares quite favourably to the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we guided to a 4 to 4.5. Revenue declined as opposed to the 1.7% decline that occurred.  We also guided the operating margins of 14% which we beat by 100 basis points. Overall combat systems is a story of solid additions to backlog, better than anticipated revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. This is a business group that has clearly stabilized.  Margin group revenue in the quarter exceeded $2 billion for the first time ever. Operating earnings of 193 million were the second highest ever recorded. Revenue was up 410 million or 25.2% compared to the year ago quarter and up 220 million or 12.1% sequentially.  Revenues for the year were up 600 million, almost 9%, very nice growth. Operating earnings were up 34 million or 21.4% against the year ago quarter and up 23 million or 13.5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up 37 million or 5.6% on a 30 basis point decline in operating margins, attributable to mix shift which was consistent with our guidance to you. In the marine group, we guided you at this time last year to a revenue increase of 2.5% which we obviously exceeded. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.6%, all in all a very good year for the marine group.  IS&T is a business group where we saw less than expected revenue decline and improved operating performance. Revenue in the quarter was 2.47 billion, down 223 million or 8.3% against the year ago quarter. Revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down 1.1 billion or 10.8% for the year. Remember that this is dramatically less than the 20% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year.  Operating earnings of 212 million in the quarter were 8.2% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up 10 million or 5%. For the year, earnings were down only 10 million or 1.3%, which is very good performance in the face of a 10.8% revenue decline. On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in the 8.2% range which we beat by 40 basis points. All in all, we beat forecasted revenue by $1 billion and operating margins by 40 basis points. When that happens, the result is a very pleasant upside surprise.  So company wide, on this call a year ago, our guidance for 2014 was to expect revenues of 30 billion, operating margin rate of 12%, a tax rate of 31% and the return on sales of 8%. We wound up the year with revenues of 30.85 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.6%, an effective tax rate of 29.7% and a return on sales of 8.7%.  We provided EPS guidance of $6.80 to $6.85. We wound up at $7.83. About $0.62 of the improvement came from better than planned operating performance, $0.13 from slightly lower than planned tax rate and the balance from share count as a result of share repurchases.  So let me provide you some thoughts about 2015, initially by business group and then on a company wide roll-up. In aerospace, we expect revenues to be approximately 9.4 billion, up about 8.3%. Margin rate should be approximately 18%, somewhat down from 2014 attributable in part to less favorability at Jet. Nonetheless up about 4.5% in earnings.  In combat systems, we expect both revenue and earnings to be essentially flat with growth resuming in 2016 and beyond. The marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very modest improvement to operating earnings.  Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of about 5.5% but improved margin rate of slightly more than 9%. This will result in improved operating earnings year over year. We expect the last year to be our low watermark for revenue. In part, we are seeing some of the decline we anticipated last year being delayed into this year. Once again we should see revenue growth in 2016 and 2017.  All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12.8% and a return on sales of roughly 8.7%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 30.5% tax rate, assumes we buy enough shares to hold the share count steady with year end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year\u2019s guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 at the same time on the same basis.  So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from out-performing the operating plan and the effect of share repurchases.  So how should one think about the quarterly progression of EPS? Whatever your model is for the year, divide by 4. And the first and the second quarters will be light by about $0.10, the third quarter about right on and the fourth quarter about $0.20 better. By the way, quarterly progression is notoriously difficult. With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2015 for dividends and share repurchases. While we don\u2019t anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective, in light of the advance payments on international orders that we have received last year, we intend to treat the free cash available for dividends and share repurchases on some normalized basis. In short, we will use balance sheet as necessary to normalize the year.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will take just a minute and cover a few miscellaneous financial items before the question and answer period.  Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for the year interest expense was $86 million, consistent with the year before. For 2015, we expect net interest expense of around $82 million, a decline from 2014 resulting from the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that matured last week. At the end of the year, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $477 million. This was down by about $1 billion from the end of 2013, reflecting the cash we used from the balance sheet for capital deployment activities which I will address in just a minute.  Our effective tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter and 29.7% for the year, and that\u2019s a bit lower than we had been forecasting. As you will recall our most recent projections were in the neighborhood of 30% to 30.5%. Lower outcome is attributable to the R&D tax credit extension in late December. For 2015, as Phebe mentioned, we expect an effective tax rate of around 30.5%.  And finally, on the income statement, you will notice we took a charge in the quarter in discontinued operations. This is related to the sale of our AxleTech business which we first reported in the second quarter when we made the decision to sell that business. The charge we took at the time was predicated on the 2014 closing of the sale. The regulatory review process for the transaction delayed the closing until the 5th of January and as a result we were not able to take advantage of some tax benefits we\u2019d anticipated. So we adjusted the loss on the sale in the fourth quarter. Switching gears, we contributed $515 million to our pension plan in 2014 and for 2015 we expect that amount to decline to approximately $185 million as a result of the interest rate relief from the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014.  On the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year. We delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In total we expended approximately $3.4 billion on share repurchases in 2014 and when you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $4.2 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2014 or 1.3 times our free cash flow from operations for the year. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I will turn the time back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan : Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Shantelay, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. David Strauss : Phebe, could you give us a little bit more detail on the free cash flow outlook? It sounds like it\u2019s going to be lower. Could you maybe peg it as a percent of net income in 2015 and what exactly \u2013 how much of that is in advance drawdown in terms of the pressure on free cash flow? Phebe Novakovic : So we tend not to give you specifics as a percentage of net income on our free cash flow. But suffice it to say it\u2019s going to be less robust as a result of our drawdown in our deposits. But we will intend to normalize our free cash flow using our cash on the balance sheet to effect any capital deployment. I think that\u2019s about as much color as we yearly give you and as much as we are prepared to give you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ron Epstein : Just a quick question for you on Gulfstream. How do you expect I guess the sales profile for the business to go when you are leading into the ramp up of the new models, right, so maybe a better way to say, the transition between kind of the old models and the new models, would you expect the profile of the business to continue to grow? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. We do expect the profile to continue to grow in the near years, but at less of a rate than it will grow when we introduced an entry into service of the new airplane. So we have growth between now and entry into service of the G500 and we\u2019d expect accelerated growth going forward from there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : Hi. Wanted to talk a little bit about marine and the strength you talked about there, your very strong fourth quarter and how things do trend as we go through \u201915 especially on some of the development work you\u2019re doing on upcoming programs? Phebe Novakovic : Okay. 2014 growth was driven by higher than expected volume on Block IV electric boat, more unplanned repair work in addition of commercial volume, and we anticipate that those growth elements to continue into next year albeit at a less of a rate of increase. Our developmental work primarily on Ohio replacement ballistic missile submarine continues at pace for the sole source on that, on track and we\u2019re year over year increasing work on that contract. And it\u2019s going very well. So we like where we are positioned there. Robert Spingarn : And what you said, the fourth quarter itself \u2013 you said, I think the strongest quarterly revenues you\u2019ve seen, how do we think about just the timing there? Phebe Novakovic : Well we have continued to see growth this year at about 2% to 2.5%, which is, I think, very good in this environment, and that growth will continue into the outyears as we get more volume on Block IV \u2013 now we continue to do additional work on our commercial volume, repair work fluctuates but has year over year been growing and we began work on the fourth MLP. So we\u2019ve got growth engines for marine group. We did obviously last year, we do into this year, and we do in the future. We have been telling a growth story for the last two years at marine group and you saw it manifest itself in 2014. It\u2019s going to continue to 2015 and into the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, so I guess I am a little confused at GulfStream, if your sales go up to 9.4, a nice sales gain, and we\u2019re getting improving profitability on the 650, why are the margins down? I mean Jet just isn\u2019t that big a part of the business and what\u2019s \u2013 maybe give us a little more color on the delivery mix if you could? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So we have a slightly \u2013 so there are couple of things that are compressing margins slightly in 2015. We have a slightly unfavorable mix shift in green production between large cabin and mid cabin. We are keeping large cabin production about the same rate as we did last year, at about 115 units. We are increasing mid-cabin by 10 units. And so there is a somewhat unfavorable mix shift between large and mid-sized green. It\u2019s got less of a contribution at Jet primarily and exclusively driven by mix shift. We\u2019ve got higher R&D in this upcoming year. Remember that we are building multiple test aircraft to carry with them no revenue and earnings.  And in the final \u2013 the final issue that\u2019s impacting margins somewhat in 2015 is we have higher pre-owned. So those are the four components that are driving the margin variability. Cai von Rumohr : But the R&D, I mean, is that up as a percent of sales because -- is the G650 still improving in profitability or is the profitability declining on the 450 and 550? Phebe Novakovic : No, so that\u2019s a kind of two-part question. Net R&D is up slightly. The 650 profitability continues to increase. And the 450 and 550 profitability being exactly where it has been, we have a greater mix shift this year \u2013 of mid-cabin which carries with it lower earnings \u2013 lower margins. I think you need to think about it that way. We\u2019ve talked before about the variability of margins at GulfStream, and this is an example of it. There\u2019s nothing unexpected from our point of view. There is nothing systemic. It\u2019s just simply the ebb and flow of production, R&D and pre-owned. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Myles Walton : You mentioned that all of the large cabin programs had book to bill above 1. And the question is really two fold. One is where are the demands you are seeing the biggest part of the strength and whether you are seeing any dilution of strength in the oil-rich countries or Russia in particular? And the other piece of it is, is 2015 a year where you are delivering more G650s than the 450 and 550s in the mix? Phebe Novakovic : So let me talk a little bit about demand and give you a little bit of color there. The demand for our in product \u2013 in production airplanes was quite handsome for the last quarter. The 650 and 280s increased, and interestingly but not surprisingly, when we got inside the demand curve for the 650 inside the 3-year delivery window, Q4 orders were particularly strong. 280 was again strong. The 450 and 550 demand has slowed slightly; it\u2019s okay. Not super heated but good enough. And we continue to see strong demand primarily in North America and somewhat in Asia and also in the Mid-East. Heretofore we have seen no impact on oil prices on our backlog, or frankly in our demand. If you are asking what percentage of our backlog may have some exposure to energy related or have some energy related exposures, it\u2019s about 5% but we haven\u2019t seen any impact yet. I would add, we are seeing historically low operating cost which is -- usually drive increased flight hours, and that\u2019s a potential upside for our service business. So we tend not to give you delivery with any more specificity than we already have with respect to models, when you break it up by large cabin and mid cabin. And I don\u2019t intend to change that in a moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Doug Harned : Hi, I wanted to just follow up on that. On the G450 \u2013 excuse me, on the G550, when you look forward here, where are you today in terms of months of backlog, something that you\u2019ve given us in the past, and how are you thinking about pricing as you approach the G500 and G600 coming into operation? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So I think you know that we don\u2019t talk about pricing, that\u2019s competitively sensitive. But let me give you a sense of where we are and first available. In general, for new customers, for the G650 and G650ER first available is fourth quarter 2017, that moved to the right a quarter from third quarter of last year as a result of our good order activity. The G550 is about 12 months out, the G450 late this year, so that moved a couple of months \u2013 a few months into the left. The G280 is also available \u2013 first available late this year and not that anybody asked, but the G150 is first quarter 2016. So it\u2019s important to recall that deals are often in the works that move customers around in the backlog for earlier squad [ph] but the above is about approximate window for new buyers. So I hope that helps you. Doug Harned : And you can\u2019t really comment on the trajectory on pricing with the model change I guess, is that \u2013 Phebe Novakovic : No, look, we have continued to hold price on products and you could expect that over time there is some price variability but we are not about to get into any specifics. That\u2019s just not good a competitive place to be in a highly competitive market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Robert Stallard : Phebe, on IS&T you\u2019ve guided down 5.5% for this year. Can you give us an idea of how much of that is already in the backlog and sort of level of conservatism you might have based into that given the fluctuating situation with the DoD budget? Phebe Novakovic : Given the what situation? Robert Stallard : Fluctuating? Phebe Novakovic : So we have about three quarters of our guidance for IS&T in our backlog. That\u2019s exactly where we have been historically including recently. We\u2019ve got good \u2013 we\u2019ve got a high level of RFP \u2013 request for proposal activity and are bidding on a number of contracts. So we are pretty comfortable that we can hit our revenue guidance. And from our point of view, we\u2019ve seen less fluctuation in the DoD budget with respect to our IS&T units recently than we had a couple of years ago. So we think that, that\u2019s somewhat stabilized and as I told you, we anticipated 2014 would be our low watermark \u2013 it was better than we thought it was going to be, and I think some of that decrease bled into 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Sam Pearlstein : Hi. Can you talk I guess \u2013 I am going to try and put two things in there \u2013 but first on marine, I am somewhat that you are not seeing more margin pressure given what I would think would be more Bloc IV work and more Ohio replacement work in the year just in terms of the mix, so I guess what are you doing to offset that? And then just related to combat, you talked about growth resuming in 2016. Is this a business that we should now expect to see kind of growth in this still 15% kind of margin runway far into the future? Phebe Novakovic : Let me address your questions in the order that they were asked. We\u2019ve talked frequently about margin variability at the marine group. There is really a mix shift and you quite accurately point out that we are experiencing a mix shift really frankly across our portfolio, more Block IV, less Block III, more commercial work coming off of the MLP program and first of class ships on the DDG1000 and DDG51 restart. That said, these businesses have continued to perform very very well on cost cutting, efficiency and their performance have been quite good, and I frankly expect to see margin expansion which is primarily driven by Block IV, we have increased margin potential and earnings potential from our profitability and efficiency as we move down our learning curve. So marine group continues to function very very well and I like their growth story.  Combat systems growth, we have that significant backlog and now for us it\u2019s all a question of performing on that backlog and I think this group has demonstrated its operational excellence and will continue to do so. So I expect \u2013 I have given you my guidance for 2015 but as I project out into the future and think about the business, it\u2019s just going to be \u2013 we are going to see some growth in combat and I would expect to fully anticipate given the operational excellence of this group to see margin expansion but I am not going to bake any of that in now, on some of these programs. We are still in fairly new starts and low rate production but everything we see, this is a group that will continue to cut costs and improve its efficiency. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Phebe, can you talk a little bit about the variables that drive the decision to take up rate, as you look here across the global landscape, questions about global economic growth possibly decelerating particularly in emerging markets, a very strong US dollar right now that might be having an impact on some of your operating expenses. And sort of as that filters into potential cannibalization within the product lines, more of a G650 question anything else, but can you talk about maybe at a higher level for what factors you guys look at when deciding how to think about taking up production rates? Phebe Novakovic : So we have historically and as we talked about before, we\u2019ve historically set our production rates and we\u2019ve continued that practice based on what we see in demand, and to optimize around our economic efficiency, our supplier base and we\u2019ve been very judicious year over year in setting our production rates and deliveries. So as I mentioned, we continue to see a very strong demand, particularly for the 650 \u2013 as our pipeline on the 650 is very good, the 280 also. So we really haven\u2019t seen much impact on emerging markets, certainly not this year. North America remains very strong with us, Asia Pacific and we are also seeing some increased demand in the Middle East. I would also tell you that about 60% of our backlog is with public and private companies including Fortune 500, they may tend to be very stable and reliable and predictable. And as I said our pipeline continues to show interest on their part. So I hope that kind of addressed it, if you look at a complex number of factors, what our demand is, what our goals are for our operating efficiency, our supply chain, we manage prudently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne, Agee. Peter Arment : Phebe, quick question on just the international demand, I know you gave us some good color on GulfStream\u2019s impact, particularly tied to the energy end markets. You won a lot of orders in terms of combat this past year. How are we thinking about the international demand first under the defense business, I think that you have, and any risk tied to see some of the lower price of oil on that? Phebe Novakovic : The lower price of oil. I have been a big believer and I think history has demonstrated that demand for defense products is driven by threat and perceived threat, and you just have to open up the paper to see that the world isn\u2019t increasingly unsafe place. So we see it in increased level of interest in parts of Europe and the Middle East, just as you might anticipate. Governments begin to rethink their spending priorities in light of some of the threats that they see both actualized and potential. So we have a pretty robust pipeline that\u2019s continuing, in our IS&T unit and for combat now, I will tell you that the marine group has almost no and never had much international exposure. Just the nature of our Navy shipbuilding program. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : I want to pursue the margin at GulfStream a little bit more. This quarter effectively you had 60% incrementals and if I add back the 40 million higher R&D and G&A, you would have had a 100% conversion. So can you tell me what was so strong this quarter that all of next year\u2019s probably going to decline if your numbers are right to 15% kind of incremental margins? And also, you had no pre-owned this quarter, you had three for the year versus 11 in \u201913. So why does \u201815 pre-owned go up? Phebe Novakovic : Well, that\u2019s a compound question, George. So let me see if I can at least address what I think the essence is. The same, having less pre-owned this year clearly wasn\u2019t upper to our margins. Pre-owned tends to carry no revenue. And we forecast pre-owned demand based on what we see in our backlog and sometimes that comes to fruition and sometimes not. So this has been a pretty sustained pattern over time with respect to pre-owned, it tends to be lumpy and we won\u2019t know until the quarter of execution whether in fact anticipated pre-owneds come into our market or they are sold before they get to GulfStream. So that makes pre-owned a little bit tougher to articulate. We had the performance at GulfStream this year was extremely strong and we had a favorable completion mix in the fourth quarter that we are reversing somewhat going into next year. So we\u2019ve talked multiple times about the fallacy of being able to predict with great specificity the GulfStream or aerospace margins and I will tell you Jet had a very strong year this year. And that contribution will be less next year primarily driven by a mix shift as they move into the additional completion work and they come down their learning curve. So all of these factors are planned at GulfStream and aerospace margins. George Shapiro : Could you point to some unique things in the fourth quarter that caused such an extraordinarily high conversion that won\u2019t repeat? Phebe Novakovic : Well I think again gosh, George, I have tried, we\u2019ve got less contribution from Jet and we had a favorable delivery mix on large cabin to mid cab and that\u2019s a pretty \u2013 those are pretty big movers. So \u2013 and less pre-owned and that\u2019s a big one. Pre-owned tends to carry very little with no or negative margins. So that in my mind explains. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Howard Rubel : Rather than be too granular here, I wanted to take a step back. As you look at your outlook and what you\u2019ve asked your senior executives to do, where \u2013 as you look at the various risks might you see either challenges or opportunities and I use two examples and then hopefully you can add to that. One is some of your operations have European or Canadian based costs and you sell in dollars, so there may be some upside there, although I know you had some. And then also you embarked on a very aggressive research and development campaign at GulfStream and how have you assessed the risks and where have you felt like you\u2019ve made progress? So it\u2019s a bit of specifics and then wrapped in a little bit of the 805 to 810 is a nice start for the year but I am sure we won\u2019t end there. Phebe Novakovic : So just to reiterate, we have given you guidance based on the same assumptions that we used last year, and our ability to do better is simply going to be as a result of share repurchases and outperforming our plan. If you look at our outlook, it\u2019s informed by the last two years, where we focused on operations, reduced our costs and results, built our backlog. So we are poised for growth as a result of that backlog for several years to come. It\u2019s a very nice position to be. We are going to see some good growth in \u201916 and \u201917 and the business is poised for that. We\u2019ve been focusing on operations and what we basically call the back to basic which is blocking and tackling. That work is never done. So we\u2019re going to continue to attack our costs through a relentless focus on our cost performance and re-engineering our business, that will make us more competitive, reduces our cost mix, more competitive and that two will help growth. So we have positioned ourselves nicely and I think we will continue to do so going forward.  Our opportunities are because of our improved competitiveness, increased growth primarily both overseas and we\u2019ve talked about that before. We\u2019ve got another opportunity as margin expansion going forward as we focus on our continuous improvement. We\u2019ve got \u2013 when I think about risks, you implicitly asked about foreign currency risk. We are less exposed to foreign currency variability than companies in other sectors for example and 60% of our business is with the US government and GulfStream\u2019s exposures to the US economy. We have \u2013 there\u2019s some translation difficulty year over year with respect to currency fluctuations, we\u2019ve embedded those in our plan. We also have some nice natural hedges both in Europe and in Canada. So has the strong dollar affected any of our demand? Not really. And we certainly haven\u2019t seen it in our backlog. We had a translation we had to adjust our combat backlog as a result of a negative translation but that\u2019s on work, that\u2019s many years out. So but in terms of sales, we are not just seeing any particular impact. It\u2019s a potential sure but not affecting us.  So \u2013 oh, you asked about R&D as a risk. So the key, when you introduce I think you invest in a business and a new product development. And you introduce new product, is that you have managed that R&D and the engineering and development and design effectively, and GulfStream has a proven history of doing that and we are continuing to see that same kind of excellent execution in our design and engineering effort at GulfStream. So we don\u2019t see any risk outside what we have always seen in the past with respect to R&D but we manage R&D at GulfStream and their design and engineering activities very very closely and we\u2019ve really \u2013 we set the expectations accordingly and we\u2019ve got a great team there. It\u2019s all about the execution and so far so good. So I hope that answers where you were ahead. Howard Rubel : No, I actually meant the currency because of where you are building things is actually an advantage either in Europe or in Canada, that was a \u2013 Phebe Novakovic : Yes, in some instances, it is but we haven\u2019t seen either up, nor down any particular impact in the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Joe Nadol : So I have a couple but they are easy. One, once more, just on the clarification, on the combat side, you are seeing flat, you had these big orders obviously in your backlog that were from international customers last year. Can you give us some help with how much you expect international if it\u2019s a case to be up and then US down in 2015? And the second one is just more broadly speaking, looking at the whole company, can you speak a little bit, whatever you feel comfortable, about the bookings that you are expecting across the company this year? I am particularly interested is, are there any of these larger combat opportunities that are still out there that might hit kind of $1 billion plus opportunities? And then also particularly interested in the 500 and 600 and what the tempo you expect on bookings there might be? Phebe Novakovic : Okay. Complex questions. But let me address them in the order in which you asked them. We are seeing stabilization in our US land forces exposure at combat systems, directly in line with our expectations. And so we don\u2019t really see any at least surprises that we can see in the near term. International orders are or international sales this year are comprised about in excess of 55% of combat sales, and we will increase to 60 over time not at the expense of our domestic activity but just as a revenue expansion. So we do \u2013 we still have a lot of I\u2019d say number of international orders in our pipeline that are of decent size, that is our \u2013 it is our expectation that given our competitiveness in our cost structure we are going to be having some competitive in the competition. So we have additional upside in building our backlog at combat but I am not prepared to give you any specifics on whether that makes it a book to bill of 1 to 1 in any one given year, that will depend on a lot of things on when these competitions are decided but we\u2019ve got a lot of proposal activity out there. And with respect to 550 or 500 and 600 tempo, both of those R&D programs are proceeding at pace, and no major changes since the last time we talked to about it. Our pipeline is very robust and I expect sales to increase as we orders to increase as we get closer and closer to the entry into service as a 500 and then the 600. So there is no \u2013 there have been no stumbling blocks heretofore and our profiles on R&D and production of the test airplanes remain right on plan. So we are very pleased with that and we are pleased with the interest that both of these models have generated. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Jason Gursky : Similar to Joe, one clarification question and then one, on the growth for combat systems out into \u201916 and \u201917, can you offer a little bit of more insight on the type of growth that you might be expecting there? And then if you wouldn\u2019t mind, just driving down into IS&T, where are you seeing relative areas of strength in \u201915 and weakness in \u201915, just what\u2019s the mix doing there? Phebe Novakovic : I don\u2019t want to get into specifics about \u201916 and \u201917 other than we are \u2013 at combat, other than we have the backlog and are poised for reasonable growth, growth that we will manage according to our terms and conditions of our contract and also our supply chain. So I would expect growth but not of a double digit nature. We don\u2019t think it that way. We are not going to burn off that backlog that quickly. It\u2019s not efficient and it\u2019s not in accordance with the terms and conditions of our contracts. The second part of your question \u2013 Jason Gursky : The mix at IS&T where you\u2019re seeing \u2013 Phebe Novakovic : Mix in IS&T. So we have \u2013 as you know, over the last few years, our IT services business has composed a larger percentage of our revenues, that is somewhat changing as a percent of revenue. We, you may know, combined two of our non-IT businesses and AIS and C4 systems into mission systems. And over time there it is our anticipation that they will grow as a larger percentage of our IS&T sales than IT. But both of those businesses are poised very very well for \u2013 again no single digit growth but still growth and I would add that I am very pleased with their margin performance. It\u2019s particularly interesting that\u2019s a year that we had some revenue decline, considerable revenue decline, we outperformed on margins and this year we expect revenue decline and again higher margins and this time bring it with higher earnings than last year. So that\u2019s a pretty wholesome story from my perspective. Jason Gursky : Phebe, on that, just point of clarification, do you anticipate then at the end of 2015 to be kind of in a flat revenue environment year over year or creeping into a positive territory on IS&T? Phebe Novakovic : We are projecting a positive territory, positive growth. In fact, with every single one of our businesses. Operator : Question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Carter Copeland : Just I will stick to one and I want to switch gears and go back to the cash flow and capital deployment discussion. And the question is, is there an upper bound to how much balance sheet you might use to normalize your free cash flow deployment, should we think of this as whatever the gap to 100% conversion is, is what you use in the balance sheet or could it be more extensive than that? Phebe Novakovic : Every year we provided the same kind of guidance with respect to capital deployment and that is that, we at least in the two years and again this year, have anticipated deploying all of our free cash flow in share repurchases and dividends and we anticipate doing that again this year. But as with every other year, we give you the overall strategy and then the execution \u2013 the tactical execution comes during the course of the year. So think about in general terms that we will use our balance sheet to \u2013 and you quite I think accurately put it, normalize our cash flow for share repurchases. But I see no fundamental reason or a benefit from tapping into our balance sheet beyond that for share repurchases. Some of you have requested that we just \u2013 not necessarily you all but some out in the environment had requested that we go into our balance sheet early on and buy a significant number of shares. And I argued them and I will continue to argue now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s judicious nor prudent, and I think that this year is a perfect example of why you don\u2019t want to have expended all your bullets in prior years. Think about us as telling you what we are going to do at the beginning of the year and doing it and having very very reliable results and execution of our capital deployment in the year. So this year outlook very similar with respect to what our capital deployment intent is. Free cash flow and little bit or and some of the balance sheet depending again on where we are on free cash flow. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Joe DeNardi : Phebe, maybe another one on the balance sheet, I appreciate your comments about not wanting to expend all of your bullets. But maybe longer term once the defense budget environment were to improve, would that change the way that you thought about using your balance sheet relative to some of your peers? Phebe Novakovic : The way I think about the balance sheet is we have a strong balance sheet that gives us flexibility and agility and opportunity both in the year of execution and going forward. And I intend to preserve that flexibility and I intend to preserve the strength of that balance sheet with some variability in any given year, but not taken up cash off that balance sheet to change our overall firepower. So as I sit here today, that is our strategy and we will adapt accordingly in the future as circumstances may change. Joe DeNardi : And then in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, the big fourth quarter, is there any particular segment that\u2019s especially lumpy, are you waiting for any big awards to come in later in the year to hit that guidance? Phebe Novakovic : No. The quarterly distribution of EPS that I gave you in my remarks is typical of our performance that we tend to start out light, build throughout the year and have a strong fourth quarter. So that\u2019s very consistent with that ebb and flow of our business.  End of Q&A Erin Linnihan : Well, thank you all for joining our call today.

My name is Emma, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen - only mode. We will conduct a question - and - answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Emma and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics\u2019 first quarter conference call. As always, any forward - looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Erin. Earlier today we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over a billion and net earnings of $716 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.20 and were well ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We were also better than our previous guidance and our own expectations. I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of 29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance. Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later. I should further note that the diluted weighted average share count was 334 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million, so none of the outperformance comes from a lower than expected share count. I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks. All in all, this is a truly strong quarter from an operating perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%. It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had 745 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 98 million, we had 647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net income. The general comparisons quarter - over - quarter are pretty compelling compared to the first quarter 2014, revenue was up 519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable. Our operating earnings were slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year\u2019s quarter leading to a 120 basis points improvement in margins. A very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating earnings, primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate. Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings , lower tax rate and lower share count. Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First Aerospace, sales are down by 17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1% and down 132 million sequentially against the strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year ago quarter by 27 million, about 6.7% on a 140 basis points expansion in operating margins. Operating earnings were also up 19 million sequentially. The 20.4 operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing. A word of caution here, we are out of the gate fast but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. Orders were not overly strong in the quarter but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2024. It was a quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong quarter. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter 2014 following the strong fourth quarter at 2013. We\u2019re off to a very good start in the Aerospace group. Marine Systems, revenue of 1.94 billion was up 342 million or 21.4% compared to the year ago quarter and down 97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up 22 million or 13.3% against the year ago quarter and down 5 million sequentially. We have particularly good performance at Electric Boat in NASSCO. Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, sales were up 105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up 65 million or 46.8% on a 400 basis points improvement in operating margins. Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a 29 million restructuring charge at European Land Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations which were consolidated in Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in this year\u2019s operating margins is a significant 160 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was down 251 million and operating earnings are down 67 million as anticipated in the business to always have a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract delivery. All up, continued strong performance at Combat Systems. It\u2019s been a long times since we\u2019ve been able to report an increase in revenue in this group. IS&T, the big upside surprise incurred this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue decline of 5.5% year - over - year, well that certainly did not happen in the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was up 89 million or 3.9% against the year ago quarter and off only 98 million against the powerful fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings of 217 million were 34 million more than a year ago quarter, up 18.6% on a 120 basis points improvements in margins. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up 5 million on a 60 basis points improvement in margins once again nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins was the best that this group has achieved in a while and is very encouraging. The trend is in the right direction. So we\u2019re off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice and has been for three years to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Sufficed to say that we are ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance is based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and continue to outperform. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I want to start with the subject that we haven\u2019t talked about a lot in the past and that\u2019s foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the dollar we\u2019re seeing an impact in our reported results. Now to be clear this doesn\u2019t involve any economic gain or loss in any of our contracts, what I\u2019m referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local currencies to US dollars for reporting purposes. Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in our revenues and earnings over the first quarter of 2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our US dollar reported revenues and operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately 120 million and $20 million respectively compared with the exchange rate that prevailed in the first quarter of last year. In addition, our backlog was reduced by 450 million from year end due to the same translation issue. Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year end and our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported. Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement, net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed rates notes with proceeds from marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $1 billion essentially unchanged from year end. As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast and a bit lower than analyst consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago and the primary driver was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter. For the year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate in the ballpark of 29.5%. On the capital deployment front you may recall that in the first quarter of last year we repurchased to a little over 14 million shares including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares the result of almost 20 million additional shares repurchased in the past four quarters and that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of this year. Altogether, we spent $826 million on share repurchases we spent 826 million on share repurchases during the first quarter or 1.3 times of free cash flow from operations. Erin that concludes my remarks, I\u2019ll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan : Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Emma, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : . : Sam Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Sam Pearlstein : Could you talk a little bit more about Aerospace and the margin? I mean you said that is was not sustainable but there were a couple of headwinds that you had identified before what might hold the margins back this year and so I guess what of that did we not see in the quarter? Phebe Novakovic : So as we\u2019ve talked about before Aerospace margins tend to be lumpy and estimating that with precision is kind of like putting the tail on a moving donkey. But that said in the quarter, we had a very favorable service mix high service levels with a good mix. We recognized some tax credits, suppliers\u2019 settlement. So it was really more on the upside than really any headwinds but the risk of getting ahead of our second quarter guidance I\u2019ve already noted to you that our quarter one margins were above our expectations and we\u2019re going to beat the guidance I gave you in January I\u2019m just not sure by what amount. So I want to reserve those commentary to the second quarter. Sam Pearlstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jonathan Raviv : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jon Raviv in for Jason. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Jon. Jonathan Raviv : Phebe, just an notional question or high level question about your net cash position, what are you seeing in terms of deployment opportunities here given your very attractive balance sheet? Phebe Novakovic : Well we\u2019re in a net cash position at the moment which Jason referred to and we tend to no debt position not trying to say net cash. I think we gave you guidance and our intention in January call we will deploy in the absence of any alternatives if there aren\u2019t any we will deploy all of our free cash flow and then to some to share repurchases and that strategy hasn\u2019t changed. Operator : Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning Phebe, Jason. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Carter. Carter Copeland : Phebe, I wondered if you could elaborate a little bit on the big surprise on the top line and IS&T obviously it\u2019s your shorter cycle business quite a big revenue delta from what you had talked about in the prior quarter. Wondered if you could just give us some color on what it was that shifted or came in into the quarter? How should we think about thinking of the impacts on the remainder of the year in terms of performance and just any color you could give would be great. Phebe Novakovic : So, we had an increased sales activity across both Mission Systems and our GD IT business. our Mission Systems it was driven part by lower cost structure that we anticipated as a result of combined AIS and C4 which made us more competitive and that tends to be a pretty quick turnaround so some of the orders quickly turn into sales. We had good book to bill by the way in that program or in that whole group so that also us well for greater growth. But as we combined those two businesses we\u2019re seeing some additional sales volumes that comes in by the strength of going to market. On the IT business they\u2019ve won most of what they\u2019ve been bidding on. They are a power in the market space. And so look I don\u2019t have a sense of where we\u2019re going to end up in that business in particular given all the puts and takes by the end of the year but we\u2019ll have a real good sense by the end of next quarter. But a solid beat on revenues and we\u2019re very pleased. Carter Copeland : Thanks, Phebe. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace side in terms of the large cabin markets and may be give us a feel of what some of the different regions particularly you\u2019re looking overseas outside the U.S? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. The activity levels I would call as careful, in other words, we\u2019ve got plenty of pipeline but slow to contract not unlike what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. In short, North American and the Mid - East are okay. Russia, Latin America and China are slow at the moment, 650 ER demand is robust so we\u2019re holding our own and then some. I think however, it\u2019s important to understand the of the case behind how we\u2019ve won this business how we have historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is a decline in earnings. So accordingly, we always throw production down in the face of weak orders. We have no intention of doing so this year. Given our large 650 backlog we can, to some degree, feather in more 650s to cover potential downfalls and of course we always take cost out of that business. So I think the way to think about both streams for the next two years is not necessarily as a strong revenue growth story. Gross over turn for the new airports enter into service and this is pretty much in line with what we had anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean sheets design airplanes. So, I thought it would be helpful to give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act but I\u2019d say that the first quarter was cautious coming after a robust fourth quarter and this is pretty much of what we have seen in the first quarter for the last couple of years. Robert Stallard : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe just may be pick up on the last question I think you said the next couple of years, and just on the G500 entering the service it does seem like you\u2019re certainly ahead of where you could be? But without pulling for the schedule in this conference call, green deliveries will there be a source of good revenue growth in 2017 like the 650 was in 2011? Phebe Novakovic : So, we\u2019ll start to recognize activity in 2017 in anticipation of entry into service in the first quarter of 2018. It\u2019s really in the next two years and it\u2019s a transition period, I think that\u2019s how you should think about it and we anticipate it that as well. And you could expect that given that we\u2019ve got new airplanes coming on. Myles Walton : And just which was on the inventory of used aircraft, you sold one in the quarter, did the level of used inventory that you\u2019re holding rise, fall or stayed the same? Phebe Novakovic : No, it was the same. Myles Walton : Same. Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Yes, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : Just continuing on with Gulfstream, when you look at the transition period and think about what trajectory might be for 450 and 550 deliveries, could you give us a sense on how you envision that going or sort of what their backlogs are right now for those airplanes? And then when you think about it, as you said before, you have the ability to take 650 up, given a lot of strong demand for that airplane, do you see the potential to increase rates some on 650 within that next two year period? Phebe Novakovic : So, we haven\u2019t given you the backlog and broken it up by aircraft model, but again let\u2019s just talk about the theory of the case. When you\u2019re bringing in new aircraft, the trick is to feather in that production with the existing plane. So that you have a nice, smooth transition and that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for and that\u2019s what we will achieve. There\u2019s no reason to think that that isn\u2019t going to happen. The 650 has a quite a significant order book and in fact, the deliveries the next to billable airplanes has actually slipped to the fourth quarter to \u201817. So that healthy and long backlog gives us some flexibility, nice flexibility to feather in some more 650s to offset that transition period the feathering in as we move to the new airplanes. So wouldn\u2019t be all together a bad thing either that would reduce the wait time on those 650s and the 650 ER demand. Doug Harned : So you are seeing the potential to - the demand out there to do some earlier 650 deliveries if you want to? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. We\u2019re going to be prudent about it. It\u2019s not wise to eat through your backlog, but to the extent that we can and want to we will feather in some additional 650s if that makes sense. Doug Harned : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Robert Spingarn : Jason, I\u2019ve got one for you if I could, it\u2019s on the free cash flow which was really quite strong in the quarter. I think Phebe said last quarter that international advanced timing would put some pressure on free cash flow this year and it did in the quarter, but their collections looked very strong. Could you talk about working capital and how we should think about the cadence of free cash flows and go forward through the year? Jason Aiken : Sure. We were, as you said, off to a strong start in the first quarter and to be quite frank, stronger than even we had expected. As we signaled coming into the year, we\u2019re expecting a bit of a softer cash flow outlook and as you think would expect in response to that our business has turned toward sort of war on operating working capital and went after it hard first quarter. And really that is the story. You could see even despite a pretty big draw down in the customer advances related to some of those international programs otherwise excluding that OWC was down in the quarter. So, really strong performance out of the gate, I would caution you that we don\u2019t necessarily expect the first quarter to be reflective of the full year. We\u2019re still expecting a tough road ahead with some of the headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about. But really our focus is all about that management at OWC and going after the collections as well as the supply side. Robert Spingarn : Is there any particular timing we should think about where some of this strength reverses? I mean I guess for the year you\u2019ll do about a 100% as you normally do or little better, but is there a weak quarter in here? Jason Aiken : I would suggest the second half is where most of the pressure is there on that front. So we\u2019ll be managing that through the balance of the year. Robert Spingarn : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you and terrific performance, Phebe. Well done. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Cai. Cai von Rumohr : So, Aerospace, may be if you could kind of give us the numbers you give us on the lead times on each of those programs and little color. You mentioned the suppliers settlement may be if you could quantify any one - timers that bolstered the numbers in the first quarter at Aerospace? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, so as I noted the 650 and 650 ER are out to the fourth quarter \u201817 G550 G450 out in 12 month where they have been, G280 and G150 G280 at the end of this year 150 first quarter next year. So pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve been reporting all along. As I tried to explain earlier we had a number of moving targets in the Gulfstream margin provided considerable margin improvement service mix we took in some tax credits. We did have that supplier settlement I\u2019m not going to give you any particular numbers on any of these and jet performed well. So couple of those are one timers but I\u2019m not going to quantify them for you I don\u2019t think that\u2019s productive. We\u2019re very particularly with respect to our suppliers we are very proprietary about talking about our relationships with our suppliers. Cai von Rumohr : Can you quantify the total of all of those without giving any of the granularity? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, I mean we\u2019ve led you to about 18% for the year I didn\u2019t give you by quarter - by - quarter as I explained to you before we get real lumpiness in Aerospace margins which we\u2019ve talked about. So I\u2019m not prepared to change the year guidance but you can back in to some of that. As I said, this is - both streams has an awful lot of moving parts and so does Jet Aviation so, we have seen in the last couple of years lot of lumpiness. We\u2019re not going to see that 20% repeated going forward as explained to you we\u2019re going to outperform I just don\u2019t know I have much yet and I can\u2019t discuss that half way through the year. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Peter Arment : Phebe, may be just to stay on Aerospace, you mentioned Jet Aviation continues to be a positive contributor. Can you give us little more color on what you\u2019re seeing there and also related to that are you seeing any kind of slowdown in utilization rates in the large cabin tight kind of the energy market just given these sell off the way we see it last six months? Phebe Novakovic : We continue to build that business. They\u2019ve been a positive contributor on both cash and earnings for the last 2.5, 3 years. We\u2019ve seen no change in demand as a result of - no decrease in demand as a result of the change in oil prices, in fact, we\u2019re seeing higher demand. Backlog, the pipeline is good and we\u2019re adding to the backlog. So, that business is increasingly well positioned. Peter Arment : Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Howard. Howard Rubel : How are you? Phebe Novakovic : Good. Howard Rubel : I don\u2019t want to leave Marine alone here. Phebe Novakovic : Good. Howard Rubel : I mean you did spend a little time there, so I figure it\u2019s probably a worn off a little on you. So there\u2019s couple things that stand out. One was the backlog growth second was you kind of LHA post shakedown availability which sort of sets you up to do some interesting things. And it looks like NAASCO did pretty well in a world where commercial is hard to do. So, may be you could talk a little bit about some of the variances and is this sustainable rate you\u2019re seeing in Marine or was there some deliveries or some other material items that sort of tweak the numbers? Phebe Novakovic : I think what you can expect is Marine will replicate its behavior in the past such as steady Eddy. There was no one particular element that drove margin performance. With respect to sales growth, that\u2019s coming from a couple of places. We have increased sales at NAASCO on commercial work, and remember we\u2019re moving into the Block IV which brings with it higher revenue and also we\u2019re seeing increased revenue on the engineering and design for Ohio replacement. So, all of those are long - term programs that will continue to carry revenue and predictable earnings with them. Howard Rubel : And just to follow up for a moment, how is it that - what have you done there to make sure, for example at NAASCO, that there\u2019s some opportunity to continue the business because I know that\u2019s always challenging from time to time? And then also, making sure that Ohio replacement stays on schedule. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so with respect to NAASCO, they\u2019ve got a nice backlog commercial and government may be new construction and recall, repair continues to grow for NAASCO. We have a bi - coastal presence back when I was AVP of the Marine Group, we\u2019ve got a couple of East Coast repair yards that have done beautifully. So we\u2019ve really increased our hiring power in repair and we\u2019re performing very nicely. The repair business is moving to and the Navy is moving to from cost plus contracts to fixed pricing repair in selected instances. And that\u2019s a real upside potential for us, we\u2019re really pleased with that. So, the repair business is robust. NAASCO is performing well, they keep their cost bases low for continuous improvement and that is a highly functioning shipyard. So, I like where they stand. They\u2019re competitive in the commercial market space and of course, [indiscernible] as well continues to drive down its cost structure. And we\u2019ll see over time increased margin improvement as we get further into Block IV in a continuous improvement. Every time you start a new Block, we have some questions in margins we\u2019ve given back some of the goodness of the prior Block to the Navy, but we, over the last decade plus, reduced cost structure and continue to improve margin. So, they\u2019re very, very well positioned. Howard Rubel : Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. David Strauss : Phebe could you dig in a little bit more into the growth that we saw at Combat, it sounds like it came through ahead of what your expectations were? Was this [indiscernible] you in case starting to ramp up and does it accelerate from here? Phebe Novakovic : I lost part of your question, it broke up. Could you repeat it for us? David Strauss : Can you hear me now? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah. I can hear you now. David Strauss : I was asking if you could dig a little bit more into the growth at Combat, it sounded like it did come through ahead of your expectations, is that in the UK program starting to ramp and does that actually accelerate from here? And then a separate question, press has report that you pulled out of a couple of programs in the quarter, competitions TX and Manpack if you could just touch on those as well? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So look you would expect with the prodigious increase in backlog that we experienced last year that we begin to see that backlog turn into sales and revenue increases and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in that group. But across the portfolio, on our Canadian Middle East contract, we are finishing up our design efforts and the initial variance and we are going to begin production later this year. The delivery is in \u201816 on the UK program, we\u2019re working some small quantities of pre - productions but again, that will begin to ramp up and there is - the army is increasing its capitalization in their wheel and track vehicles, so all of that is upside and that we\u2019ve recognized some of that. So look, that backlog is still flowing into sales and the key there is to perform on that backlog. So let me talk to you, you asked the second question that is kind of interesting that we have pulled out some competitions, let me give you a sort of theory of the case here. We are not going to compete for programs to respond RFPs where we do not believe that we can get a fair and sufficient returns. Chasing revenues that don\u2019t have good earnings doesn\u2019t help us or our shareholders. So this really has more to do with the discipline with how we run our company rather than the response in any particular program. We\u2019re just not going to compete in programs what we think that we can\u2019t make up their return and a good return. David Strauss : Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please proceed. Ronald Epstein : Good morning, Phebe. I just wanted to touch base quickly if you could remind us what you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation, particularly there\u2019s some new properties on the market right? I mean that might be an opportunity for you guys to do some vertical integration? Just what are you thinking about, M&A, vis - \u00e0 - vis cash return to shareholders? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, so Ron I\u2019m not thinking about M&A because I\u2019m not seeing anything. So it\u2019s again not on my radar screen. And our intent with respect to capital deployment remains the same for this year. We\u2019re going to return capital to our shareholders and share repurchases and dividend. So I think that\u2019s pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing and what we\u2019ve been saying. Okay? Ronald Epstein : Yeah, that\u2019s great. Can I ask one quick follow on if I may? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. Ronald Epstein : Could you give us a quick update on how things are proceeding with the G600 program the development there and the developments on the G500 program? Phebe Novakovic : So we\u2019re proceeding well on both the near term G500, we had our first flight this quarter and we\u2019re on track with no particular surprises. And the G600 we\u2019re starting to build the first prototype so all\u2019s well. We\u2019re on track and in line with our expectations were. Ronald Epstein : Okay. Just curious if there\u2019s any chance that the 500 could happen sooner, if certified sooner? Phebe Novakovic : You mean first flight or entry into service? Ronald Epstein : Entry into service, yeah. Phebe Novakovic : That will depend on the FAA\u2019s test program so that\u2019s really - we work really closely with the FAA. They have an important job to do and we\u2019re really working together there of pacing items here. Ronald Epstein : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Good morning. Thanks for the time. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Hunter Keay : Hey Phebe, I want to follow up on the question in your response to David\u2019s question, the comment on TX specifically or just broadly about how you\u2019re not going to invest on. We\u2019re not going to be it on programs that don\u2019t provide fair or decent returns to your shareholders. Was there something about the comment about TX specifically but there was something about the way that particular program was structured that appealed to you or was it more a comment was broadly about investments it would require from you guys given that\u2019s not sort of in your core wheel house to participate in that program with the sort of ambiguous return? The latter? Phebe Novakovic : To fit in the nutshell. It\u2019s not in our core. We had been thinking about participating on the air front was interested in the off the shelf trainer. Once the climate started to change there isn\u2019t just no way that becomes an attractive program for us. So I think the appropriate response and good discipline what\u2019s the prior that we just politely bow out. Hunter Keay : Okay, thank you, Phebe. And then quick follow up, can you update the pre - owned delivery expectations this year or you\u2019re still thinking it\u2019s going to be up year over year how should we think about that? Thanks for the time. In Aerospace. Jason Aiken : Yeah, I think as we look at the year we\u2019re still expecting the numbers to be up a little bit from what we see in the past couple of years so little bit lighter in the first quarter than what we were expecting but balance of the year we\u2019re still seeing that coming. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thanks everybody. Operator : Okay, thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed. Peter Skibitski : Hey great quarter guys. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you. Peter Skibitski : Phebe, I just wanted to go further on capital deployment. I like when I\u2019m hearing about stay away from M&A frankly it kind of begs the question on repurchases because I think you got a new 10 million authority in February. And I\u2019m guessing coming out of the quarter probably only left about 7 million shares, you\u2019re probably going to do 2 billion plus in cash for the rest of the year so I\u2019m wondering do you plan to go back to the board some time may be this summer to increase the authority? Phebe Novakovic : So look, we came at out of the Gate strong on cash as I told what I told the Street on January is the way you think about 2015 cash is that we\u2019re going to have a lighter cash year than we typically do have. And I\u2019m not prepared to change that. So do not think about the cash generation in terms that we have historical terms. But that said, let Jason give you a little more color on where we are on the share repurchases. Jason Aiken : Yeah, I think you were pretty close on your estimates there. We had about 2 to 2.5 billion shares remaining by our buyer authorization when we got the additional 10 million in February. And I think we\u2019re sitting with right around 7.7 or so remaining at this point so. So I think that I\u2019ll look at Phebe but anything beyond that at the discretion of our board. Peter Skibitski : And hey Jason I didn\u2019t hear you object when Rob suggested a onetime free cash conversion for the year? Jason Aiken : No, I think as Phebe signaled and I apologize if I missed that question or his predicate, as Phebe mentioned we\u2019re not expecting to be quite as strong as their traditional performance this year. So expect something little bit lighter than that little bit lighter than the first quarter. Peter Skibitski : Okay, thank a lot. Phebe Novakovic : Emma I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay, so your last question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. Please proceed. Joe DeNardi : Phebe with IS&T and some of the outperformance you\u2019ve seen there really over the past, 12 months at this point is it more a reflection of the budget environment and the procurement behavior being better than expected or is that the win rate has been better? Phebe Novakovic : We\u2019re seeing a little bit more activity on the budget side but it\u2019s really our win rate has improved as we continue to take cost out of our business we become more competitive. And by the way that\u2019s true in the United States, Canada and the UK which is where Mission Systems placed heavily. Joe DeNardi : Okay, thank you. Erin Linnihan : Okay. Well thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703 - 876 - 3583. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes this presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.",

My name is Matthew and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Matthew and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Erin and good morning. Well, as you may have observed from our press release, we enjoyed a particularly strong second quarter, with revenue of $7.88 billion and net earnings of $752 million. We reported EPS of $2.27 per diluted share, $0.39 ahead of earnings from continuing operations in the year ago quarter. We were also $0.21 per share better than consensus. Revenue of $7.88 billion is $408 million higher than the year ago quarter. That represents year-over-year revenue growth of 5.5%. Earnings from continuing operations of $752 million is $106 million higher on the strength of 13.7% operating margins, a 100 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. I should note that our earnings include a modest gain on the sale of our commercial cyber products business in the IS&T segment. Excluding that gain, operating margin would be 13.4% and EPS would be $2.22 still substantially better than all comparative quarters and consensus. Sequentially, revenue was up $98 million, or 1.3%, and net earnings are up $36 million on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2014. Revenue was up 6.3%. Operating earnings at $2.11 billion are up 15.6%. Net earnings from continuing operations are up over 18%. In short, we are off to a very good start, well ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I will provide some additional color on that guidance shortly. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and then the half and then I will conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and tie that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace, Aerospace had a good quarter with revenue of $2.3 billion, $263 million higher than the year ago quarter and a $55 million improvement in operating earnings. Jet Aviation once again made a strong contribution with double-digit operating margins. For the first half of 2015 compared to the first half of last year, Aerospace revenue was up $246 million or 6%, operating earnings are up $82 million or 10.4% on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins. Let me spend a moment on the business aviation marketplace. There has been much speculation about it in a lot of what I would call Rumor Intelligence, or RUMINT. From an order perspective, Gulfstream enjoyed its best discrete second quarter since the second quarter of 2008. The end result is an approximate $1 billion increase in the Aerospace group funded backlog, with Gulfstream as the primary reason. The U.S. economy remains strong particularly compared to others in the world. So, it should be no surprise that North America dominated the order book in the quarter. The sales pipeline remained steady across all models. We have seen no decline in the level of interest and a particularly encouraging return of S&P 500 companies as they seek to replenish aging fleets. I should add that the first flight of the G500 occurred in the quarter and the test program is proceeding on schedule. Next, Combat Systems, Combat had a great quarter. Revenue is $1.41 billion, $57 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins to 16.1% resulted in a modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter, all-in-all, a very strong performance. For the first half, revenue increased 1.8% against the first half of 2014. Operating earnings are up $71 million or 19.8%, resulting in 230 basis point margin expansion against the first half of last year, pretty impressive. Marine Group revenue of $2 billion is higher than second quarter 2014 by $150 million or 8.1%. Operating earnings are up $13 million or 7.5% against the year ago quarter. Revenue was up nicely on a sequential basis and operating earnings are constant on a 40 basis point reduction in margins. For the first half, Marine Group revenue of $3.94 billion is up $492 million against the first half of 2014. This is a very strong 14.3% growth. Operating earnings are up $35 million, 10.3% on slightly lower margins. Margins were still a very respectable 9.5% for the first half. Marine Systems has been a compelling story for us and will continue to be so. We have a little work to do, however, on margins in the second half. You may recall that IS&T is a place where we expected a 5.5% contraction in revenue for the year. Well, fortunately, we are doing materially better than that. Revenue of $2.2 billion is up $52 million or 2.4% against 2014 second quarter. But the real story is operating earnings. They are up $449 million on a 200 basis point improvement operating margins against the year ago quarter. As I previously noted, the sale of our cyber products business provided some profit in the quarter. On a normalized basis, without that gain, margins would have been 9.7%, an increase of 100 basis points over the year ago quarter. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue is up $141 million or 3.2% and operating earnings are up $83 million over 22% on a 160 basis point improvement. Once again, on a normalized basis, operating margins would have been 9.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the first half of 2014. This is a very good news story and as you are going to hear in a moment, it will continue. So, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to expect revenue of approximately $9.4 billion and operating margins around 18%. We now believe revenue will be off by about $250 million to $300 million. On the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18.5% for the year, resulting in about the same as anticipated operating earnings. The 18.5% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half due largely to mix shift, increased R&D spending, building airplanes for use in the test program, and a planned reduction in production at Jet Aviation Basel. To that point, we are performing the engineering work at Basel necessary to induct a full complement of airplanes into production in the first quarter next year. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue similar to 2014 or about $5.7 billion with margins around 15%. We continue to expect revenue consistent with prior guidance. Margins, however, will be in the 40 to 50 basis point higher range resulting in higher-than-predicted operating earnings for the year. In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% or approximately $7.5 billion and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now expect revenue of approximately $7.8 billion, which translates to growth of 6.7% against last year. Margin rates will be about 10 basis points better than previously forecast. The higher revenue and somewhat better margins will once again result in higher operating earnings and earlier forecast. By the way, the operating margin result will be driven by a double-digit fourth quarter. For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 5.5% or about $8.7 billion of revenue and a margin rate around 9%. It now appears that revenue will be between $9 billion to $9.1 billion and the margin rate should be about 70 basis points better than guidance. Once again, this will result in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year. In summary all of this rolls into revenue for the year of $31.7 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin around 13% and a return on sales from continuing operations slightly in excess of 9%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a modestly lower tax rate and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to be between $8.70 to $8.80. The progression through the remainder of the year is that we will see a third quarter just weaker than the second and a fourth quarter that looks very much like the second quarter. I would like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I have got just a couple of quick financial items to go over before we start the question-and-answer period. First, I will follow-up on a point we addressed in last quarter\u2019s call and that\u2019s impact we are seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. When you compare our second quarter results to the year ago period, our 2015 revenues and operating earnings would have been higher by $130 million and $20 million respectively, at the exchange rates that prevailed in the second quarter of 2014 remained in effect this year. Combined with the first quarter results, our revenues and operating earnings were reduced by $250 million and $40 million so far this year as a result of the strengthening of the dollar. Stated another way, absent the headwind from the translation of our international business in the U.S. dollars, our revenue growth in the first half would have been 8%. Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $20 million versus $24 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline was driven largely by the repayment of $500 million of debt in January. For 2015, we expect interest expense to be approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position and that\u2019s cash in excess of debt of $690 million. This is down by almost $400 million from the prior quarter due to our capital deployment activities, which I will address in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected as we continue to see the benefit of higher international earnings. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the low 29% range. We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2015 to be $185 million, and most of that funding is expected to occur in the third quarter. A quick point of color on the cash flow statement is included in our release. One item you will note is cash proceeds from asset sales in the first half of just shy of $260 million. We have mentioned from time-to-time some of the small scaled portfolio shaping we have been doing and that\u2019s what you see there. So that\u2019s primarily the divestitures of our commercial cyber business, which Phebe mentioned just a few minutes ago and AxleTech, which closed earlier in the year. And on the subject of share repurchases. In the quarter, we purchased slightly less than 7.5 million shares for just over $1 billion. We have purchased a little more than 12 million shares in the first half for just shy of $1.7 billion. And in total, when combined with dividends paid, we returned approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, well ahead of our free cash flow for the first half. At the end of the second quarter, we have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to continue to execute our 2015 capital deployment strategy. Erin that concludes my remarks and I will turn the mic back over to for you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan : Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions please get back into the queue. Matthew, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Thanks, Erin. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Ronald Epstein : Hi. Yes, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning. Ronald Epstein : Just maybe a quick question on the biz jet market, the way you characterized it, it sounds great, just \u2013 but other suppliers have said maybe not so, so my sense is are you guys picking up share, I mean you have a primary competitor who is kind of wounded out there right now and I am just curious if you are picking up share in the large jet market? Phebe Novakovic : There has been an awful lot of discussion about reported weakness in that large-cabin market, but not from us. And it\u2019s not automatic that the factors that are impacting others are impacting us. We really don\u2019t think about share. The way we conduct our businesses is that we look at our order which was robust and our pipeline, which remained strong. So I am not in a position to comment what others are seeing, but we are continuing to see interest across all of our product lines. Ronald Epstein : Okay, great. And then if I can just a quick follow-on, something you didn\u2019t talk about too much on your prepared remarks is how is it going on the Ohio class program now in the ship business and if you can give us an update on that and how the outlook for that looks? Phebe Novakovic : So Ohio engineering and Virginia construction are really the two main drivers of increased revenue, which is not what you asked but it gives us a certain context. And let me give you some color. We are in the middle of the Ohio replacement design development program and it\u2019s progressing on schedule. We are the prime and we are working on all of the ship arrangement systems, components, development, missile system compartment in order to support the start of the lead ship, which is in 2021. So we are doing very, very well by all indicators in our engineering design efforts. Ronald Epstein : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed. David Strauss : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. David Strauss : Phebe, during the quarter I guess last couple of quarters, we have seen some of your competitors make some moves in terms of M&A, Lockheed with Sikorsky and then Raytheon with Websense, can you talk about how you view M&A today and how you are thinking about capital deployment overall? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So I see M&A today the way I have been seeing it. There is nothing that we are looking at now. Our capital deployment strategy is consistent with what we have been talking to you about. In the absence of accretive and good acquisition candidates in our space, we are going to continue to return cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases. David Strauss : As a quick follow-up to the Gulfstream order activity in the quarter, could you give us any color in terms of by product line, what you saw maybe on the 650 and what the order activity looks like on the new products, the 500 and 600? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So, we are not going to dissect for you the demand by product and by airplane, but let\u2019s just \u2013 suffice it to say that we had good demand across our entire portfolio and that means our entire portfolio. And when we look at the pipeline, the interest that we see in the pipeline likewise translates to demand signal across our portfolio. Erin Linnihan : Matthew, can we take the next question please? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks very much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, just a point of clarification, did you cut your Aerospace revenue forecast by $350 million versus your previous guidance and if so what has changed that? Phebe Novakovic : Look, we reduced I think between $250 million and $300 million. And there are an awful lot of moving parts in this business that as we get halfway through the year, we get some additional clarity. It\u2019s really nothing more than across the whole line of our products and services, which is \u2013 this is really some moving around among quarters, between fiscal years. But the business is still growing. I don\u2019t particularly see the reduction of the increase in estimates from 8% to 6% particularly its positive for any market factors. It\u2019s simply the management of the business. Robert Stallard : Is there particular models that have come off more than you originally anticipated, I know you don\u2019t want to give a little detail on this, but is this generally what\u2019s happened? Phebe Novakovic : No, it\u2019s just as we look \u2013 we have got a whole series of moving parts in that business, including building additional airplanes for the test program, mix in our service business and then the mix in any one particular quarter over the fiscal years of deliveries in large cabin and medium cabin. So, we are likely to see some medium cabin, about three or four of them moving to next year, but that\u2019s largely a question of preference on the part of the customers. So, there is nothing material here. It\u2019s simply an update as we get halfway through the year to give you just some more clarity of what we see. Robert Stallard : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sam Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Sam Pearlstein : I wanted to go back on the Marine side, I mean, normally a fairly predictable business to go from 2% growth to 6% growth seems unusual. So, I am assuming its Ohio class. And then wouldn\u2019t that cause kind of a negative margin shift rather than a 10 basis point increase? And I don\u2019t know if you can highlight, you said they have a lot of work to do in the second half on the margin front. What needs to happen there? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, it\u2019s a couple of things that are driving \u2013 couple of programs that are driving our revenue. One is increased Virginia class construction. Ohio engineering revenue has increased quite a bit over last year, both of those. And then the commercial ship construction at NASSCO is increasing as our backlog of the ECO tankers and our construction cycles. So, those are the three factors that are increasing our outlook for the year. On margins, we just have some work to do across the portfolio. If you think about what the history has been on blocks of submarines. Block IV is still in its early stages. And so as we continue our reengineering efforts, we expect to realize some cost savings, which will improve performance and margins on Block IV. That\u2019s going to be a longer term proposition. We historically, throughout that program, have recognized higher margins as we progress further into the construction. So, we see some long-term margin expansion opportunities there and we are seeing some \u2013 we are seeing very good performance at NASSCO on their ECO tanker construction and on the MLP for the Navy. And then we have got some margin compression at Bath Iron Works that we need to continue to work through on our DDG-1000 program. And I don\u2019t expect that, but often typical of a new class of ships, particularly one that is as powerful and transformational warship as DDG-1000 is. So, we have got a little ways to go on that and we are working with our Navy customer on our vendors and their vendors to get that first ship into sea trials, so more to come. Sam Pearlstein : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, I wondered if we could turn to IS&T or back to IS&T for a minute, talk about what\u2019s driving the strength there? How you look at that business over time? And particularly, on the margins, how much of this is just \u2013 is volume driven versus cost reduction as we go forward? Phebe Novakovic : There is an interesting correlation between volume increases and cost reduction. As you may recall, we have integrated two of our previous standalone businesses in IS&T and Creative Mission Systems and they had a particularly strong quarter across the board. So \u2013 and I am continuing to see good continued strength in those areas and I am particularly pleased with their margin improvement, which is driving the higher earnings and frankly allows them to increase their win rate. Their cost-cutting efforts have been exemplary and there is more to come in that business. On our service business, it\u2019s steady year-over-year. And sequentially, they just need to work their margins hard, which is always their challenge in their highly competitive business. But all-in-all, IS&T is doing extremely well and I think will continue to do well. And again, our win rate is better, because our performance operationally is good and our costs are coming down and increasingly pace of which is increasing in cost-cutting, so very impressive. Robert Spingarn : Yes. And then just as a second question or follow-up, maybe for Jason, on the cash flow conversion for the year, how are you thinking about that relative to before especially now that the forecast is a bit higher from a performance standpoint? Jason Aiken : I think our expectations for the full year are consistent with what we have said right from the beginning a weaker than \u2013 or softer than typical year. Our priority is always to pull cash forward. So, we had a pretty decent performance in the first half. I think we had close to 80% conversion rate free cash flow to net income, but we had predicted before and are still looking at a softer second half as we profile a lot of the supplier payments associated with the advances that we got on some large contracts last year and year before flowing out in the balance of the year. So, I think our expectations are essentially consistent with where we started in the year. Robert Spingarn : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Myles Walton : Bonus points for using the word axiomatic, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : I am sure you didn\u2019t have to look it up. Myles Walton : No, I am engineer. So the one question I have for you was on the backlog in bookings at Gulfstream, in particular. Some other manufacturers have seen the fleet buyers kind of come back and place orders. How much of the strength here is fleet buying? It sounds like it\u2019s not, but I just want to confirm that. And also as it relates to your search for upward bias on the G650 rates, how comfortable are you with where the supply chain can take us? Phebe Novakovic : So, let\u2019s first define our terms. When we say fleet, what we mean is Fortune 500 companies coming back in and replenishing their entire fleet. And so not surprisingly, the preponderance of our backlog is in public and private companies and high net worth individuals. They comprise a majority of our backlog. I don\u2019t track our \u2013 what you can call fractional owners, fractional buyers, but it\u2019s not significant and I don\u2019t really worry about it too much. It\u2019s a very steady backlog when we look at it. We know these people in the backlog. They have been here before and a lot of strengths and consistency. Myles Walton : And then the supply chain for the 650? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, the supply chain for the 650, we are thinking about feathering in the 650 over additional ones and two units over time and the supply chain can easily manage that. We have been in discussions with them. And we are not talking about massive changes in the production rate, but simply lot of these [indiscernible] the transition period. Myles Walton : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the 650 question, because as you have talked about potentially feathering in some earlier, what are you looking for as a trigger to make a decision to bring some 650s forward? Phebe Novakovic : Well, when we look at our plan for the next couple of years and get some clarity around that, then we will have the ability to ramp up, again not in large order of magnitude numbers, but in ones that are easily manageable. So, that will be largely our planning process that we do in the fall and that will set the guidance that we will give you in the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year. So, there is no catalytic trigger, it\u2019s more our internal planning. Doug Harned : But when you think about this also in terms of margins, you said recently that the margins had not, on the 650, quite reached the level of the 550. When you look at \u2013 how do you look at the margin trajectory now? And how does that tie into potential changes in rate? Phebe Novakovic : So, the margin potential on the 650, I think we have got another year to 18 months before it eclipses the 550. So, I don\u2019t really think about bringing forward 650s to boost our margins. I am thinking about bringing them forward to just smooth the entire business. And so there are less perturbations as we go through our transition, but we are \u2013 we have talked about this quite a bit, the margin performance on the 650 we haven\u2019t seen how good we can get there. Doug Harned : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. A question about \u2013 I have question about Jet Aviation and the planned reduction at Basel later in the year, curious what\u2019s driving that and what you are doing to manage that and to what extent that\u2019s driving the lower Aerospace sales outlook? Phebe Novakovic : That is a \u2013 think about it this way. We added significantly to the backlog of Jet Aviation with single aisle and double aisle airplane completions in the first half. So we need to and we are in the process of doing the engineering work, so that we can induct these airplanes in the first quarter and second quarter of next year into the production cycle. So this is a \u2013 when you have an inflow of order \u2013 orders and the completions on these airplanes require a fair amount of high level engineering on the front end, engineering and design. So to integrate that, get that engineering design done, so we\u2019re ready to move into full rate production at a very efficient rate is I think judicious and was part of our plan all along. You need to do that in order to produce these things that \u2013 at a effective margin level and profitability. The Jet Aviation has some impact in the second quarter, if you would imagine, particularly given their double-digit contribution the last few quarters. Jon Raviv : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi George. George Shapiro : Phebe if I look at the Aerospace margin for the six months, it\u2019s 19.9. And I would venture for the second quarter if I took out maybe $75 million or $100 million of probably zero margin pre-owned sales, it would have been north of 20%. So what gets the margin down to 17.5% or so on average in the second half or even 17% to get you to average only 18.5% for the year? Phebe Novakovic : George, for years I have enjoyed your complex questions that are built on a series of assumptions. Let me try to simplify this in the way that we think about it. In the first half, we had a number of factors that contributed to higher margins. One was a fairly significant settlement that we had with a supplier. The second was some R&D tax credit. And then going forward, we are going to increase our R&D spend. Jet Aviation is going to have significantly lower in the half earnings and margin rate as we just discussed. And we have got a whole lot of mix shift issued in the service and when airplanes come into green delivery and final delivery, so it\u2019s awful lot of moving parts, did that help you? George Shapiro : Yes, that helped some. Just also is it fair to say that revenues in pre-owned were 75 to 100 in this quarter with probably zero profit contribution? Phebe Novakovic : I don\u2019t really follow that, but that would feel about right. But look, the way to think about this, there is nothing happening in the second half of this year that should cause concern to the underlying structure of the business. It\u2019s simply a matter of different moving parts, it\u2019s a mix in the business, the R&D spend as we build more airplanes into the test program, so I think the way to think about this specifically is there is no underlying systemic issue here, it\u2019s just the normal puts and takes. George Shapiro : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes. Phebe terrific numbers. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Cai. Cai Von Rumohr : So could you give us a little more sense of the low quarterly in Aerospace in the third, in the fourth quarter and maybe, you have two quarters here where you have beaten kind of the cautious guidance you have given us. And maybe the specific variances in the second quarter as to why in that quarter, you were so much better than you kind of indicated you might be? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Well, we had a wholesome mix on the service side. Service revenue is up and the mix was very wholesome. And Jet Aviation had a terrific quarter. So all in all, that\u2019s helped drive our \u2013 what you might think of this outperformance. But look, I think we have tried to talk over the last few years about the futility of attempting to get and predict precise quarterly margin rates at this business that has so many different moving parts different products, different service, mix as an issue, we have got Jet Aviation in there. So it\u2019s \u2013 we are comfortable that we are directionally correct. Do we have, with exact precision, what third quarter margins are going to be, they are going to be less and they are going to be significantly less and a little bit better in the fourth quarter. So I think that\u2019s reflecting \u2013 that slows down into the overall guidance that we gave you in terms of progression of EPS, which is a lighter third quarter compared to second and a fourth quarter that looks a lot like the second quarter and Gulfstream contributes to that. Cai Von Rumohr : That\u2019s very helpful. And then on the order front, you have talked about the strength in the U.S. and Fortune 500 companies, you didn\u2019t mention emerging markets, I guess there has been some talk of weakness in China, Russia, Latin America, could you talk about the foreign markets and are you seeing just overall in your Aerospace business, requests for push outs or deferrals or requests for accelerations of plants? Thanks so much. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we have very carefully controlled and monitored our exposure to the emerging markets because of their great volatility. So we are cautious and I think you have seen that behavior in our dealing and in our interchange with emerging markets. We have some very good reliable customers in each of those markets, but they tend to be hyperbolic in their demand. They are in one quarter, out the next quarter. So there really hasn\u2019t been much activity in the emerging market space for a number of quarters now. I would add that the Mid-East continues to be pretty wholesome for us. And \u2013 but the real powerhouse here is North America. And by the way, it\u2019s nice not to have too much exposure to highly volatile markets. You can get yourself down in a boxed can in a big hurry. Cai Von Rumohr : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Howard. Howard Rubel : Good morning, Phebe. When you became CEO, the agenda was relatively clear, set some standards and if we kind of look back for a moment, the numbers are pretty darn good today and so how do you \u2013 I mean we get the bar and the increase right now, but when we looked at sort of the numbers going forward, they are pretty darn good. So how do you raise the bar from here and what are sort of some of the agenda items, because in some cases, this year is well understood and it\u2019s really the challenges beyond that? Phebe Novakovic : So, let\u2019s give a little bit of retrospective since this management team took over. In 2013, we were largely focused on improving our operations and retiring a considerable amount of risk that we found in the company. We did all of that, so 2014 and continuing into this year was about building that backlog, taking the lower-cost structure that we had invested in and the cost reductions that we have made, along with our strong operating discipline and increasing our backlog very significantly and that worked. And we are not done. You never can take your eye off of operations. Without solid operating performance, everything else becomes ephemeral. So we got to continue to focus on taking costs out, continuous improvement reengineering, efforts aren\u2019t done. And we are \u2013 so we take those that low cost basis. And given the backlog, we are poised for growth this year, next year and through my current planning horizon. Our defense companies are growing. We have talked about the transition in Aerospace, but fundamentally, these defense companies across the board, they have the backlog in Combat and Marine and IS&T to continue to grow. So, now it\u2019s about growing earnings, it\u2019s about growing EPS based on increases in revenue and then it\u2019s our productivity. So, I think they are going to see more of the same, focus on the core, blocking and tackling, might not be the sexiest thing, but boy it really makes all the difference in performance. Howard Rubel : Well, I don\u2019t think you are going to get too many complaints. You have talked about \u2013 or Jason talked about the strength of the dollar, but that\u2019s a strength of your European operations, they now become lower costs on the international market and we did see recent order of I think it was out of Denmark. But could you talk for a moment about how that integration has worked? And what kind of aperture that has opened up in terms of opportunities both there and you do a little bit of IS&T also and how that\u2019s being pulled through, please? Phebe Novakovic : So, when we look ex-U.S. and ex-North America, our efforts in the UK and our European Land Systems have been exemplary and they really are the sort of the parable that describes what the journey the General Dynamics has been on. We take ELS, for example. We always knew that we were going to have to invest in that business, because when we purchased it, it had excess infrastructure. So, we made that investment and their cost structure and the wrap right now is at highly competitive levels. That was the competency of that management team. They are really performing. And all of our expectations were realized, because they did what they needed to do and we supported them in that. So, they have increasingly won every bit that they have been in. And the Denmark win was significant for them. It\u2019s a replacement of the M113 fleet about $500 million. We have been in Denmark for a while, but it was European Land Systems. Both their design excellence, operating performance and their understanding of that very important customer that allowed them to execute and win. In the UK, that\u2019s really been out of the Phoenix, right? I mean, out of the ashes rose the phoenix. Howard Rubel : Yes. Phebe Novakovic : We had to dismantle that entire business and turn it over to Land Systems to run the FB program, so the guys you knew how to build Combat vehicles actually were building the Combat vehicle and returned over the remaining IS&T businesses to Mission Systems and both have done a superb job of taking cost out increasing their competitiveness. So, I think you may just have heard, I think it\u2019s earlier this week, maybe even last week, the UK government announced another $630 million service and support contract for the SC program. You don\u2019t get that unless that you demonstrate your performance and we had a very affordable cost structure so that you can support the needs of your customers. So, that to me is as I said it\u2019s a parable of what can go right when you do what you need to do. Howard Rubel : Thank you. Erin Linnihan : Matthew, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Carter. Carter Copeland : How are you doing? I noted Myles liked the word axiomatic, but I preferred the phrase purported weakness, I thought that was quite concrete. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, well it helps to have been a liberalized measure. I do know the English language and I have known it quite specifically. Carter Copeland : I like it. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the brief comment you made around DDG-1000 and the work you have there. Is your plan and the rates, the booking rates there dependent on holding schedule or is there the potential for rework of significance there? Any color you can give us about what remains to be done there in terms of milestones and where the program stands? Phebe Novakovic : So, the next major milestone for the first ship, cost plus ship is going to sea trials. And the Navy, we have worked very, very closely with. They have, by the way, retained the integration responsibility for this partnership. So, we work very closely with them to work schedule and production so that we have minimized any lever, which is particularly challenging on the first acquired ship, but we are not seeing enormous amounts of rework. This is simply integrating, building and integrating a significantly \u2013 this is a huge, huge warship with an array of new technologies. And so that\u2019s some of the challenge. That said the fleet is anxious to get it, because of its clear war fighting capability. So, this is a three class \u2013 three-ship class and our close relationship with the Navy has been important in all of us working together to get this war fighting battle start out to the fleet. Carter Copeland : Thanks a lot. Erin Linnihan : Okay. Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Dynamics' Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. As is obvious from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.28 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.99 billion and income from continuing operations of $733 million. This is $0.23 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $243 million, or 3.1%; operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.5% increase; and income from continuing operations is up $39 million, a 5.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.034 billion reflects 12.9% operating margin, consistent with the 12.9% operating margin of third quarter 2014. By the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion. Sequentially, revenue is up $112 million, or 1.4%, operating earnings are down $47 million, and operating margin is down 80 basis points. Recall, however, that last quarter's earnings included a gain on the sale of our Cyber commercial security business. Excluding that gain, the operating earnings for the quarter are rather similar. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $1.17 billion, a 5.2% increase. Operating earnings are up $320 million, a very strong 11.3% increase. And operating margins are up 80 basis points, once again, reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. With respect to cash, we had $652 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter; that is 89% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.81 billion year-to-date, 82% of net income from continuing operations. You may recall that we received significant advance payments on international orders last year and on commercial shipbuilding orders the year before. That cash is being deployed this year and next as we have previously advised you. We are also hampered by OWC growth at Gulfstream, which is the natural result of building test articles in pre-production buildup of parts and wings for the G500 and G600. All of the foregoing makes performance at 100% of net income this year and next problematic. In the quarter, we repurchased 7.15 million shares for over $1 billion. We have purchased approximately 19.3 million shares year-to-date for about $2.7 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance to you that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts in excess of this year's free cash flow. To help you size that, we have spent $3.380 billion on share repurchases and dividends year-to-date compared to free cash flow of $1.81 billion. That is a delta of $1.57 billion. That delta is likely to grow in the fourth quarter. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was a good intake of orders in all segments other than the Marine group where we have received several multi-year orders in prior quarters. The Marine group has the largest backlog of all of our operating segments. We ended the quarter with total backlog for the company of $68.7 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Let me say a few words about each of our businesses, business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue, earnings and margin are all up from the year-ago quarter, as well as for the first nine months of the year. The group reported sales of $2.34 billion, up from the third quarter of 2014 by $54 million, or 2.4%. This represents the group's highest-ever revenue quarter. Operating earnings increased $15 million, or 3.6%, to $426 million on an operating margin of 18.2%, a 20-basis point improvement on the year-ago quarter. By the way, this is the fifth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million. On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, but was nevertheless better than our expectations in guidance to you. We had good order intake in the group at 0.8 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollar value of orders and 0.9 to 1 in number of units sold. The distribution of the orders is also attractive with the G650 and G650ER leading the way. Only four of the orders were for models not yet in production. Much like the automobile industry, general business aviation market is increasingly North America-focused with particularly strong interest from Fortune 500 companies. However, the G650 continues to see activity even in areas experiencing political or economic challenges. We had G650 orders from China, Japan, Brazil and Eastern Europe in the quarter. Our pipeline of projects and active sales discussions are good, so we are reasonably optimistic about order intake for the fourth quarter. Next Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter, with revenue of $1.35 billion, operating earnings of $218 million, and a really strong 16.2% operating margin. However, margins are off somewhat against the third quarter 2014, when we enjoyed an operating margin that was 40 basis points higher. Compared to third quarter 2014, revenue was off $50 million and earnings were off $14 million. Importantly, however, year-to-date revenue was flat against 2014; operating earnings are up $57 million, or 9.6%; and operating margin is at 15.7%, up 130 basis points. Combat Systems remains on course for a very strong year. The Marine group's revenue is higher than 2014, both for the third quarter and for the first nine months. Revenue in the quarter is up by $267 million, a 14.7% increase to $2.09 billion. Year-to-date revenue has increased by $759 million, or 14.4%, to over $6 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs, both construction, repair and engineering, and to a lesser degree, commercial ship construction activity. This is the strongest revenue quarter ever for the Marine group. Operating earnings at $181 million are up modestly compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter and 50 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift and a one-time charge at NASSCO on a warranty item in the quarter. However, margins for the first nine months of the year remain a respectable 9.2% and should improve a bit in the fourth quarter. And finally IS&T. They continue to outperform our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.2 billion is off $28 million against last year's quarter, but up $113 million, or 1.7% year-to-date. Recall that we had initially expected a 5.5% revenue decline for the year, and instead, we are up almost 2%. Operating earnings of $219 million are up $17 million, or 8.4%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 90-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, operating earnings are up $100 million, a 17.5% increase on 130-basis point improvement in operating margins. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margin higher than expected. So what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate, and somewhat lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.20. Our guidance goes from a range of $8.70 to $8.80 to a range of $8.90 to $9. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for some more details. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a couple of things to cover before we start the Q&A period. As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility this year than we have in the past. Still not material in the aggregate, but it's having a negative impact on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue was held steady over the first nine months compared with last year, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group sales would have been up by 8% year-to-date. As Combat Systems shifts away from a heavy reliance on U.S. military sales to an increasing level of international activity, we'd expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to be a part of the group's story. Moving onto interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $21 million in the third quarter of 2014. The slight increase is due to lower interest income as we've deployed over $1 billion this year from the balance sheet towards share repurchases and dividend payments. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net debt position at just about break even, a total of $41 million debt in excess of cash. This compares to a net cash balance of about $660 million at the end of the second quarter. And that change, again, is due to the capital deployment activity in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter, lower than we expected as a result of increased international earnings as well as favorable contract closeouts and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, reflecting our favorable performance to date, we now expect an effective tax rate closer to 28%. We funded our pension plans as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2015 to be approximately $185 million. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open. Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jason. Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Phebe, thanks for the additional detail and color in your opening remarks. It's very helpful. I just had one quick follow-up question though on some of the comments that you made around the book-to-bill. At Gulfstream, with regard to value versus units, it sounds like the number of units were a little bit better than the value. And then you followed on with some positive commentary about the G650. So wondering if you could dive in a little bit more about the difference between the two and what that might say about the pricing environment that you're seeing today for particularly the G450 and G550. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it was largely the difference between the two book-to-bill calculations is really about mix, and let me give you, let me take this opportunity, I think, to give you a little bit of color and detail and I'll parse for you sort of the demand picture, because I think I want you all to understand the demand signals in their totality. So what I'm going to talk to you about is what we have seen so far this year. And I think this context is important. First, Gulfstream continues to perform well in the market. This was our strongest third order intake in the last four years. And by the way, it follows the strongest second quarter intake that we had in seven years last quarter. Second, our North American sales activity remains good. And this quarter we saw some resurgence in the international market. Interestingly, with about half of our orders coming from ex-U.S., Asia, Pacific Rim, Australia, Latin America, Mideast. So nice broad order interest and order activity. Third our book-to-bill, as you noted, is wholesome. And fourth, and I think this is also important to recall and understand, our firm backlog for this quarter is $13.6 billion. That's right around the median of our backlog total for three years. So what does that mean? It means that the backlog has been remarkably stable. And by the way, recall that our orders come with good deposits and strong contract terms, so they're rather sticky. So let me give you a little bit of color going forward. Our pipeline is good, as it's been all year. And if you're interested in the piece parts constituents of the pipeline, it's heavily North American which is wholesome. Public, private companies, high net worth individuals. And these are sophisticated buyers, who're interested in fleet replacement and augmentation. So I think as context, that gives you a little bit of color on what we're seeing. Now, with all of that said, there are some non-macro headwinds. We had a competitor with white tails in the G450 and G550 space at very low prices. There are also five to six pre-owned G550s on the market that are less than five years old. And these newer planes are still under warranty. And for some customers, they can be competitive with our new offerings. So with all of that said, we remain pretty cautiously optimistic. I think I gave you a little bit more there, but I wanted you to understand how we're seeing the entire market, because I think it's important to see it in its totality. Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Phebe, you talked about the disconnect between cash generation and cash deployment. And consistently in the past it's been 100% of conversion. And you teed up the 2015 and 2016 explanation thereof. So I'm just curious : how much of the deployment this year \u2013 I think that you said somewhere around $3.3 billion year-to-date \u2013 is deployed and presumably there'd be more of that in the fourth quarter. How much of that is indicative of what you think free cash flow is once you get through this kind of negative headwind you're seeing in 2015 and 2016? Is that the underlying cash generative base of business that you see out in the 2017, 2018 period of time? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, to the extent that I think that can fully understand your question, we will give you more color on 2016, as we always do, in January of that year. But I'll try to give you some context for 2015 and 2016 and not beyond that, what we see in terms of the cash headwinds. We have those international deposits that we're deploying, as you would expect. And we're building our operating working capital, also as you would expect if you think about it at Gulfstream. So that all flushes out at the end of 2016. So if the essence of your question is there any structural cash generation issue at our company, the answer is no (17:37). Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: By 2017 you see it largely resolved back to the kind of the GD of old, the 100% conversion? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a clarification. Jason, the tax rate contribution of $0.20 was how much of the raise? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So it was $0.05 impact in the quarter. And as I mentioned, I think we're expecting closer to 28% tax rate for the year. So you can do the math on what that does to the fourth quarter. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick one on IS&T. Obviously, the results there have been much better than you expected. I wondered if you might give us some color on where you're seeing the strength and break out the more traditional service-oriented offerings versus the product-oriented offerings. And maybe comment on the cost structure and your efforts there and what impact that's having. Just a little bit more color on the successes you've been having there. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so this is a good news story for us. And it's across both Mission Systems and Information Technology. They both had a strong quarter, and they're improving their performance year-to-date. And there is no single area that's driving strength, given the number of programs that we have in that portfolio. There is just constant flux in mix and timing. They have been, but because of their decreased cost structure, they've been winning more than their fair share. So that has added nicely to our book-to-bill which I think year-to-date is about 1-to-1. And those short cycle businesses, that's pretty impressive. So I think it's operating excellence, technical ability, and just focus. So we're very pleased with what they've done. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I wanted to get back to Gulfstream. And just two things to understand. One, you've talked in the past about potentially moving forward some G650 production, perhaps adding some in the nearer-term which would help the revenue top-line. Can you comment on that? And then also, where does availability stand on the G450 and G550 now in terms of months ahead? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me take them in the inverse order. The G450 and G550 are about three to four quarters. So not much of a change there. With respect to the G650, our production is as we anticipated this year. So no changes to that. But going forward, as we prepare our plan for next year, we'll look to feather in a couple of, and I'm talking about one and two, just a handful \u2013 onesies and twosies \u2013 feather in some G650s to help offset as we make that transition to entering into service on the new airplane. So that's pretty much what we've been seeing all year and saying is exactly what we're continuing to see. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So Phebe, if you could give us some color on how the flight test program is going, because it's kind of hard to follow as an outsider. What milestones are happening? And if you could just kind of paint a picture for that. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So our flight test program is going very well. On the G550 we have surpassed G500. We've surpassed more than 100 hours of flight, and we've successfully completed about, I think, 45 missions. On the G600, we've begun construction and is well underway on construction on the test aircraft. And we plan to fly that in 2016. And our entry into service remains unchanged. So going very, very well. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just as a quick follow-on, is there any chance that, that entry into service could happen a little earlier if kind of everything just continues to go smooth? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's hard to predict since we don't, but I'm not going to get out ahead of Gulfstream. We're sticking right now to what our original entry into service is. And as we go and we mature and get down the test flight program, we'll have a little bit more clarity. But right now that's what we still see. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Arment (22:47) with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Yes. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Unknown Speaker : Can you give us an update on your general thoughts of the latest talk on the budget deal, if there's any material impact in terms of your overall plan and just regarding, in particular, regarding Combat? It seems like the mix there continues to favor the margin performance. If you could just update how we see the mix going forward. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the budget \u2013 the prospective budget, agreement would be very welcome news I think from a national security perspective. And certainly for us our programs are fully funded in the President's request and as we understand the proposed budget agreement. So I think that's some very, very good progress made quickly. So we're pleased with that and we would encourage and hope that, that continues since \u2013 we're hopeful that, that's all on track. And on Combat, we are continuing. It's between, last year and this year, we've had some mix issues as we came off of mature programs that were in development and at the end of their production runs and started up on a whole series of new programs. But that backlog, and that coupled with the operating excellence of that entire group, positions us quite well for nice earnings growth. And margins should increase over time. If you think about that business as we've got our platform businesses, but we also have our Ordnance and Tactical Systems business. And they had an absolutely terrific quarter. So they are highly focused on their cost structure, operating leverage, and they had a very wholesome book-to-bill in excess of 1-to-1. So for a short cycle business that's very, very good. Unknown Speaker : Appreciate it. Thank you, Phebe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. I wanted to go back to Marine and the strength there. You talked about it before \u2013 submarine driven. Is this a sustainable revenue rate quarterly, Phebe, as we go forward here? It sounds like... Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, think about the submarines in two ways. We're at our \u2013 this will be steady state on Virginia Block IV revenues. So what we're seeing now will continue. And we will continue to see and anticipate growth in the Ohio Replacement design work, which has been growing at a very healthy clip. And the growth will slow down but it will continue to grow. So that business is very well positioned for additional revenue increases. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And you see the margins coming back up into the 9%s? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I do. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I wanted to ask Myles' question again maybe from a different direction. The buy-back and the dividends exceeding free cash flow this year, do you think that's something that we should expect again next year? And do you have a sort of leverage target in mind? You've gone back to sort of net debt to cash of basically zero. But do you see it actually moving to a net debt situation going forward? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So I think one way to think about it is we would never view a net cash position as being optimal and even a break even situation is not optimal. I don't necessarily think we'd characterize as having a target leverage position. So much as we think about having the preservation of the strong balance sheet that allows us to be poised to quickly and readily take a strategic direction when the opportunity presents itself. And as far as capital deployment goes, I'll look at my boss and say I'm not going to speak to our plans for next year and get out ahead of her. But you know where we are today is trying to normalize that deployment of capital to a net income level given that we see free cash flow being somewhat less than net income this year. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And maybe a quick follow up, Jason, as well. On the foreign exchange you mentioned this is something we should watch. What's your hedging situation? Do you have most of these export revenues hedged? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So yeah, two parts to answer that question : from the perspective of actual economic exposure in having a foreign currency revenue or expense item in a particular business, we have about 100% hedged and we're totally secure on that front. What I'm referring to strictly is the translation of our indigenous businesses in Spain, in the U.K., in Canada and so on translating those operating results back into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. So it's not an economic loss we're talking about. It's a headwind from a U.S. consolidated reporting perspective. But from an actual economic exposure standpoint we're very comfortably hedged. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So I think some of the wait times, if not all of them by your aircraft platform at Gulfstream actually increased a little bit last quarter including G450 and G550, both the CBs. You've indicated there is some headwinds there in that market right now \u2013 call it cross winds, if you will, from obviously a competitor. The question is have you actually scaled back on G450 production at all this year as it relates to the next couple of years of rate? And can you remind us what the wait time is for the G650 right now? Thanks a lot. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So our production for this year is exactly on track. No changes. We're in the process of setting our production rates for next year and we'll give you that color when we report fourth quarter and give you guidance. And the G650 actually, we are one or two slots away from moving to a second quarter of 2018 availability. So that backlog, as wholesome as it is, continues to grow. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I want to go back to the same question I guess in terms of the free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think about when you first came in, Phebe, you talked about the M&A organization as being broken and needed to be fixed. And I guess I'm wondering why we haven't seen you make more actions there? Is it the budget outlook? Is it the prices? Is it that you see more value in the stock? Just what would make you change your view towards buyback and start thinking about acquisition? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, so far, we've seen nothing to particular note that's interesting at accretive prices. So I think that's the best way to think about it. We're really not looking because there isn't much out there, from our perspective. So we just continue to keep our powder dry and you'll continue to see us through the course of the year buy back shares as it makes sense tactically. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And if I can follow up, is there any way you can size the warranty issue at NASSCO? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. It had to do with a bearing on a drive shaft. And that's to the extent of which I understand the shipbuilding challenge there. But we took the warranty and NASSCO is, we took the charge and NASSCO is all set to, it is poised to recover for next quarter. So that was a one-time event, and it's in our rear view mirror. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Hi, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : It'll be a little bit like trying to pull teeth here, but we'll see if I can succeed. Your outlook for Gulfstream. They've continued to surprise you, and yet you're being conservative about the fourth quarter. Could you elaborate a little bit more on some of the challenges? Is it higher R&D? Is it mix? Is it something else that causes you some concern about profitability? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the fourth quarter is going to be lighter than the third quarter. And let me take you back to last quarter when we talked about Jet Aviation and that we were going to see some margin compression in the second half as we began to spend on engineering in the pre-production activities at Basel that we need to do in anticipation of the start of production which begins early next year. That has happened and it will continue into next quarter. So couple that with you've got a higher R&D and lower launch assistance. And that's essentially the story from where we sit right now. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Did you pull any teeth? Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : No, I'm not going to try too hard because you've been pretty consistent and doing a reasonable job there. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Phebe, I'm going to try and follow on to Howard's question. For the margin at Gulfstream to only be 18.5% for the year, it requires the fourth quarter to be down like 16.5% or something. Why would it get that low? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as I told you, we're seeing a significant margin compression at Jet. And I think that if you back in the math, it's fourth quarter, maybe somewhere around 18%. Yeah. So Jet is a factor. Our R&D spend is going to be higher. There's really nothing other than that. There's nothing structural, if that's what you're getting at. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : What's R&D going be relative to the third quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Up. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. I'm sure you won't quantify it, but I'll let you go with that. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Phebe, on the G500 could you talk about order interest there, ex the initial fleet buyers that came in for that airplane when you announced it? And then one question about your comments on free cash flow conversion as we head into next year. Are you assuming that advances we see a further draw down on the advances side into 2016? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, on your latter question. And on the G500 and G600, customer interest has been good. And we expect that interest and demand increase as we progress through the development program and we, frankly, get closer to EIS. So this is an attractive airplane set for our customers. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Phebe, just looking at Combat just given the strong order flow over there the past 18 months or so and the FX pressure that you're seeing this year, what's the growth for that segment look like next year? Some of the international contracts flowing through but just being offset by FX and does that annualize next year? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as you would expect, we took in a large number of orders into the backlog in 2014 and if you look at the engineering cycle and typically when programs start production, you could reasonably expect that production to begin in 2016 and I think we've been pretty clear about that. But I don't want to get into any more detail on what 2016 looks like until we finish our plan. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning. Notwithstanding what you just said about not getting into 2016, I was wondering if you could comment on how the profitability headwind from Jet carries over for \u2013 in Aerospace from Jet Aviation \u2013 carries over from Q4 into 2016 since you've got some pretty tough margin comps in the first half of the year? The Gulfstream margin was around 20%. And I thought that the cost management in Aerospace was one of the ways to help manage this transition from the G550, G450 to the G500, G600? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, your supposition is right. Cost management is going to be key. The margin compression that we've seen in Jet reverses in the first quarter of 2016 as they begin production. Right now, they're simply in the dueling phase and engineering for these large body and narrow body airline completions. So that's a fair amount of engineering work. We'll get into production then starting in the first quarter of next year. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So that headwind is behind us. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : And Nicole, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, nice quarter, guys. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Phebe, there was some press during the quarter about Bath on the DDG-1000. Could you give us your thoughts on that program? Just how it's going and if there's any financial risk going forward related to that? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so let me talk a little bit about DDG-1000. As we've said before this is a highly complex and revolutionary surface combatant. The first of which \u2013 we've got three in our backlog and three under construction \u2013 the first of which is nearing C trial. So we are continuing to work with the Navy to resolve O&E developmental issues that they see. And I think we all agree that we're working through all of those technical challenges on this first ship. And by the way, I think the bellwether that we used to think about performance on that ship is, you may recall that the complete redesign of the deckhouse on the third ship was reassigned to us, that design is nearly complete and construction is proceeding quite nicely. So that suggests considerable learning and I'm very pleased with at least that performance there. We do have some risks going forward. We'll manage that accordingly. We're working very closely with the Navy and Navy's other subcontractors on this program. But let me give you some sense of magnitude : Bath is 1/32nd of our sales so we are paying quite a bit of attention to what is a complex warship, but I think the context is important here. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thanks so much. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Well, thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Abigail, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erin, and good morning, all. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operation of $2.40 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.81 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $764 million. Incidentally, we beat analyst consensus by $0.02, which is hard to do this late in the year. Revenue and operating earnings were down against the year-ago quarter by 6.6% and 2.9% respectively. Earnings from continuing operations, however, were up $27 million on the strength of a 50-basis-point improvement in operating margin and a lower tax rate. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.21, almost 10%. By the way, in connection with the comparisons to the year-ago quarter, let's remember that the fourth quarter 2014 was and remains the strongest revenue performance of any quarter in the last four years and by no small measure. So it is a very difficult comparison. And that will be true in the business segments as well. Sequentially, the quarters were very similar. Revenue was down $185 million or 2.3%, but operating earnings were up $2 million on a 40-basis-point improvement in margin rate. So all in all, a solid quarter with particularly good performance in the Aerospace group, which I'll speak about in a little bit more detail. So, for the year, where does that leave us? We had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.08 on revenue of $31.47 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.97 billion. Return on sales was 9.4%. Revenue for the year was up $617 million or 2%. Operating earnings were up $289 million or 7.4% on a 70-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $292 million or 10.9% helped by a 200-basis-point improvement in the effective tax rate. This, together with share repurchases activity led quite naturally to a 16% improvement in earnings per share. So all in all, 2015 was a great year, improving significantly over a very good 2014. It was a year of further progress from an operating perspective and revenue growth consistent with our guidance to you at this time last year. Turning to cash. Free cash flow from operations was $120 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.93 billion, which is 65% of earnings from continuing operations. As we advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to reach 100% of net earnings for three reasons. First, we are working off the very large advanced payments received in 2014 on a major Combat Systems program. Second, we have an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream consistent with building numerous aircraft for test and preproduction parts in connection with the G500 and G600 program. And third, we were also working off large advanced payments received in 2014 at NASSCO for commercial shipbuilding programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, but not until 2017. In 2016, we will continue to have less than our usual robust free cash flow. Let me give you some color on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First, Aerospace, revenue was down modestly over the year-ago quarter. Sales were down $98 million, but earnings were down just $2 million as a result of a 70-basis-point improvement in margin; very nice operating performance. For the year, revenue was $8.85 billion and operating earnings were $1.71 billion with an operating margin of 19.3%. This is a year-over-year improvement of 2.3% on sales, 5.9% on earnings, and 70 basis points on operating margin. All in all, a very good year at Aerospace with strong operating leverage and good order intake. During the quarter, we took down the production rate of the G550 to what will be the sustaining rate through 2016. The G450 will come down modestly in the first quarter of 2016. By the same token, the production rate of the G650 and G650ER were taken up during the second half of 2014 and will be taken up again in 2016 to reflect current demand and our sizable backlog. The production rate on the G650 and G650ER is clearly sustainable for this year and next. So, contrary to what many investors seem to have anticipated, order activity in the quarter was quite good. The book-to-bill at Gulfstream was at least one to one, both dollar base, one to one, and in units of green delivery, 1.1 to 1, with particularly strong demand for the G650 and G650ER. By the way, an interesting data point is that there were more orders for in-production aircraft in 2015 than 2014. All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. Let me say a few words about the large-cabin business jet market in general. We find demand to be reasonable. We see no evidence at Gulfstream of a cyclical decline. The order activity is good, but not frenetic, and North America is particularly good. More than 50% of our orders for the year were from North America. I should also point out that, despite the hand-wringing by some, our orders from Asia Pacific improved by more than 60% over 2014. In short, this market is not ebullient, but it is steady from our perspective. We also seem to be picking up some share from other OEMs. Combat Systems. Combat revenue was down $90 million, or 5.6%, and earnings were down $37 million, or 13.7%, on a 140-basis-point reduction in operating margin over the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, a 15.4% operating margin was more than respectable and consistent with our expectations for the group. Sequentially, the story begins to foretell the future. Sales were up $179 million and earnings were up $16 million. That is 13.3% and 7.3%, respectively. For the full year, sales were down $92 million, or 1.6%, and earnings were up $20 million, or 2.3%, on a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margin. This margin expansion is the result of restructuring at both our European and Ordnance and Tactical Systems businesses. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. You may recall that we had guided to flat revenue and earnings. Overall, Combat Systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. By the way, in just a moment, Jason's going to give you a little bit more color on this group's revenue performance. This is a business poised for modest growth in 2016 and quite significant growth in the 2017 through 2019 timeframe as we begin delivering on our $19 billion backlog. Now, Marine Systems. The group's revenue of $1.98 billion in the quarter was down $58 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, and down $105 million, or 5%, sequentially. Revenue for the year, however, was up $701 million, a rather extraordinary 9.6%. And recall that this increase in annual revenue follows a $600 million increase in 2014. Operating earnings were down $21 million, or 10.9%, against the year-ago quarter, and down $9 million, or 5%, sequentially. For the full year, earnings were up $25 million, or 3.6%, despite a 50-basis-point decline in operating margin. In the Marine Group, we guided you at this time last year to revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, which we exceed by a fair measure. We forecasted margins at 9.5% and wound up at 9.1%. So the story here was better-than-anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin, which left us relatively consistent with our guidance for operating earnings. The growth in revenue in the year was driven by Electric Boat on two Virginia-class construction, sub \u2013 two Virginia-class submarine construction and increased engineering work for the Ohio Replacement Program. This group's margins are the result of a mix shift; higher engineering work transitioning to Block IV from Block III and increased work on commercial Jones Act ships at NASSCO. IS&T is a business group where, once again, we saw less-than-expected revenue decline coupled with improved operating performance. Several of our major ground and maritime programs were all funded beyond our plan, improving our sales performance. Margin improvement was the result of greater efficiencies than planned in business unit consolidation and continuing operating performance across all the portfolio. Revenue in the quarter was $2.16 billion, down $307 million, or 12.4%, against the year-ago quarter, a very difficult comparator as I had mentioned previously. On the other hand, operating earnings of $230 million in the quarter were 8.5% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $11 million, or 5%, on the strength of 10.6% margins, 70 basis points better than last quarter. For the year, revenue was down $194 million or only 2.1%. Remember, this is dramatically less than the 5.5% revenue decline we forecasted in our guidance to you at this time last year. For the year, earnings were up $118 million or 15%; very good operating performance in the face of a 2% revenue decline. On this call a year ago, I gave you guidance with respect to operating margins in this \u2013 in the 9% range, which we beat by 110 basis points. All-in-all, we beat forecasted revenue and operating margin. When that happens, the result is significant upside to the forecast. On this call a year ago, on a company-wide basis, our guidance for 2015 was to expect revenue of $31.3 billion to $31.5 billion, an operating margin rate of 12.8%, a tax rate of 30.5%, and a return on sales of 8.7%. We wound up the year with revenue at $31.47 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3%, an effective tax rate of 27.7%, and a return on sales of 9.4%. Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $8.05 to $8.10. We wound up at $9.08. About 46% of the improvement came from better-than-planned operating performance, $0.05 from the gain on the sale of a small business, $0.30 from a lower-than-planned tax rate, and the balance from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly a great year by any measure. So let me provide some thoughts about 2016, initially by group and then on a company-wide roll-up. In Aerospace we expect revenue to be approximately $8.9 billion, up very modestly. Margin rate should be down 10 basis points to 20 basis points and operating earnings flat to last year. 2017 should look a lot like 2016 with upside in revenue and earnings if we can deliver the G500 in the fourth quarter. Revenue and earnings growth will resume with full scale production and delivery of the G500 in 2018 (13:59) and the G600 the following year. In Combat, we expect revenue to be up $160 million and the margin rate similar to 2015 with more vigorous growth of both revenue and earnings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Marine group is expected to have revenue similar to 2015 but improved operating earnings as a result of operating margins in the mid-9% range. Revenue in 2017 and 2018 will have growth of a couple of hundred million a year, an additional $0.5 billion in 2019 growth. Finally in IS&T we expect a modest improvement in revenue and a 20 basis point to 30 basis point decline in operating margin that remind you again that a gain on the sale of a business was included in 2015's operated earnings and margin rate. This will result in essentially flat operating earnings year-over-year. Once again, we should see more solid revenue growth in 2017 and 2018. All of this rolls up to $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion of revenue, operating margin of around 13.3%, and return on sales of roughly 9.1%. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 29.5% tax rate, and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercise. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of around $9.20 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $8.05 to $8.10 at the same time on the same basis. Let me also reconcile this forecast of $9.20 to our 2015 year-end result at $9.08. In 2016 we will not have the operating gain from the sale of a business. That gain was $0.05 of EPS. In 2016, we will have higher interest expense with a $0.02 negative impact to 2016 EPS. We will also have a higher effective tax rate in 2016 that will cost us $0.23 per share. Foreign exchange headwinds at current FX rates will cost another $0.04 of EPS compared to 2015. On a pro forma basis, this suggests 2015 to $8.74 and gives us a 5% adjusted growth in forecasted 2016 EPS before deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it looks like most years. So divide our guidance by four, then take $0.20 off of Q1, $0.10 off Q2, leave Q3 even, and about $0.30 up in Q4. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the deployment of capital, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2016 for dividends and share repurchase. While we don't anticipate a robust year from a free cash flow perspective for the reasons I have previously described, we will use balance sheet cash to some degree to supplement our free cash flow for share repurchase activity. I'll have more to say on this subject at the end of the first quarter as our planning becomes more refined and is approved by our board. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. As we discussed previously, we felt more of an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility in 2015 than we have in the past. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our Combat Systems group given their increasing international activity. As Phebe pointed out, the group's full-year revenue was down 1.6% compared to 2014. But had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and to the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2014 to this year, the group's sales would have actually increased by 6.4% in 2015. For the company as a whole this would have taken our 2% top line growth over 2014 to almost 4%. As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. This is merely the translation of our various international indigenous businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, and the negative effect on that translation that comes with a strengthening dollar. Given where we see the mix of Combat Systems programs in the years ahead, we expect foreign currency fluctuations to be an ongoing part of the group's story. Net interest expense in the quarter was $19 million, consist with the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, interest expense was $83 million, $3 million less than the year before due to the repayment of $500 million of fixed rate notes that occurred in 2015. For 2016 we expect net interest expense of around $95 million. And the increase is due primarily to less interest income as we've deployed cash off the balance sheet. As we've deployed that cash over the year, we've moved from a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion at the end of 2014 to a net debt position of $614 million. And I'll walk through those capital deployment activities in just a minute. Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the year, right in the ballpark, slightly lower than the 28% we forecasted at the end of the third quarter. The lower outcome is attributable to favorable contract closeouts with the IRS and Congress' enactment of tax extenders in late December; in particular, the research and experimentation credit. For the year, the research tax credit extension benefited our rate by about 50 basis points, but was offset by some one-time unfavorable effects of other provisions in the extenders law. The combined effect was a 20-basis-point reduction in the 2015 effective rate, or about $0.02 per share. You may recall at this time last year that, given our increasing international presence, we considered the new normal for our effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 30.5% range. For 2016 with the research tax credit now permanent, we expect an effective tax rate in the mid-29% range. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $185 million to our pension plans in 2015, as forecast. And for 2016, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. And finally on the capital deployment front, to summarize our activities for the year, we spent approximately $3.2 billion on share repurchases; and when you combine those share repurchases with our dividend payments, we used $4.1 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2015 or 2.1 times our free cash flow from operations for the year. Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Abigail, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT : Yes. Good afternoon, Phebe and Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good afternoon. Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT : Phebe, maybe this is a good opportunity just since we haven't spoke since the budget deal, and maybe you could just give us your overview how you see that impacting domestically? And also, related to that, are you seeing any changes on the international order front just given what has happened with the oil prices with any of your customers? Thanks, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the budget deal provided us funding in line with \u2013 exactly in line with what we anticipated, so no surprises there; and some upside, frankly, in a couple of areas. But that stability is critical and, I think, very helpful as we think through the defense portfolio for the next year or two. So that was, I think, very helpful. But as I said, it was consistent with what we had anticipated. With respect to international orders, we have continued to increase \u2013 and particularly on the Combat Systems side, increase our order activity internationally. And so far, we have yet to see any impact from oil prices in the Mid-East. You know, as we've talked a lot in the past, from my perspective, defense spending is completely determined by the threat. And the threat environment in that world has gotten nothing but worse. So we're very sensitive to our customers' needs and requirements. And we work carefully with them to ensure that we can provide them what they need when they want it and terms that are favorable to us and which they can accommodate. I would also remind you, by the way, that most of our orders in that part of the world are government to government, which provides some stability. So that is a benefit to us as well as we look forward. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. You had talked a little bit about free cash flow not being that robust this year. And you had talked about last \u2013 I guess, in 2015 because of the Aerospace investments. Can you just walk through what kind of expectations and then what changes as you go into 2017 that makes it start to see us return to 100% conversion? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's all three. It's a reversal, an unwinding of all three of the factors that we've talked about impacting 2015 and 2016, but let's take Gulfstream. We're continuing to build demonstration and test aircraft, test aircraft for both the G500 and G600. Our capital deployment \u2013 or our CapEx is largely done at Gulfstream, but that buildup in inventory will continue until we begin to take \u2013 or deliver the G500 and G600. So that will help unwind that buildup of working capital at Gulfstream. NASSCO will have completed its Jones Act ships in 2017. And then we anticipate a number of orders coming into the Marine group that, of course, carry cash. And in Combat Systems, we will begin to get additional cash as we ramp up to full-rate production on a number of our international orders. So 2015, 2016, lighter than we're used to. But 2017, it'll be above; every expectation we have is it'll be above 100% of net income. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Any way to quantify what percentage of net income you're expecting this year? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It'd be about similar to last year. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Think about cash similar to last year. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Phebe, on Gulfstream, can you just talk about what you're expecting actually for the actual number of large cabin deliveries you're expecting in 2016? And then can you talk about what the reducing rate on the G450 and G550, what that's done to shrink or to expand the lead time? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let me take those in inverse order. We've been reducing the G450 very immaterially for the last about seven or eight quarters, so in line again with what we saw in demand and what we predicted in demand. And as to be expected, we reduced the G550 production rate in the fourth quarter, again, in line with demand. Our wait times are essentially the same, three to fourth quarters in those lines of business. In 2016, you asked about what are our production and delivery \u2013 what are our delivery targets in our plan. Large cabin about 104, medium cabin 34. That compares to 2015, large cabin of 112 and medium cabin of about \u2013 mid cabin about 35. So down eight large and one medium cabin, with a better mix, I might add. And that's what you would expect, a better mix as we enter this year of transition, more G650s, fewer G450s and G550s. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Phebe, Jason. I wanted to ask for just a follow-on to David's question just on the pricing environment. Then I had a more technical question on your share authorization. Last year you did this twice and you had one in December and mentioned there might be something coming at the end of Q1. Is twice the norm going forward? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me talk about the pricing environment. We have held our prices very consistently, and to the extent that others are having pricing pressure, it hasn't affected us materially. So I think that's the full and short answer to that question. Jason, you want to... Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ... share repurchases. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, the share repurchase authorization, so you're right. We did a total of $20 million authorized last year in two tranches. We got $10 million authorized late in the year by the board. Certainly wouldn't want to get out ahead of them in terms of the plans for the coming year but we'll address that as it comes. And as the opportunistic approach to share repurchase works down that current authorization, we'll see where it goes midway through the year. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): But there's no mechanical plan here that continues like this? There's nothing to it? It's just coincidental? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Exactly. It's coincidental. And as we said, as always, more of an opportunistic approach and we'll see where that takes us. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, George. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Phebe, the usual question I'll ask would go through. You had much better Gulfstream margin in the fourth quarter than the third even though the revenues were down. Maybe if you could explain a little more what happened there. And then going forward with G650s being up, I would think they probably have the highest margin at this point. So why would the margin deteriorate a little bit in 2016? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let me talk about revenue. As we noted before, we reduced the G550 rate for the fourth quarter. We had less preowned revenue than anticipated and somewhat less than anticipated service revenue. But Gulfstream was up and their backlog was up. Jet was down 5% in revenue and that was mix driven as we increased our engineering work in anticipation of the production work that we're starting this year. And we had lower FBO revenue because of fuel prices. We also had reduced business jet completions in St. Louis. So that sort of ties the bow on revenue. In margins, it's the same old stuff we always get, right? George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Right. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : From the usual suspects. We had mix shift. We had liquidated damages, launch assistant. And by the way, you quite rightly point out we had improved margins in the G650. So we anticipate roughly comparable margins. Those aren't what we (30:57) leading you to, guiding you to is \u2013 are not sufficient or significant material degradations in the margin rate. But what we are focused on and have been laser focused on and have been telling our investors for some time, we are going to keep earnings flat. And that's what we've signed up for and we see the path forward to clearly do that. Operator : Thank you. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. On IS&T, Phebe, about a year ago or so, I think you were \u2013 you sounded pleasantly surprised at how well IS&T was holding up, and it has held up quite well while others in some similar businesses have had a lot of issues. The backlog's down a little bit in this quarter. If you look inside that business and look forward and you separate into Mission Systems and GDIT, how do you see those two outlooks going now over the next couple years? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Let me talk a little bit about the book-to-bill. With the exception of the fourth quarters in 2014 and 2015, our IS&T book-to-bill has been approximately one to one every other quarter in both years. Q4 in those lines of businesses tends to be more of an issue, a timing issue than anything else. And we expect book-to-bill for 2016 about one to one. These are businesses that are performing extremely well and winning more than their fair share based on their ability to increase their operating leverage by decreasing costs, and their performance has been outstanding. So it's more of the same for them going forward. So ruthless dedication to cost cutting, operating performance, must perform on that backlog. And that then quite nicely leads to the kinds of book-to-bill that we've seen in these businesses. So I see that as more goodness to come. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Do you see Mission Systems and GDIT behaving somewhat differently? They have somewhat different drivers. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, they're different margin businesses. Mission Systems tends to be more heavily product oriented in nature, and product tends to carry higher margins. Our IT business is services; services have lower margins. But as I like to tell everybody, they got great cash performance. In fact, by the way, both of those businesses have a great cash performance. And with our services business, terrific return on invested capital. So there's no invested capital. But think about our information \u2013 our IT services businesses. When they go to market, they go to market in their core, and they are very competitive in their core both through past performance and cost competitiveness. So I like where they're positioned, and that hasn't changed for us. They continue to win and they're a big dog in the barnyard, not to make too many metaphors. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, or I guess good afternoon now. I wanted to follow up on Gulfstream for a second, and on the G650 in particular. Could you comment on where this skyline currently reaches to? And also a little bit on the pre-owned or, I guess, the available for sale G650s that are in the market and at what point do you see that as being more of a threat to production, because there's always going to be a battle of if the like-new starts to approach price points of your aircraft coming off the line? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen and don't anticipate seeing any impact from the planes that are in the used market. It really hasn't impacted us at all, because the guidance of the demand for that airplane has been, and we believe will continue to be, very, very wholesome. Despite taking up our production rates slightly, we are still at first quarter 2018 first available. So that tells you that is a strong, sustainable backlog for a very powerful airplane. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. I want to turn to Marine for a moment, Phebe. There's a number of dynamics going on there. You have a new agreement at Bath. You've got a couple of new opportunities. And then, at the same time, you've been working through the Jones Act backlog. Could you describe a little bit of the working parts there and what might the Navy also do in terms of service going forward? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, yeah, let me talk about all three of those businesses and give you a little bit of color. We have achieved a very significant agreement with our partners, our workforce in Maine at Bath that will allow Bath to be increasingly competitive going forward in all of its competitions. And we're very proud of our workforce there, and we are very optimistic about our ability to compete on a going-forward basis. So I like what I see at Bath. And by the way, you didn't ask, but on the DDG-1000, the first one is 98% done; so almost out the door. The second one's 84% done; and again, with the kinds of issues that you might expect on the first-of-class ships, but nothing that has been particularly surprising to us. The third ship, I think, is only about 40% done, but it has a deck house that we entirely designed and built, so that reduces the risk going forward. So I see the future for Bath very nice. At NASSCO, we are continuing to work off the backlog of Jones Act ships, as you quite rightly point out. There is, we believe, significant demand going forward because of the age of the fleet that has to be replaced for more Jones Act ships. Our experience in the Jones Act market is it's highly lumpy, but there is demand out there. And because of NASSCO's performance and because of its good cost structure, they have been very competitive in their Jones Act competitions and won a nice backlog; and we continue to believe we're going to add to that backlog. Their service business has been performing very, very nicely. The Navy is, what we believe, quite rightly moving to fixed price service contracts, and we know how to work those and we've been working closely with our Navy customers. So we like what we see in service, particularly out west in San Diego; little bit of lightness in the Norfolk area as the Navy re-jiggers some of its porting of some major ships, but we anticipate service to grow reasonably well on the surface ship side, single digit, low-single digit with a nice operating performance. We also anticipate additional submarine service at Electric Boat. Nothing too significant, but, again, right in our sweet spot. And, again, at Electric Boat, it's a story about Virginia and Ohio. Right? Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But I (39:10) think a once over of that entire portfolio. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much for the rundown. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, Phebe, Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I didn't know \u2013 just a quick clarification and a question. I didn't know if you mentioned the year-over-year impact from pension in that apples-to-apples comparison. If you could give us that, that'd be helpful as well. And then, just really appreciated the commentary on 2017, 2018, 2019. If you look \u2013 I know you talked about revenues in Marine and IS&T. And as you think about margins there, obviously, you talked about margins being up as part of the vigorous earnings growth in Combat. But when you look at potential for margins in the defense businesses in aggregate, and mainly IS&T and Marine, what's the outlook for those similar to the comments you made for Combat? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Let me have Jason ask the first part of your question on pension. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. And Carter, if I understand your question, you're talking about the sort of the walk forward on EPS from 2015 to 2016. And really when you think about our pension plans and our accounting for those plans, especially in the defense businesses, that is a muted effect in EPS. So it really just isolated to the commercial pension side which had a negligible effect. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yep. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I haven't calculated it, but it's nothing that would be materially... Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Extremely modest positive is what you're saying? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : There you go. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let's talk about the businesses. On a going-forward basis, we anticipate the IS&T group to be at around a 10% margin business. That may vary from quarter to quarter, or year to year depending on how much revenue the service business brings in. But for our foreseeable future that's about a 10% business. Combat, we see in the mid-15%, 15.5% pretty steady eddy. We may have, and we do, I believe, have margin expansion opportunity at the platform businesses. But remember, that will be somewhat offset by the short cycle business of OTS which we had terrific margins out of that business after we consolidated two units in 2014. With all things at defense, some of that goodness needs to go back to our customer, quite appropriately so. So that'll cause some margin compression for them. But from right now what we're planning for, for Combat, steady state 15%, 15.5% margin. We will, of course, strive for higher. And then the Marine group will be a 9.5% to 10% margin business depending on mix. As we've talked about before, performance at shipyards is, well performing shipyards, is all about the mix and we've got a number of mix shift issues which we've kind of articulated. But I think that gives you a sense of how we see our business going forward. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, Phebe, thanks so much, and good performance. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: So at Gulfstream I guess two issues. One is if you could give us any help in terms of where the R&D and launch aid is in your plan for 2016? And secondly I guess more importantly, you had a 7% layoff you announced in December. Maybe walk us through if there's any severance impact in the fourth quarter and the types of benefits you expect to realize from that in 2016. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me talk a little bit about the reduction, then I'll turn it over to Jason. We've been talking for the last year or so about this transition period from moving from the G450, G550 to G500 and G600. Well, we're in it now, and quite appropriately you would expect us to size for that. So our head count reductions were all about sizing appropriately for what we see in terms of revenue and our promise to keep margins, well, keep earnings flat year-over-year. So we did some pruning. Headcount reductions were just a part of our cost cutting effort as we improved our operating performance, took a fair amount of overhead out and touch labor. And we'll continue to do so, on a going-forward basis. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So on the R&D question, as you can imagine, the pace of that will sort of follow the cadence of the flight test program. So we expect that to pick up modestly in the next year and a little bit more in 2017 as we continue through that program. But I say modestly immaterially, still well within the range of our normal collar that we would normally expect R&D to flow in. Your question around the launch of systems payments, they'll continue to flow. I don't have the exact schedule of that, but it'll cause that quarterly amount to be lumpy as it's always been. And we'll report that to you when it gets out of line. But expect, net-net, a modest immaterial growth in R&D next year and then again the following year. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Just totally changing gears to the balance sheet. As you well know, right, the balance sheet's extraordinarily strong. Do you have any thoughts on maybe levering it up a little bit? Or what you think about that? Or what do you think the proper capital structure is for General Dynamics? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So I think consistent with the position we've held in the past is levering up really is not something we're interested in, particularly as it relates to our current capital deployment approach of share repurchase and dividends. Incurring debt for the proper long-term strategic opportunity is certainly out there, but that's something that we'll continue to hold as dry powder until that type of opportunity shows up. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : And, Abigail, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. To follow up actually from what Ron was asking, does this imply that the acquisition pipeline out there is not particularly attractive in your point of view? And maybe in relation to this, there's a little bit of stickiness going on in fed IT at the moment. Do you think this has any implications for you? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So fed IT, I think what you're seeing is \u2013 what we anticipate is seeing the same players just with new t-shirts on, new brands. In the pipeline, it is what it has been. And I think to Jason's point, it has always been our view that if we found something attractive and very accretive, we would lever up for it. But we haven't been there, and we don't see that as we stand in the moment. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in the broader portfolio, defense and Aerospace portfolio. Service, a little bit, but that's \u2013 I gave you my view of that. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks, Phebe. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Well, thank you for joining our call today. If you have any additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Morgan Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank Hunter Keay - Wolf Research Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the General Dynamics Q12016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operation Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Erin, please go ahead. Erin Linnihan : As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filing. I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks somewhat brief, since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward. I'll try to give you some of the more prosaic data up-front and then give you a little bit of color and insight from my perspective. The first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $2.34 per fully diluted share on revenues somewhat in excess of $7.7 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and earnings from continuing operations of $730 million. We beat analyst consensus by $0.18. We were also better than our previous guidance to you. The diluted weighted average share count was $312.3 million for the quarter, compared to consensus of about $315 million, which accounts for approximately $0.02 of the out-performance. I should note that at the same time a year ago, the diluted weighted share count was 22.4 million shares higher. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 29.9%, somewhat higher than anticipated. Therefore, almost all of the out-performance came from strong operating results, as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.6%. With respect to cash, we had $439 million net cash provided by operating activity. After capital expenditures of 65 million, we had $374 million of free cash flow from operations. The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter reflect, as you would imagine, the strong operating performance. Compared to first quarter 2015, revenue was down $60 million, less than 1%. However, our operating earnings were up $26 million, or 2.5% over the prior year's quarter on a strange of a 40-basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $85 million or 1.1%. but operating earnings were up $17 million on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of positive operating leverage. Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up 9.3% over the year ago quarter, as a result of better operation earnings and lower share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. So let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segment. First, Aerospace. Sales were down $121 million, compared to Q1, 2015, about 5.7%, and down $155 million sequentially against a strong fourth quarter. Earnings were down against the year ago quarter by $20 million, only 4.6% on a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. Operating earnings were up a million sequentially on 150 basis point improvement operating margin. Orders to the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders of 1.3 billion were 1.3 billion and the dollar book base book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we saw on the first quarter of 2012 through Q1 2015. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years, including 2016, is $1.35 billion, a book-to-bill of 0.5. So it was a quarter were the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened, part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. And I should also note that activity has been strong in April. So we are off to a good start in Aerospace, generally consistent with our guidance to you. We had previously guided to a modest increase in revenue, a modest decline in margins, and flat operating earnings for the year. We still believe we will be at flat operating earnings for the year, but with slightly lower revenue and somewhat higher margins. As a result of increased efficiency, we have been able to slip a few deliveries in the next year and still come out in the same place. Let me turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.13 billion was up $188 million or 9.7% compared to the year ago quarter, and up $149 million or 7.5% sequentially. Operating earnings were up $4 million or 2.1% against the year ago quarter, and up $20 million or 11.6% sequentially. We had particularly good performance at Electric Boat. Also at Electric Boat, the Navy announced its acquisition strategy for the $100 billion Ohio replacement program which designates EB as the prime contractor responsible for about 80% of the construction of new subs. The Navy also articulated a build strategy for the Virginia attack boat program during the same timeframe, and we find that very wholesome. Some of the more interesting comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, sales were down $90 million or 6.6%, largely due to timing, but earnings were up $13 million or 6.4% on a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin. The 17% operating margin is second only to the third quarter of 2013, in all the group's history. Sequentially, revenue was down $251 and operating earnings were down only $17 million on 160 basis point improvement in margins. This is a business that always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries. So this comparison is really quite wholesome. Also in the quarter, we began to transition from engineering into low rate production on two large international orders for Canada, the mid-east, and the U.K. vehicle programs. These programs will continue to grow through the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter with a one-to-one book-to-bill, all in all, extremely strong operating performance at Combat Systems. With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good performance in the group. Revenue in the quarter was down $37 million or 1.6% against a year ago quarter, and up $172 million sequentially. Operating earnings of $248 million in the quarter were $31 million more than the year ago quarter, up 14.3% on 140 basis point improvement in margins. Once again, nice operating leverage. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $18 million, or 7.8%, and margins were consistent with last quarter. The trend here is clearly in the right direction. I think it's important to note that IS and T backlog was $851 million in the quarter and the book-to-bill was $1.3 for the quarter, following the strong book-to-bill of one-to-one on average for the last three years. The last time the book-to-bill was higher was in Q3 of 2008. This represents a very wholesome win rate for these fast cycle businesses. So we are off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for many years, to give you a full review of our expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice is to say that we are ahead of the operating plan on which our guidance was based. We will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve performance. On a quarterly basis, we expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first in the nickel category. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. About a year ago we started talking about the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the resulting impact that foreign exchange rates had on our reported results, especially within Combat Systems. Remember we're referring to the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars rather than any economic harm to our contracts. This continues to be a factor in 2016, and in the first quarter, assuming stable exchange rates from the year ago period, our revenues in the Combat segment would have declined by 2.3% versus the 6.6% decline we reported. And for the company as a whole, first quarter revenue would have actually been up slightly from last year. Moving on to a few other income statement matters. We took a charge of $13 million in discontinued operations to record the final resolution of some outstanding items related to a disposition that closed last year. We don't expect any further activity in this area during the year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $21 million in the first quarter of 2015. On the capital deployment front, we expended just over a billion dollars on the repurchase of 7.8 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $1.2 billion in shareholder friendly actions during the first quarter. That's more than three times our free cash flow from operations, and we used a little bit of that balance sheet cash to do so. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains strong and reflects a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $1.5 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 29.9% for the quarter. While that was slightly higher than our full year forecast, we're still on course for a mid-29% tax rate for the full year. Erin that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan : Thanks Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Liz [ph], could you remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason M. Gursky with Citi. Jason Gursky : Hey. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, Jason. Jason Gursky : I was wondering if you could drive a little bit - good morning. I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the Aerospace business that you talked about, a revenue slip or a push out or maybe it was something that was driven on your own volition, but some sort of slip into next year on the revenue side. I'm wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on that. And then also just talk about the sustainability of the margins that we saw this quarter. Obviously continued to see some expansion there. Just wondering whether these are any kind of one time kinds of things or whether we're setting a new bar here for margins? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So let me talk a little bit about revenue and give you some insight into how we think about revenue and how we develop it with respect to Aerospace. We take revenue directly from the operating plan, and revenue in Aerospace is driven by a multitude of factors, as you would imagine, given the complexity of the business. Airplane green and completed deliveries, service volume and mix, which by the way can and do move across reporting periods. Pre-owned Jet Aviation Services and completion. So some of these are harder to predict because they have more estimating methodology embedded. For example, I think it's a pretty good one. Our plan has us selling between 10 to 14 pre-owned airplanes with revenue of $250 million at break-even margins. It's very difficult to forecast this. This quarter had one sale for $4 million, a good thing, but below our revenue estimate. On the other hand, the easiest factor to predict is airplane greens and completion deliveries because of the backlog of the 650. We have some other models to sell for delivery in Q4 but do not see that as a problem. As I told you, we're striving to keep our earnings flat for the year, and that's what we think is feasible. Jason Gursky : And are the sustainability of the margins going-forward? Phebe Novakovic : We're sticking with, you know, we're going to have slightly higher margins, as I said, because we're going to keep our earnings flat, and we're going to have slightly less revenue. So I think the margin you're going to see, as I noted some improvement, from what I guided you to which was about 19%. Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Ronald Epstein : Hey. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Hey, Ron. Ronald Epstein : So I think probably no big surprise, sort of the question that everybody's, you know, kind of thinking about is, what demand are you seeing on 650? How is that going? I mean, it's - I think it's no secret there's been some more 650's piling up in the available for sale market. Can you just give everybody your perspective on what's going on there? And how healthy that market is, or not. Just some color on that? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. Be happy to. So what I want to do is give you some facts instead of speculation. Think about it as firsthand intelligence, not second and third hand conjecture. So let me parse this in some specificity. First, sales activity, as I noted, in the quarter is similar to the quarter of last year. Our first quarter earnings were in line with all of our other prior years. In other words, we typically come off a strong fourth quarter, and orders this quarter were as anticipated, seasonably light. The pipeline, however, remains nicely active. I would note that the U.S. stock market fluctuations in that first quarter seemed to slow down some purchasing decisions, but our pipeline remains active. Today, we have the same competitive pressures that we've been dealing with for the last year, including overproduction of large cabin planes by others. So think about it this way. No change on that front. Demand for the 550 and 450 is in line with our expectations, and we continue to see interest in those planes, particularly the 550. The 650 is sold out for the year, and the first available ELS is about 24 months out. Remember, I think it's important to recall, but the 650 has 100% market share for a market it created, and from my perspective would appear to, I think it's safe to assume, or what I see, is that it's likely to remain in that position for the foreseeable future. It's still a hot plane and our demand is solid. The number of pre-owned 650's apparently on the market is higher than in the past, but to the best of our knowledge, we have not lost a single sale to pre-owned aircraft. So I've tried to parse for you sort of how we see it from the battlefield. And give you the facts by - by the, you know, the large cabin airplanes that we sell. Ronald Epstein : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Maybe just to follow-up on Ron's question may be slightly more broadly. What you're seeing out there on the Aerospace side in terms of regional variances, but I don't think has changed in the first quarter this year, and also more broadly, on the pricing of your product? Phebe Novakovic : Well, orders in the first quarter were 50% U.S., 30% Mid-Eastern Europe and 21% Asia Pacific, that goes everywhere from, and our region there is from Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, into China. Frankly, not a whole lot of quarterly variance on the - where the orders are emanating from. Pricing, we have, as we noted, adjusted our prices for the 450, 550 commensurate with where they are in their life cycle. We have not, and do not, intend to adjust for 650 prices. Robert Stallard : And any change on the G280 there? Phebe Novakovic : No, it's about the same. Robert Stallard : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter J. Arment with Stern Agee CRT. Peter Arment : This quarter. Phebe, could you give us an update on kind of where things are on the G500 and G600 program? I saw the announcement earlier this month on kind of the progress but, you know, kind of how you view those programs transitioning into 2017 and 2018? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. Both airplanes, the G500 and the G600 are moving nicely through their test program. There have been no negative surprises. And as I think you alluded to, you read that we recently joined the wing to the fuselage and on the G600 we expect to fly later this year or early 2017. From the sales perspective, the customer interest in both airplanes has been good and, you know, and as we progress through the development program, we expect the demand to increase. Bye the way, to - for those of you who like to speculate about Gulfstream future models. I wanted to assure you that there is no 600ER. We'll be able to publish a definitive range for that plane once we're in test flight, and we have a reputation for exceeding our target, but the G600 is the G600. Erin Linnihan : I think we can take the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Co. Cai Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. Good numbers, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you. Cai Rumohr : Could you comment on two things, you know, why was your profitability quite so good this quarter, and particularly where was R&D? And secondly, you mentioned a couple of deliveries slipping from this year into next year. How many slipped? And why did they slip? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So, you know, profitability and you're focus on cost is a quarter-by-quarter battle. At Gulfstream, we had a couple of things. Favorable mix, improved labor efficiency, very nice high margins at service at Gulfstream, both from the mix of service in the barn and performance. We also had substantial improvement in G&A expense, even though R&D went up slightly. You know, we're benefiting from all of the cost cutting we've been doing. We've been improving our processes, reducing waste and we're also getting some benefit from lower material costs. So the cost initiatives began in 2015 to reduce overhead and indirect throughout the enterprise are paying off. Cai Rumohr : And the slips in deliveries? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, so the slips in delivery. We, every year, every quarter, working with our customers, can determine whether it's more convenient or preferable to take one, two, three airplanes in a given quarter, in a given year. It's not unusual for us to move airplanes across reporting periods or across years even. So we typically haven't talked about it before, but I wanted to give you guys a little bit more understanding of a revenue number. Cai Rumohr : Thank you Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Samuel Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Sam. Samuel Pearlstein : Just to ask something other than Gulfstream. Can you talk a little bit about the Ohio replacement? And I guess what I'm trying to just think about is when does that start to grow for you in terms of revenues? When do you start booking and so we see it in backlog? And really doesn't that have a negative margin mix as you transition work from Virginia class to Ohio replacement, and how should we think about that transition? Phebe Novakovic : So let me talk to you with that. We have, over the last three years, been increasing our revenue and our performance on Ohio, all in the engineering and design portfolio side of our business. Those margins are all in the cost plus work tend to be less than mature in production construction on submarines, right? So you've seen that that quarter-over-quarter for the last several years, and that along with the two per year for Virginia has driven some of the growth. That will - from my perspective, the engineering and design work will be stable going forward, until it begins to transition down in the latter part of this decade. The - while we don't have specific time lines for when we're going to build the first ship, I think it's in the 2020, 2021 timeframe, but we're going to see some early, likely to see a taskless prologue. Some early material purchases so that we can, you know, we can lock in some favorable rates. So that program will program will really begin to ramp up really in the 2020's and go on for some time. The margin profile way out then is going to be driven in the first instance by how the contract is structured, and I don't know. We don't know yet, and I think the Navy, we're still working with the Navy on how they want to do that. Typically, in complex naval ship building programs, the first ship is cost plus, but that's the Navy's decision and we'll have a lot more clarity about the margin performance. But, again, it's past is prologue, Electric Boat has shown the proclivity and the ability to increase their profitability by reducing their cost and improving their manufacturing efficiency hull over hull. So this is a very important program for General Dynamics. Increasingly now, but very much in the future. Samuel Pearlstein : And if I just looked at that past, do you typically do the long lead? Is it two years ahead of the boat construction starting? When do you start that long...? Phebe Novakovic : I think it's about two years before. Samuel Pearlstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Doug Harned : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : Hi. I wanted to continue in Marine. The other big thing that is coming up is the competition for the TAO205, the LXR and the LHA8. And when you look at that, one would naturally see NASSCO as the choice for the TA205, Ingles is the logical choice for the other two ships. But how do you see NASSCO's position in competing for, particularly the LXR? Can you use the MLP hull form and be an effective competitor in that part of this competition? Phebe Novakovic : Well, we've already submitted our bids and, you know, I'll get myself in a really sticky wicket if I spoke to the Navy about relative competency. But we know how to build the TAOX, no surprise, and we've bid appropriately on that entire solicitation. So I think that's about all that I'm permitted to say. Sorry about that. Doug Harned : Okay. Phebe Novakovic : Ask the Navy. See what they say. Doug Harned : No, I understand. Phebe Novakovic : I ask the Navy, so. Doug Harned : Okay. And what do you see as sort of the timeframe now on how that's going to play out, that decision? Phebe Novakovic : I'm told that it will be sometime this year. Doug Harned : For the... Phebe Novakovic : But I don't have any more clarity whether it's third or fourth quarter. Doug Harned : Okay. Okay. That's great. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. David Strauss : A couple of questions on Gulfstream. I think your large cabin delivery guidance for 2016 was 104? Can you tell us what it is now, with some of the push out? Is the plan still to hold Gulfstream EBIT flat beyond 2016? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : I'm not going to give you the 2017 guidance. What I told you is, we're going to do 2016 at flat EBIT and that looks very, very possible from our perspective. I think we're moving one large cabin airplane from this year to next and a couple of mid cabins. David Strauss : And Phebe, can you explain the large gap between green large-cabin deliveries in the quarter and completed? I don't think I've ever seen that large of a gap. Phebe Novakovic : Oh, it's all timing, and it is the druthers of the customers on what they want in terms of outfitting them on their airplanes and any special configurations. There's nothing there that's particularly anomalous, simply timing. David Strauss : All right. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Robert Spingarn : Hi. So maybe we'll switch to IS&T for a minute; I wanted to ask you about two things there. Just on this big IDIQ on jitters for the handheld, three of you participating there, competing, so I wanted to ask you how you think about that in terms of orders for the contract, how that might impact IS&T sales and margins going forward? And then separately, this stretch of WIN-T and how that might affect things? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So as it was reported in the press, we were down selected along with two others for what is essentially a 12.7 billion, five-year hunting license, and it- the way we're thinking about it in the moment is we deliver the next generation radio hardware in this quarter for evaluation and then full wave production follows that, conceivable this quarter and next. One thing that I think is interesting to note, is we've got the only radio that's a proven MUOS capable terminal. So that ought to, from another perspective, be a by the competitive advantage. You know, it's, with these IDIQ programs, you've got to sort of handicap what you see as your win rate. We typically have been very successful in our win rates, but again, it will be highly competitive and we're just going to have to work our way through it. This is a mission systems, where this resides is a high-operating leverage business, so I would expect them to perform nicely on those IDIQ contracts that they win. WIN-T is, you know, WIN-T has slipped more than a skater on the ice. We're in increment two; it's in full rate production. It's going to be fielded to the next, I think, to an active brigade combat team and National Guard units over the next eight, nine years. And it is already in the field and successfully supporting down range missions. So from a financial perspective, it's performing very nicely. It's sort of up to our customer on what the pace of deployments will be, but heretofore we've managed, because of our intimacy with the customer, we've managed to accommodate their desires nicely, and I would expect that to continue. Robert Spingarn : So, Phebe, net-net, it sounds like the jitters is a positive relative to what you're thinking might have been when you initially provided 2016 guidance, and therefore, is it fair to assume that you'll bake that in with when we hear from you next on this? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah. If, in fact, they start to issue the IDIQ purchase orders within this year. So that's part of what I don't know, right? Robert Spingarn : Right. So it could be a 2017 thing? Phebe Novakovic : It could be. But I don't know. So... Robert Spingarn : Okay. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to the booking strength in IS&T and maybe even the margin strange in IS&T, sort of the difference between IT and Mission, give us some color on that, and maybe where some of that strength is coming from? Phebe Novakovic : So let's talk about this in two parts. Our Mission system is still benefiting from the cost synergies we achieved by combining two of our businesses. They're also - and by the way, that's why I was interested in that combination. But the business unit guys were saying and oh, by the way, in addition to cost savings, we're going to see some marketing synergies. And I said, yeah, good, great. Well, it turns out they were right. So they have won more than their fair share, and that's reflected in no small measure in that $1.3 book-to-bill. And their performance, operating performance is really terrific. Now, this margin rate in the moment is a bit high going-forward. And while I'm not ready to update guidance, this group should be a double-digit earner in the near future. We've got additional opportunities for margin improvement in efficiencies and performance, and it - the margin performance in this group on the Mission Systems side is heavily driven by the product mix. On the IT side, again, this is a very competitive business, with terrific cash flow, and as I always like to tell everybody, great return on invested capital. They are very disciplined when they go into the market, and they win their fair share. And I say disciplined, we're careful that he we don't, you know, pursue contracts down rat holes where we don't think we can get a decent return. Carter Copeland : And in terms of their pipeline, do you expect to continue to see win rates like this? And you know, obviously the market is, as you stated, pretty competitive, but clearly you've seen this trend for a while now. Phebe Novakovic : So, you know, it is very difficult to project win rates in such a short cycle business. I've been pleased with how they've done. They can - they've got more performance opportunity, cost cutting opportunity, as they would quarter in, quarter out, and so, you know, a combination of performance and cost efficiency, dedication to schedule adherence to schedule, schedule is not a guideline, right? Those are the things that make you win, and these businesses are firing on all cylinders, so I'm pretty place pleased. Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks for the color, Phebe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jeffries. Phebe Novakovic : Hey, Howard. Howard Rubel : Good morning, Phebe. Thank you. To go to Combat Systems for a moment, I mean, you know, it's always lumpy when we see ads to the backlog, but keeping it stable at this point seems pretty good, given the large contracts you're working on. Could you address what you're seeing in terms of incremental interest internationally? Phebe Novakovic : So as you and I have talked about on this call before, the world remains a dangerous place, and that Russian fair is roaring. So we've got considerable interests in interest in places that you might think. Just to give you a little bit of color on some of the contracts that we have just put into backlog, the Swiss Army is purchasing 4.4 combat vehicles, and that went in I think this quarter for about $400 million, U.S. dollars. So that was good. The Czech Republic is on the map, as is the Spanish 8 by 8 technology program, and our land systems is in good position on that - on that program. And then we continue to see demand signals coming out of the Mid East. Iraqi tanks, Kuwait and in other parts of the Mid East where there's some really hot wars going on. So you know the pipeline looks good internationally. And if you look at the Army budget, they're beginning to recapitalize, so that's pretty wholesome in and of itself. So, again, as in the IS&T case, our ability to perform with contract, keep our costs down will be the key to, again, winning more of our fair share. And oh, by the way, our armaments business is doing quite nicely as well. Howard Rubel : That doesn't surprise me. Just sort of a little bit related to profitability, just to go to Marine for a second, the numbers were really good, could you address in some way how you were doing on Zumwalt and some of the other programs, just in terms of capability. Because, I mean, they seem to be surprising a little bit on the bottom line? Phebe Novakovic : So let me give you some clarity on this program. Operationally, the ship is performing quite nicely; it's been out on two sea trials and we like what we see and, more importantly, our customer seems to. But let me remind everybody of a couple of things. First, we are not the integrator of prime on this ship, the Navy is. So I really don't have any insight into the program beyond our shipyard. I think that's the first thing to consider. The second thing is our share of the $22.4 billion program is less than about a quarter. So, again, that gives you some perspective. The Navy reported some cost growth to the Congress over the last 12 months and I don't have visibility into that number. I do know, what I do know, is that that VAS has experienced some cost growth primarily on the first of cost ship, which is the cost plus help. But that's not a surprise given the complexity of this ship. And we continue to work close closely with the Navy to ensure that, you know, we're delivering the ships that they want and that they need operationally and that, you know, we minimize or reduce risk, manage the risk from the second two ships. The 51 programs are running in tandem with 1000 and we've seen some impacts, as we started up a co-line, the 51s. And by the way, this flight of 51s is materially different and upgraded than the former flight. So we're confident that we can work through these, and we know these ships. So, again, we're working with the Navy on scheduling costs so that we can ensure we get them what they need with profitability that we require. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much, Phebe. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning Phebe Novakovic : Good Morning. Seth Seifman : I'll ask the capital deployment question this morning and basically, obviously there's not really anything to quarrel with in a billion dollars of share repurchased in the quarter, but it's not the first time that you've bought back a billion dollars, and you know, given sort of the underlying objective of the repurchase program to be opportunistic, obviously you've had some opportunities in the first quarter, how do we think about share repurchases going forward and, you know, would you characterize what you did in the quarter as opportunistic? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah. I mean, we believe that the stock was undervalued, so we went in and bought and we'll continue to do that in instances where we think the market has mispriced our stock. That's our view, and we've been consistent about that strategy. So I think that's not a particularly big change. Seth Seifman : Right. And any color about the level of repurchases going forward? Phebe Novakovic : Well, because we're opportunistic, you know, I'm going to have to see, you know, we understand in the absence of M&A, it's, and given the investments that is we're making in our gross businesses, I think it's a reasonable, shareholder friendly action to take, and, frankly, you know, never forget, it's all about the shareholders. Seth Seifman : Yep. Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Myles Walton : Can I ask a question on cash flow? And I know last year 1Q is a tougher comp and most of the advanced burn was in the second half of last year, but the improvement in conversion from herein out through the rest of the year, should we expect that to kind of pick up the pace and do you think conversion will actually be better than last year before you get to full conversion in 2017? You know, I think the way we think about that, and I think we signaled this before is that, you know, we the expect the free cash flow profile this year to look similar to last year. As you mentioned, it was a particularly tough comp from the first quarter of last year, which far outstripped our expectations and outstripped really a typical Q1 profile. The first quarter is usually a slightly softer cash performance and frankly, sometimes in the past it has even been negative. So on balance, I think you look at the year as similar to last year. It will fluctuate a little bit on the timing of some of the remaining progress payments and outflows on the international programs. Myles Walton : Okay. And then, Phebe thinks for the color on the 650. But I'm curious, is there a level where you think the pre-owned stock becomes more of an obstacle to you selling aircraft or pricing, or maintaining the price? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let me be clear. We're not going to drop the 650 price, or the 450, 550, based on the use. We don't compete that way. But let's talk about that used market. And it's not a homogeneous market. It's highly differentiated by model types. So let's think about it in two respects. You've got the 450, 550 used market that is mature, it's established, it has demonstrated factors that influence its behavior, and we have watched it now for well over a decade. The 650 is an immature developing market. So let me parse, if it would help a little bit, let me walk through both of those markets. So with respect to the 450, 550, we did lose some G550's to the used inventory because there were a lot of them, the late models, that were available, and there still are to some degree. But this is an active market, it's a very active market, and so it has pretty good throughput. I think in the last 12 months we sold - the market sold 29 used G550's. So this is a market with predictable and understandable transition rates and activity rates. And conversions. I hear less about the 450's used market, but I think the 450 is attractively priced. The bigger problem for those models, frankly, is that some customers are waiting for the G500 and G600. Now, the same has not been true to this point for the G650. I'm not aware of losing a single G650 new airplane ordered to a used airplane. I would also comment that, as I noted before, this pre-owned market is developing, it's a developing market. For example, it's not clear how many dedicated sellers we have. Some folks have been there in there for three years and not lowered the price. And there's not been a transaction there for some time. The early 650's, the early models, N numbers that were available to sellers or are available, are attractive at favorable prices, above the original sale price. Those were earlier on, but, you know, we've got to see how that market develops. By the way, we're very happy to help buyers in the used markets get into our airplanes. But one of these days, the market will be determined. But so far, it's just too speculative to observe outcomes. Myles Walton : Okay. So you're comfortable with continuing to grow and pricing won't enter the discussion, but you're sold out for the next 24 months. So that's kind of the landscape as we see it right now? Phebe Novakovic : Very wholesome. Myles Walton : Okay. Thanks. Erin Linnihan : And Liz, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research. Hunter Keay : Hi. Thanks for getting me on. I appreciate it. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Hunter Keay : Good morning. So Phebe, you talked about the difference in time between green deliveries and completions, and as it relates to customer preference. I'm wondering if that sort of implies maybe you shift away from fleet sales and more to sort of individual purposes. And maybe I'm just reading too much into it? And can you confirm that one way or the other? And can you also talk about, generally, how you think about margins versus fleet sales to the individual one off purchases? Thanks very much. Phebe Novakovic : Okay. So I wouldn't read too much into the timing difference between green deliveries and completed. I mean, there's really nothing there. With respect to fleet and - and individual, let's talk about fleet. You know, fleet can be a fair number of aircraft going into a Corporation to replenish their, and refresh their active fleet. There's another series of fleet buyers that are fractional. We have very little exposure to fractional markets. And then there's another set of fleet buyers that buy for the Airlines. So that's a little bit different as well. And, again, we don't have too many of those. We are very careful on our pricing, very careful. So don't think about those as materially different. Obviously you get some volume discounts. But we have a pretty strict pricing discipline. Okay? Hunter Keay : Got it. Thanks a lot for the time. Phebe Novakovic : Great. Erin Linnihan : Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3583. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff VP for Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Candice, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter Conference Call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you Erin, and good morning. As you may observe from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $7.67 billion, and net earnings of $758 million. We reported EPS of $2.44 per diluted share, $0.17 a share better than the year-ago quarter. We were also $0.13 a share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the self-side anticipated about $200 million more revenue, lower margins, and a somewhat higher tax rate. Compared to consensus, we had about $30 million more in operating earnings on higher margins, $10 million less in taxes, resulting in about $40 million more in net earnings. The big driver in the quarter was the operational performance. Compared to the year-ago quarter, revenue of $7.67 billion was $217 million lower. However, earnings of $758 million were up $6 million on a 30-basis point improvement in operating margin, and 140-basis point lower effective tax rate. I should note that our earnings in the year-ago quarter included a gain on the sale of our Commercial Cyber business. Excluding that gain, there is a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, revenue was down $59 million, or less than 1%, and earnings from continuing operations were up $28 million on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margins, and a lower effective tax rate. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2016 and compare it to the first half of 2015. Revenue was down 1.8% against the first half of 2015. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $15 million. Operating margins were 30 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $20 million. EPS was $0.36 better. In short, we are off to a good start, ahead of both our internal plan and external expectation. That leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance shortly. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year, and wrap that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace; Aerospace had a very good quarter. Revenue of $2.13 billion was $124 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $434 million were only $5 million less on a 90-basis point improvement in operating margins. Importantly, on a sequential basis, revenue was up $147 million or 7.4%, and operating earnings were up $23 million or 5.6%. For the first half, revenue at $4.12 billion is off $245 million against last year, reflecting planned production cuts to the G450 and the G550, offset in part by increased delivery of the G650. However, earnings at $845 million are off only $25 million on a 60-basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $845 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, we are well-positioned to achieve or exceed our earning goal for the year. By the way, recall that last year we told you that we had in Q1 a positive supplier settlement. Absent that contribution, earnings would actually have been up this year. So let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter, and then some observations about the current state of the market. First, on a numerical or unit basis, we had 50% more orders than we did in the first quarter. However, the mix was not as advantageous. In other words, think about it this way, we sold more mid-cabin in the quarter than in the first quarter. So the dollar-based book-to-bill was not much better. About a third of our orders in the quarter were mid-cabin. Activity and interest level were good throughout the quarter. But at the end of the quarter when many transactions typically closed, activity almost ceased as a result of the events associated with the Brexit vote. However, those customers did not go away, and are continuing to pursue transactions with us this quarter. We are quite optimistic regarding third quarter sales activity. Active prospects are very good, better than at any time in the year. The U.S. jobs report earlier this month, slightly improved economics stories in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Europe, coupled with the quick market recovery from the initial Brexit vote reaction, seemed to have accelerated the activity level on our prospects. We fully expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. You may recall that the G500 made its first flight in the second quarter last year. This month, it made its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow. T4, that's the fourth test article, made the flight from Savannah to Farnborough in 6 hours and 55 minutes, traveling at a steady 0.9 Mach. Flight test is going very well, and we are on or somewhat ahead of schedule. We look forward to the first flight of the G600 late this year. Let's take a look at Combat. They had a very solid quarter. Revenue was $1.32 billion, $93 million less than the second quarter last year. However, a 60-basis point improvement in operating margins resulted in a modest $7 million increase in operating earnings over the year-ago quarter. All-in-all, very good operating leverage and an outstanding 16.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $42 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings were up $2 million, about 1%. For the first half, revenue was down $183 million, or 6.6%, against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings, on the other hand, were up $6 million on a 130-basis point margin expansion. Pretty impressive operating performance. Work is progressing quite well on our international orders, with prototypes in production for both our AJAX program and our Canadian Mid-East (8:08) contract. We were also awarded a contract to begin fast ceiling (8:13) of the up-gun Stryker. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $1.99 billion was $14 million lower than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were off $6 million against the year-ago quarter, and operating margins were off 20 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $144 million due to timing on submarine material purchases. Operating earnings were down $11 million, resulting in a modest 10-basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.1 billion was up $174 million, or 4.4% against the first half of 2015. Operating earnings were essentially the same on somewhat lower margins. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us, and will continue to be so. We have some work to do on margins in the second half. Turning to IS&T, that group continues to do well. Revenue of $2.2 billion and operating earnings of $244 million were up against the year-ago quarter $14 million and $7 million, respectively. There was a 20-basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive when one considers that the sale of the Commercial Cyber products business contributed 100 basis points of margin in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $104 million, but operating earnings were down only $4 million, or 1.6%, on a 30-basis point improvement in margin. This 10.9% margin is the strongest in nearly five years. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $23 million, 0.5%, and operating earnings were up $38 million, or 8.4%, on a 90-basis point improvement in margin. So once again, very strong operating leverage. This group also tells a story about building the backlog through the first half. Book-to-bill at about 1.3, which marks the eighth quarter in the last 10 quarters the group has achieved a book-to-bill equal to or greater than 1 :1. In short, we believe all this leaves us poised for a good second half. So turning to guidance. Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, and then compare it to what we told you in January, and then wrap it up into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue somewhat lower than 2015 and margins somewhat higher than 2015, leading to flat operating earnings. We now expect to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion of revenue, with margins slightly above 20%. This implies a slight pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the third quarter. This will result in operating earnings the same as last year or even slightly better. Despite all the handwringing by some, these two businesses will continue to perform well. So for Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of approximately $5.8 billion, and margins in the mid-15% area. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.7 billion, and margins at 16% to 16.1%. Revenue will see strong uplift in the fourth quarter. The difference in revenue guidance is simply from timing. For the Marine group, we previously guided to revenue of $8 billion and margins in the mid-9% range. We now expect revenue to be between $8.1 billion and $8.2 billion, and margins around 9.2%. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of about $9 billion and margins approaching double-digits. It now appears that our revenue guidance was good, with slight upward pressure, and that operating margins would be somewhat better than 10.5% for the year. So all of this rolls up into revenue for GD of about $31.5 billion, operating margins of 13.7% to 13.8%, net income somewhat more than the $3 billion, and a return on sales of around 9.6%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, but higher operating income on higher margins, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70. To help you further, our original EPS guidance was $9.20 per share. The $0.50 difference is $0.24 from operations, $0.09 from a lower tax rate, and $0.17 from share repurchases. If you think about the progression for the remainder of the year, third quarter should be somewhat weaker than the second quarter, but much like the first quarter, followed by a very strong fourth quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with an update to an issue that we've been addressing since last year, and that's the impact we're seeing from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. This continues to be focused in our Combat Systems group, and when you compare that group's results to the first half of 2016 to the similar period a year ago, our 2016 revenue would have been higher by approximately $75 million, had the exchange rates that prevailed in the first half of 2015 remained in effect this year. And for the company as a whole, revenue would have been a little over $100 million higher. Moving down the income statement, our net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2015. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $45 million, versus $41 million for the same period in 2015. For 2016, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $95 million, up from 2015 due to lower cash balances resulting from our capital deployment activities, which I'll cover in just a minute. We continue to expect free cash flow this year to look similar to 2015, though more weighted to the latter part of the year. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $1.9 billion, and a net debt position of $1.5 billion, both essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we had $500 million of fixed rate notes mature, and we're in the process of refinancing that debt as we speak. We intend to replace that debt and raise an additional $500 million from general corporate purposes to include share repurchases. Our effective tax rate was 27.7% for the quarter. This was lower than our original expectation as we adopted a new accounting standard that altered the accounting for tax benefits associated with our stock options and restricted stock. In a nutshell, these tax benefits are now treated as a permanent benefit that impact our effective tax rate. In the second quarter, this change reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 140 basis points. We're at a rate of 28.8% year-to-date, and we're now targeting a full-year rate right around 29%. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares, bringing us to just under 9 million shares in the first half of 2016 for almost $1.2 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first six months of the year, we spent $1.6 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than two times our free cash flow for the first half. Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Candice, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Absolutely. And our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, David. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, Phebe. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, thanks for all the color on Gulfstream, but maybe just a little bit more color on the large cabin market, and how you saw it evolve in Q2, both from a used inventory perspective, how you're competing on the G450 and G550 with the used inventory that's out there, and the G650, and then what you saw regionally? Did North America hold in there pretty well? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So I think I gave you a pretty robust response in my remarks, but let me parse this, our market, in a couple of ways. First, let's talk about the G650 pre-owned market. So I've seen some folks saying there are going to be 20, or there are 21 used airplanes in the market. We simply do not see them. If I count serial numbers, we have 14 on the market right now with one pending transaction. We have 186 in service, so that equates to 7.5% of the fleet. That is well below the 10% used to in-service ratio. So that's rather typical. And by the way, we have long anticipated the emergence of a G650 used market, so in my mind, this should be no surprise. I would also note that we have seen minimal impact with a few customers choosing the near-term availability rather than wait. So from my perspective, based on the facts and the data, we're quite comfortable that that used market is appropriate and acting in a rational and typical sort of way. So G650, so if you talk about by model, the G650 demand remains quite active. In our subs market, sub-sections of the market, the G450 and G550 are, as we anticipated during this period of transition to the G500 and G600, complicated the touch by competitors' overproduction. By the way, I might tell you that the G500 and G600, a lot of those positions are sold in 2016 and 2017. So we like how all of that is shaping up. And with respect to the geographic distribution, about 50% of the orders were North America, and I think the rest split between Mid-East, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America, in that order. Okay? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. I wanted to switch to Marine for a moment, Phebe. You guided for us earlier, but you have a lot going on there. You've got the Block IV pricing going up, there's growth in ORP (20:33) funding. When would we start to see some real improvement in sales from all of these positives? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've been experiencing that improvement, but when we look at the Navy's plan to continue with the Gulfstream, or the Virginia-class deliveries, as well as other (21:00) replacement, we see that we get some real nice ignition starting in 2019, when we have long-lead delivery \u2013 how we're anticipating, based on the Navy's plan, long-lead delivery in 2019. But let's not forget, this has been a very nice, steady quarter-over-quarter performer. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): True. And how would the TAO(X) factor in, and does that impact NASSCO's margins later this year, next year, the win there? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the TAO(X), let's remember that our award was for one ship, and multiple, I think with five options, subject to the request, authorization and appropriation. So those oilers are right in our wheelhouse, and we ought to be able to perform very nicely on those. And it positions us well for the 17 ships in the Navy contract. It was an unusual award, but it has \u2013 there were no surprises, and I think, from (22:06) was an unusual contracting process, but from my point of view, there were no surprises, because sort of lined up with, who does what well. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Phebe, you talked a lot about the earnings and the revenue for the year. In the past, you've talked about free cash flow conversion relative to last year. So now with a higher net income, should we still see a similar conversion? And somewhat related, we knew you were going to be eating into those international combat advances, but really, what should that advances line look like when we get to the end of the year on the balance sheet? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sam, so as I addressed in my remarks, we do continue to see full year free cash flow for this year looking similar to what we had last year, although as I said, a little bit inverted toward the second half of the year, slightly different profile than we had last year from a timing standpoint. As it relates to the advances, we'll continue to draw down on those, so you'll see that balance \u2013 you've seen it come down throughout the first half of the year, and we'll see that continue, as we continue to make progress on the production side of those contracts through the balance of the year. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : But coming down at the same rate? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I don't have the exact specifics on that. We can perhaps talk after the call on that. But directionally, yeah, we'll see it continue to come down. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Doug. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to try and understand a little bit of the margin situation at Gulfstream. I mean, the margins have been great, at around 20% level, even with declining production. So, can you talk a little bit about what's enabled you to achieve that as you're going through a transition to the new programs? You have a lower rate on the G450 and G550. And when you roll that forward, do you expect, if you have to take rate down perhaps even more on the G450 and G550, can you keep that margin level through the product transition? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let's talk about this year, and I don't want to get into too much specificity in 2017 and 2018. But the margins are driven by \u2013 and this is true year in and year out \u2013 they're driven by our managing of costs and our cost reduction, in addition to the G650's nice contribution. So when I think about that, that and our performance on service has been quite nice through the course of the year. So I have a great deal of confidence that we can continue to maintain our profitability as we go through. We'll have to modify it somewhat, but with our profitability, going through this transition period. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And that is \u2013 but even as you take rates down and you, in theory, would lose some operating leverage. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've pretty much planned in the rates on the G450. I don't see any more reductions. In fact, I don't see any more reduction on the G450. And the G550, we see very minimal changes going forward. So looks, our job is to keep earnings up as high as possible during this transition period, and manage our margins. We're going to continue to do that. I think we've demonstrated that track record the last six quarters, and we're going to continue going forward. Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. First, Phebe, I have a clarification. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thank you. Sorry. I think you said G500, G600 sold in 2016 and 2017. Did you mean that you're largely sold out in 2017 and 2018? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm sorry, if I wasn't clear on that. The G650 is sold out in its entirety through the first quarter or through 2016, and also in its entirety through 2017. So when we look at the order activity on the G500 and G600, what I'm saying is, is that our expectations for entry into service would remain the same. In that projection, we have sold an awful lot of our both of those G500s and G600s. So that positions us very well, I think. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : So I'm sorry, again, so 2017 and 2018 for the G500 and G600 are largely sold. Is that how I'm hearing this? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We've got a lot of sales Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : And then just to follow this, it sounds like, though, there were some adjustments to the large cabin delivery schedule. Could you articulate where you are for this year? And I guess, you probably won't. And then maybe if you can address some elements of how you're thinking about 2017. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So I don't want to get into 2017 at the moment because, as you know, we provide that to you in the fourth quarter of the 2016 call by tradition. So that said, let me give you some color on where we are in the moment. First, production rates this year have not changed. So we've kept them the same as when we set this plan. Revenue is impacted in 2016 by a couple of factors; one, we have one less screen (28:12) airplane, I think it's the G280, and six fewer completions. We're moving these completions from this year into next, largely because of customer preferences on when they want to take the plane. And then we got a mix of other smaller puts and takes. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open. Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, Phebe. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the G500 and the G600 really quickly. I think, at the launch event a few years ago you suggested that the book-to-bill, or the bookings that you take on that aircraft would be kind of barbelled. You take some at the beginning, would have a lull until you got closer to the entry into service of the aircraft. I'm wondering, if that's still the way that you're thinking about that. And at what point historically do you see the second into that barbell begin to pick up? Meaning when (29:16) we see some more orders for the G500 and G600 begin to come in relative to the entry into service? How much before entry into service do we see that to pick back up? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So I don't have perfect clarity about the precise timing of when orders will pick up, but it's our expectation building on the good sales we've had (29:39) that the closer these airplanes are to entry into service, our sales will pick up. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Myles. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Phebe, can you comment on the capital deployment strategy and where your head is currently in terms of M&A? The market's gotten richer or cheaper in property, availability has gotten better or worse, and also the repurchase slowdown, is there anything to read there? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So on M&A, I really don't have any update for you, but if and when we do something, we'll let you know. We'll advise you. Jason, do you want to talk through the share repurchase? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think, Myles, for the balance, when you think about the year, our objectives, our targets for the year on deployment haven't changed. As you know, we were fairly on the active side in the first quarter of the year. And so we looked at the second quarter, and we feel like by the balance of the first half of the year we're right on track and doing exactly what we had hoped to do. We've deployed, as I said, two times our free cash flow on share repurchase and dividends. So I don't think you should see that as a signal of any directional shift for us at any time. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So the full year return on capital still targeted to be 100% of net income then? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's correct. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, and nice quarter. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a clarification and a question. I know, Phebe, you said the production plan didn't change, but I just wondered if you could clarify whether or not your cost plan changed at all. I know you had some cost reduction actions and furloughs. I didn't know if any of that changed from what you initially planned on. And then one for Jason, just on the FX front, I mean, you've called out the UK impact. I think, you've got a little bit of Swiss impact as well. What should we be thinking of in terms of forward impacts, if currencies stay where they are? Are there any transactional FX exposures that we should be aware of going forward? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So look, as I mentioned earlier, our margins at that level really aren't sustainable each and every quarter. But the G650 is contributing, and really it's cost management, cost reduction that's driving our margins. And so it's hard with perfect clarity to estimate the goodness that you can achieve until you're really in the moment. So we're continuing to manage our costs. I think we've got more way to go. And then at the same time, by the way, we've got to continue to improve the G650 and G280 operating margins, which we will do and are doing. And then we've got to ensure that the G400 and G500, or G450 and G500 maintain their profitability. And so I think that (33:05) very nice on track, particularly with respect to the latter. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So Carter, with respect to your foreign exchange question, you can think about our exposure as this way, in order of magnitude, if you will. It's really Canadian dollars, euros, pounds, and then Swiss francs sort of, in terms of magnitude. But the updated guidance that Phebe walked you through earlier was actually predicated on the latest rates we have at hand projected through the balance of the year. So that is the latest look at the impact, and it's not \u2013 I wouldn't call it material through the balance of the year, but we also don't necessarily take a bet on rates moving further one way or another. So if there is a further movement in the second half, we would obviously tell you about that and it could have an upside or a downside impact to that guidance. The last thing I would say is that there's no, absolutely zero, from our perspective, transactional exposure. This is all strictly, as we've discussed before, the translation for U.S. dollar reporting. Everything from a transactional perspective is hedged in, and has been working effectively up to this point. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ron. Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Phebe, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update where we stand on the Ohio-class program, in terms of what's going on actually at Electric Boat, and then what you're looking for over the next coming quarters. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So if you've been following this, the Navy and Electric Boat have been active in a number of discussions. Most recently we delivered our Ohio Replacement Integrated Product and Process Development plan, and think about that as the detailed design and long lead material portion of the procurement process. So the Navy is reviewing that in the moment. I think their plan is to get back to us sometime late summer, early fall. But that's kind of their call in terms of the cadence of the timing. But that will provide, and should provide, depending when we close on that, some upside in this year. And then again, as we've talked before, this is a very strong growth engine for us over time. Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, how far are the G450 and G550 sold into next year? And I think, at one point you said you'd rather take down production than take down price. How large is that period between when that backlog ends and when we might see initial deliveries of the G500? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, I'm comfortable that we can manage this transition, and we are in good shape to either \u2013 we sold a fair number of the positions going into next year, particularly on the G450, and also on the G550. So the transition, the trick to the transition is, we've got to bring down the production on the G450, G550 while ramping up the production on the G500 and G600. The ease of this is somewhat benefited, or somewhat benefits, from the fact that these two sets of airplanes are built in completely different facilities. So, if you're suggesting that we have a gap, that's not an altogether bad thing, as long as we stay on schedule for our deliveries on the G500 and G600, which I see no reason why we can't at the moment, but we're in good shape for next year on the G450, G550. Got a little ways more to go, and then we'll set the production rate for the G500 and G600 as we move forward. So does that get to the essence of your question? Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us, maybe Jason, of the shortfall in cash flow, free cash flow, relative to net income this year, maybe in kind of qualitative terms, how much of that is related to the construction of flight test articles for G500 and G600? And do all those flight test articles go to customers, and so do all of those costs go into inventory? Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So the flight test articles do go into inventory, and eventually they'll go into long-term product design use or to customers. I would say, from a qualitative standpoint, the outsized impact on the cash flow differential is really more about the international program advances being drawn down. There's some impact on, not so much the flight test aircraft impacting Gulfstream so much as just inventory build toward production, but that's the minor share. The larger share really is about the international advance drawdown. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi George. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Yes. Hi, Phebe. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : I wanted to pursue, you had four used sales in Gulfstream. Could you give us the revenues and approximate earnings? And I would assume that that would have deflated the margin you reported, as high as it was. So when you go to the second half and you have higher revenues, why does the margin be somewhat less than what it was this quarter? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So George, I'll take that. The revenues for the quarter were right around $40 million, I believe, is the number for pre-owned, and as is typical, it's right around breakeven, maybe a $1 million or $2 million loss associated with those, which is pretty typical. If I understand your question, for the balance of the year we do have profiled, as we've talked about before, an expectation of additional pre-owned coming into inventory and being sold, which actually is consistent with the point Phebe made before, with a little bit of a downtick in margins, particularly in the third quarter. So I think those are consistent, unless I misunderstood your question about the balance of the year. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : No. I think it's right, Jason. I just thought that, to deliver four used planes in subsequent quarters, you're probably not going to do that much, maybe you will. So I was kind of figuring the used planes would be less, so you got a little less pressure on the profit and you got higher revenues. Jason W. Aiken - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Actually, a little bit more color on that, the planes in the quarter, there were four of them, but the mix of them, they were pretty modest in terms of revenue per unit. So that's not the assumption necessarily going forward. There are a lot of different mix in there, in terms of the inventory that we take in. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah (40:48). So think about it this way, George. We sold four in the quarter, which you know. We took in three and have sold one, so today we have two in inventory. But remember that the margin impact can vary depending on the aircraft itself. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. No, that's a good answer. And one quick one, Combat margin is usually the biggest in the fourth quarter, and yet your guidance is implying that second half won't be as good as the first half. So if you had a little explanation on that. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So we are in the third quarter and more importantly, in the fourth quarter beginning to move from our \u2013 as the domestic land forces contract, some of those begin to taper down, we are increasing our international production. So we've got \u2013 that's really the margin pressure. It's simply a question of mix. As long as operating performance is good, these guys have done very well, but they've got to come down their learning curves, right? George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Very good. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Phebe, can you give us any color on the customer mix or geography on all those mid cabins in the quarter that you sold? And was that order activity in line with your expectation on a dollar-based book-to-bill basis, or would you say you're slightly surprised with the upside? And sort of to that, can you talk about how wait times on the mids change in the quarter? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So if I understand your question properly, our sales on the G280 were a little different, or a little better than we had anticipated. And I think that's just reflecting the strength of the North American market. So with respect to wait times, and let me give you this opportunity or take this opportunity to give you a little bit of color on the wait times, on the G650 and G650ER, we're about 24 months; G550 and G450, nine months to 12 months, no change; G280, nine months to 12 months; and the G150, we've got onesies and twosies left to sell there. So the first available there is a year from now. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. So on the G280, better than expected, that wasn't just timing, that was actually just \u2013 maybe you just won a few more awards that could have gone either way. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that, that's right. And it wasn't \u2013 that's always the case. We understand our customers' needs, but the order in which they want to execute the placement of their fleet will kind of depend on their imminent needs for the mission that a particular airplane serves. So the good news is, they're selling well, the G280s, but it does impact book-to-bill. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. Thank you. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Candice, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah, Phebe, I guess, I'll ask you one on the Navy subs program. I'm wondering how you think about \u2013 there seems to be some emerging chatter from the Democrats about the affordability of nuclear triad recapitalization. And I know you have some potential CapEx bills to pay as you think about what the rates are going to be. So how do you decide out of your CapEx profile there at Marine, given kind of the sizable bills the Navy is going to have to pay, and if they can pay those bills or not? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there is often chatter when we \u2013 and this has been true from the last time that we recapitalized our nuclear fleet, about the affordability of it. But this is really a national policy issue, and to the extent that the United States wants to maintain a nuclear deterrent, they've got to build this submarine. So that's number one. And that's my view. And I think that that's supported by many people in the government on both the Executive and the Congressional side. So I wouldn't say that Democratic \u2013 some chatter in the system suggest walking away from this requirement. So I think in terms of \u2013 the Navy has budgeted here a revenue flow to us that we can easily accommodate the CapEx and the other improvements that we have going forward in terms of the ability to build these. I might also tell you that we've been spending CapEx over the last few years to position ourselves, particularly at the Quonset Point, on the Ohio replacement. So we work very carefully with our Navy customer to determine what they need, what we need, the funding allocation, who's responsible for what, and we're certainly not going to get caught long. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Do you think ultimately you keep the Virginia rate at two per year? Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's the plan. In fact, we like that plan. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : I hear you. Okay. Great. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Erin Linnihan - Staff Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

(Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2016 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Erin. Good morning, all. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 for fully diluted share on revenue of $7.73 billion and income from continuing operations of $767 million. This is $0.20 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.10 per share better than consensus. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was down $263 million or 3.3%. Operating earnings are up $35 million, a 3.4% increase, and income from continuing operations is up $34 million, a 4.6% increase. This quarter's operating earnings of $1.07 billion reflect a 13.8% operating margin, 90 basis points better than the third quarter 2015. By the way, this is the eighth consecutive quarter that we've had both operating earnings and EBIT in excess of $1 billion. Sequentially, revenue is up $66 million, almost 1%. Operating earnings are essentially flat and operating margin is down 20 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is off $540 million, a 2.3% decrease. However, operating margins are up 50 basis points and earnings from continuing operations are up $54 million, a 2.5% increase, once again reflecting our emphasis on continuous improvement in operations. Earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.57 or 8.5% over last year. I should point out that the entirety of the year-to-date revenue decrease is attributable to Aerospace, as we forecasted in January. The defense businesses have actually shown some modest growth year-to-date. With respect to cash, we have $389 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 51% of net income from continuing operations. We have $1.1 billion year-to-date, 50% of net income from continuing operations. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $348 million, offset in part by the exercise of 1.5 million options. We have purchased approximately 11.2 million shares year-to-date for about $1.5 billion. This is consistent with our prior guidance that we would repurchase shares and pay dividends in amounts and somewhat in excess of this year's free cash flow, much as we did last year. As a reminder, in 2015, we had free cash flow of $1.9 billion and spent $4.1 billion on share repurchases and dividends. This year, we have spent $2.2 billion on share repurchases and dividend year-to-date compared to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion, a delta of $1.1 billion. We will continue to use our balance sheet prudently and appropriately for the rest of the year. In short, we are honoring our word in these two years of low cash flow and using our balance sheet to offset lower cash. As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, our very healthy backlog is holding nicely. Once again, there was good contract activity in all segments, with particularly strong order intake at Gulfstream. We ended the quarter with a total backlog for the company of $62 billion, down modestly from the end of last quarter. Of that amount, $51.4 billion is funded. Let me say a few words about each of our groups. Let me start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenue is down $326 million or 13.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015, in line with the production cuts to the G450, G550 and, to a lesser extent, the G280, that we had previously discussed with you. Also remember that Q3 2015 was the group's highest ever revenue quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings increased $11 million or 2.6% to $437 million on an operating margin of 21.7%, a 350 basis point improvement over the year-ago quarter. This is a real tribute to the operating efficiency of the Gulfstream and Jet Aviation teams. By the way, this is the ninth consecutive quarter with operating earnings in excess of $400 million and the highest ever margin for the group. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $117 million reduction in revenue, 5.5%, but a $3 million improvement in operating earnings and 140 basis point improvement in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $571 million or 8.5%. Operating earnings are down $14 million or 1.1%, a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin. On the call last quarter, we advised that we were quite optimistic regarding order activity in the third quarter. Our optimism was well founded. We had strong order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9:1 book-to-bill measure in dollar value of orders. Gulfstream alone was about 1 :1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on a number of units basis. The distribution of these orders is also attractive, with the G650 and 650ER leading the way. I can also tell you that our pipeline of prospects grew, and our active sales discussions are quite good. We are again reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look much like the third quarter. By the way, this was the strongest discrete third quarter since 2011 for orders. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter with revenue of $1.33 billion, operating earnings of $219 million and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue is off $15 million but earnings are up $1 million on a 30 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $15 million and operating earnings are flat. Year-to-date, revenue is down against 2015 by $198 million or 4.8%. Operating earnings are up $7 million or 1.1% on a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year, and we fully anticipate that their fourth quarter earnings will see a 30% increase in revenue. All of our major programs are performing very well in Combat. Our cost performance has improved. Our competitiveness positions us well for the future and through rest of the year, by the way. We continued to see opportunities for growth both internationally as allied nations continue to see increased emerging threats and domestically as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps begin to recapitalize their equipment. The Marine group reported revenue of $2.04 billion, a $44 million or 2.1% decrease compared to the year-ago quarter. However, revenue was up sequentially by $56 million or 2.8%. Year-to-date, revenue has increased by $130 million or 2.2% to $6.2 billion. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $166 million are down by $15 million compared to last year's quarter. The group's operating margins were down 60 basis in the quarter as a result of a onetime charge at Bath on their restart of the DDG 115 and DDG 116 program. This charge flows through to the sequential and year-to-date comparisons as well. IS&T, well, IS&T continues to outperform somewhat our revenue expectations. Revenue of $2.34 billion is up $122 million or 5.5% against last year's quarter and up $112 million sequentially, also a 5% increase. Year-to-date revenue of $6.9 billion is up $99 million or 1.5% over last year. Operating earnings of $256 million are up $37 million or 16.9% compared to the third quarter last year on the strength of a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings are up $12 million on a 10.9% operating margin in both quarter. Year-to-date operating earnings are up $75 million, an 11.1% increase on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a very good news story with both revenue and operating margins higher than expected. Really strong performance by IS&T. So, what does all this mean as far as the year is concerned? Well, stronger than expected operating results in the quarter, a lower than planned tax rate and modestly lower share count enabled us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operation goes from $9.70 to $9.75. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance. And finally in closing, as tempting as it is this time of year for some of you to ask about the following year, let me just remind you that we have a planning process in the fall when these businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. That guidance, which we give to you in January, is grounded in that process and as a result, it's full and thorough. So, I don't want to prematurely piecemeal at this juncture. I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll be brief as I've got just a few things to cover before we start the Q&A period. First, some background on the charge in discontinued operations. Back in 2013, we settled the 1991 litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in our former tactical military aircraft business, retiring in excess of $1 billion in potential risk to the company. In connection with that settlement, we provided various forms of consideration to the Navy including the release of some rights to the potential reimbursement of costs that affected all ships under contract at the time at our main shipyard. As we've progressed through the ship building process, we've determined that the cost associated with this settlement is greater than the parties anticipated. Therefore, we recognized an $84 million loss net of taxes to adjust the previously recognized settlement value. As we've discussed throughout this year, we're seeing an impact on our financial results from foreign exchange rate volatility. It's still not material in the aggregate, but it continues to be a slight top line drag on some of our segments, particularly Combat Systems. As Phebe pointed out, the group's revenue declined by 1.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015 but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the euro and the Canadian dollar held constant from 2015, the group's sales would have remained steady quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to interest expense, the net expense in the quarter was $23 million, similar to the third quarter of 2015. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $95 million. In July, we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with cash on hand and subsequently issued $1 billion of new debt in the quarter. Despite the net increase in long term notes, our net debt position remains unchanged from the end of the second quarter at approximately $1.6 billion. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion after deploying over $550 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. We funded our pension plan as expected in the quarter and continue to expect cash pension contributions for 2016 to approximate $200 million. Our effective tax rate was 26.8% for the quarter, somewhat lower than we expected as a result of tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and other true-ups associated with the filing of our tax return. For the full year, we expect an effective tax rate in the high 28% range. Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Erin Linnihan - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has the chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chelsea, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, Phebe, just a quick question. I know you don't want to get into much detail on 2017. But if I just rewind a little bit, I think in the past, you mentioned a goal, a longer-term goal of getting to double-digit earnings growth. If we think about the margin performance that the company has done this year, how should we think \u2013 is double-digit a reasonable starting place for 2017 when we think about where earnings could go? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Wow, so much for not getting into 2017. Look, we have, as a goal, double-digit growth, but it's too soon for me to tell how 2017 plays out. So, if you want to ask another question, go ahead. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. Okay. So, thank you for that. So, maybe just a follow-up on \u2013 in the quarter, you mentioned that sales at Gulfstream were good, right? And you have book-to-bill of 1 or over 1, depending on how you want to measure it. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Order. Yeah. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you give maybe a little more color on kind of regional distribution and how G650 was doing? Because as you know, there has been worry about sales of G650s, that kind of thing. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, you asked about the regional distribution, and I think it's worth stepping back a moment and talking in the general and then in the specific. And let's start by talking about the market, and let me try to give you some insight into our market. Let's start with, for example, the Honeywell study, which measures deliveries, not orders. Deliveries in the business jet market are down, including somewhat at Gulfstream, right? So, the good and valid reasons that we have discussed during our transition, discussed with you previously during our transition from the G450 and G550 to G650 or G550 and G600 or G500 and G600. Deliveries, however, are based on retrospective orders, so 12 to 24 months previously. And for Gulfstream, from an order perspective, we have seen and continue to see nice demands. So, it would appear that we have been taking share from others in our space and as the G500 and G600 enter into service, we really anticipate that we will continue to take share. I've been reluctant in the past year or so to get into a share discussion because we really are about \u2013 not about share but really about profit, but it would appear that we are indeed taking share. So, I think that understanding where we are positioned today and how our position going forward will help you. It would also appear, specifically to your question, that we are far less dependent on the BRIC countries and on, frankly, any one particular region outside North America. And our demand, consequently, has not been as perturbative as others have seemed to be. So, it gives you a sense of I think where we stand in the market and how we see it in general. Now, let's dig down a little bit deeper into Gulfstream, and let's just think about this. So, from a Gulfstream perspective, again as measured by our sales pipeline and order activity with respect to demand, both are stable and sufficient to get us through to the new aircraft. I mentioned that the third quarter orders are the strongest in five years and interestingly, both our fourth quarter activity to date and the pipeline are good. If we think about Gulfstream more specifically, let me talk to you and just give you a little bit of color without getting into guidance. This is just color in the most broad sense. The G500 will most certainly make a contribution in 2017 and a significant one in 2018. The amount of the 2017 contribution, of course, will be dependent on the timeliness of the certification. The G600 should make a contribution in 2018 and a significant contribution in 2019. So, why am I confident in talking to you all about this? I'll tell you why. It's because the test program for both airplanes are going very well. The G500 is doing well in tests and should be certified and entered into service in 2017, as implied by what we've just talked about. The G600 will fly this quarter and should be certified and enter into service, and all are on schedule with some forward bias. Thinking about, again, just broadly, our market in Gulfstream in particular, I've always been of the view that a new plane needs 50 solid orders before the commencement of initial production to have a good start. Well, the G500 is going to exceed that number, which is quite good, especially when you consider that our sales force has been incentivized to focus on the G450 and G550. They'll now be incentivized to turn their attention towards the G500. So, with respect to used airplanes, some of you have been very concerned about that. Let me talk to you a little bit about where we are in the used market. We see, in the G650 market, I think there are about 19 to 20 airplanes that are up for sale, but as we deconstruct and analyze those potential aircrafts, we see maybe 12 to 14 serious sellers, dedicated sellers. So, that's well within the 10% of the 200 and some \u2013 203, actually, G650s that we've got into service, and we haven't seen any impact this quarter on our new order activity or our order activity from the used market. And with respect to the G550, the used market is about 7% of the 700 or so aircraft in service and so, we haven't been affected by that either. So, I notice that was rather a soliloquy, but I think your question about the distribution of our market I think was particularly just \u2013 gave me an opportunity to talk to you guys a little bit more fulsomely about the market. So, I hope that helped. Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That does. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Phebe, I guess following up on that. You've talked about Gulfstream EBIT holding flat through this transition period. Is that still the official line given the pull forward on the \u2013 it sounds like a bit of a pull forward on the G500 and G600 and with the G450 going out of production? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, you're quite right. We said that we're going to try \u2013 we intended to keep earnings as flat as we could and the margins as high as we could during this transition period just to be a bit cyclical and frankly, so far, I think we've done a pretty good job. We'll get into 2017 after we set our production rates and got a little more clarity into the market, but that still remains our goal to give you those higher earnings as we possibly can and margins as high as we can. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Quick, quick follow-up. Marine \u2013 how much was the charge of Marine on the quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: It's not material. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: But I wanted to mention it to you so you just at least understood what was going on. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and congratulations. Terrific performance at Gulfstream. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Cai. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Can you explain to me, I mean, for the deliveries that you made, which were pretty much in line where we were guessing, we had less profit by $30-million-plus. So, was it lower R&D? Was it supplier payments? Was it forfeitures? Was it better margins? What got you to a number that strong and is that likely to repeat in the fourth quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, as we've talked before, Aerospace margins and Gulfstream, in particular, are variable quarter-over-quarter. But what you're seeing here is a result of the Gulfstream team doing a superb job taking costs out as their revenue has declined. And they've done a very good job at that in the quarter. R&D was somewhat lower. We had some timing issues at Jet Aviation. I don't anticipate that performance going forward in margins, but they will continue to do quite well. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just a quick one on how you think about the transition to the G500, G600 from a margin or a cost standpoint, I guess. Clearly, it's come out that you'll end the G450 production in 2018, and you just made a comment about the contribution you expect from the G500 and G600 and how that layers in, in 2017 and 2018. But with those aircraft being produced in different facilities, how should we think about the ramp down on the G450, and then eventually the G550 and how that impacts the overall cost structure of the segment? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. We've talked the last year or so about how we're going to manage the transition as we wind down the G450 and G550 and then bring on the G500 and G600. And the key there is matching the shipsets, the wings, the fuselage, the engines with the number of airplanes that we have left to sell or left to deliver. And so far, with the G150 for example, we got it spot on. We're on track to get that perfect correlation on the G450 and I expect the same thing on the G550. So, I don't anticipate any decrease in margins as a result of our failure to make that transition really comfortable and profitable. That said, as we, look, think about it. Any time you have a mix shift, which is what Gulfstream's going to have, right. You're going to have a mix shift as we go from older production, long-running lines, long historic learning curves, as we enter and start to produce and deliver G500s and G600s. But I will tell you, if you look at the G650 by comparison, and let's just use that as our baseline, the G650 margin performance was faster and higher than the G550 before it. So, that means it's coming down its learning curve and we're seeing gross margin expansion earlier than we had ever before. So, the lessons that we have learned on the G650, we are translating into how we go about the production on the G500 and G600, and that gives me an awful lot of confidence that this team is going hit the ground running. They have some margin compression as we begin to deliver, as we come down those learning curves, but our ability to come down those learning curves as we've demonstrated, I believe is going to go much, much faster. And remember too, there's a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and G600. So, I suspect that the ignition coming down, when we bring that G600 into full wave production, it's going to be pretty impressive. I got to tell you, I like where we are. I like where we're headed. We're moving through this transition period like I told you we were going to do, and we're in good shape for real revenue and earnings growth as we get these two new airplanes into service. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Phebe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems. You made a comment about the sequential growth you're going to see in the fourth quarter. And just to get to your annual guidance, you do need something like a 35% sequential increase. So, can you talk a little bit about what drives that? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So, the fourth quarter revenue increase is driven primarily by a couple of things. The Canadian, Mid East order and our AJAC programs as they move from engineering and low rate production in the third quarter into full rate production in the fourth quarter. So you're going to see some real \u2013 and by the way, we got this \u2013 Combat has this analyzed down to a fine level of detail, and we have that growth in our backlog and we are positioned on both of those programs. So those are going to drive it primarily. But recall also Combat tends to have very robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter across the portfolio, and we'll continue to see that in OTS and ELS as well as Land Systems. So, there isn't much ambiguity this late in the year with the group that really understands their products and how they're going to then begin to execute. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And if I can follow-up a question just in terms of the other Mid East Abrams order that Congress has been pushing back on. Is there a certain timeframe when that has to come in until it starts to affect your production? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, I'm not sure why you think they're pushing back on it. Frankly, they approved. If you're talking about the 100, in September, they approved the 133 M1A2 Saudi Main Battle Tank request, so that's good to go, it at contract. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Phebe, I'm curious about that comment you made about the sales force having their incentives change around the new programs slipping to the G500 and G600 from the G450, G550. Can you help me understand a little bit how, first of all, when that happened? And how material of a change is this in their own lives? Is this like a significant driver of their compensation structure? Or is this a small thing in their bonus? I'm just kind of trying to think about ... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well look, I'm not going to get into how we pay them. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : No. I don't want to know how much money they make, but just... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: But to give you a sense, just in general it's the case here is that the sales force is incentivized to sell whatever products we, at the moment, are focused on. And so their bonuses are a significant part of their compensation and it's up to us to give them the direction of where we're going have them focus. So, this has been a very effective sales force as I think you can see from our order activity. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Oh, sure. Did this change within the last few months? Or has this been in there for six, nine months, something like that? Or is it just like something a change effective at the end of the year? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, think about it. The G450 we've announced \u2013 that line is going to end, surprisingly, right? These replacement aircrafts, by definition, are going to replace airplanes that we're winding down and the G550 has continued to have very nice order activity. So, we're pretty confident that it's time now to move more robustly to the G500. And let me tell you, even incentivized as they were, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have sold quite a few. So, we're in pretty good shape here. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Hi, Phebe. I'm so inclined to ask a Gulfstream question, but you've answered them all. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Oh, go ahead. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: No. I won't do that. Instead, talk a little bit about Information Systems and Technology. I mean, you've stated that there has been a change and it's sort of taking on your growth profile. Can you elaborate a little bit upon what some of the pillars are that are behind this and how you'd like to shape it going forward? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right. Let me kind of take that in two parts. And let's start with our book-to-bill because I think that that reflects a lot of different moving parts. In the quarter, we had a book-to-bill about 0.8:1, and that's solid for this short-cycle business. And think about it in terms of the last eight quarters, or eight of the last 11 quarters for this group have had a 1 :1 or greater book-to-bill, which is really quite exceptional in the short term for short, these highly transactional businesses. So, that gives us the platform for some of this ignition. And in terms of where we're focused, on our platform side, we've got a number of growth opportunities across our platform portfolio. In our ISR business and space payload markets, cyber, nuclear weapons and avionics. So, I like where they are there. On our IT side, we have had nice book-to-bills, and we've got a number of wins that we've had across the entirety of the portfolio. And I'll tell you, if you remember, we also have the census in there, which would be a nice cost plus award fee program for five years, and we like how that fits into our low risk cash generating portfolio. And then going forward, we've got an awful lot of competitions coming up, and we tend to announce those as we win them or we put them into our backlog. So, the diving board for our growth is there in our backlog, and because these businesses have really reduced their cost and increased their competitiveness, their book-to-bill has been wholesome for quite some time now and I expect it to be going forward. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: And then actually, I do want to, as a follow-up, you know if you do the flight hours on the G500, you're clearly ahead of schedule. Can you provide us a little bit of an indication of when you think in the first half of 2017 you might get the cert? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I think first half is a touch ambitious, but I'll be able to give you in January a lot more clarity when we get the full certification timeline from the FAA. But I'm very confident we're going to cert in 2017. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask on Marine, on the Ohio Class Replacement Program, because the scale of that program is so large that one would expect it to transform Electric Boat in the next decade, and particularly if we see Virginia class stay stay at two per year. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That's my view. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, when you look at it \u2013 can you talk about the general trajectory of revenues and earnings over the next five years as you move toward the first ship? And also, what investments might be needed to really set Electric Boat up for the scale of operations that will ultimately be there? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: All right. Let me give you a little bit \u2013 because this is such a big program, let me give you a little bit of detail on what's going on, on the Ohio Replacement. We have had the design contract now for about five years, and we're proceeding nicely apace. As you know, we're the prime contractor for the design but not the sole contractor, and the prime contractor for the construction. So, our schedule is right on point to start the conception of the lead ship in 2021, and I would imagine that \u2013 well, I expect that our profile on revenue between now and 2021 where we'll really begin to see the real ignition, will be driven by a couple of things. One, we'll continue to have further design work on the Ohio, which will begin to ramp down as we get closer and closer. But starting perhaps in 2019 \u2013 I think we're anticipating 2019 \u2013 we're likely to see long lead production, so we can actualize the ship production construction in 2021. So, as you know, these submarine programs take \u2013 require a fair amount of long lead material in order to ensure that you stay on your construction schedule. So, to give you a sense of where we in the design and the component development. Well, we have proposed a detailed design and, actually, all the component development design to the Navy earlier this summer, and they'd like to give us an award by the end of the year. And you know what, when you think about these large nationally strategic programs, one of the most important things that we all get right is that the costs are well understood. And so one of the things that's been driving our work the last three years is a bottom-up analysis of the full cost of construction. So that'll be an important element as we work through those costs with the Navy. And once we get some clarity about the schedule and the pace, then we'll be able to have more clarity about specifics on that production ramp because it will all be very public and obvious. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: When you look at Electric Boat though, this will really change what the operations look like up there. I mean, how do you think about planning for that? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well look, I'm sorry, you did ask that, my fault. We have begun making the investments over the last five years. The investments are primarily funded by the Navy, but we will also and have been putting some of our capital in and will continue to because, well look, we invest in lines of business that have high returns for us and good returns for us and this is one of those lines of business, and it is transformative. You put Ohio on top of Virginia and there's going be quite a lot of workload. So we have spent the last five years both getting our facilities in place. Our design tools are mature. the design to build tools are also very mature, and we need to get our work force because we're going to have this increase in volume. We're going to be bringing in a fair number of green labor. We have a robust education program in the trades with Rhode Island and Connecticut and that will provide us the foundation to really be able to start full rate production on schedule on the Ohio Replacement and continue on Virginia class. Shipbuilding, one of the competitive advantages in shipbuilding is that detailed planning is critical, and that's something that Electric Boat has excelled at for decades and has demonstrated yet again in their preparation for the Ohio. So we have detailed hiring plans, training plans, CapEx plans with the Navy, and of course our design work that we also have in lock step with the Navy on. So, this is all about preparing for success and so far, so good. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First one is a clarification. Phebe. I think you said that you were going to do repurchase and dividends slightly ahead of your free cash flow. I just wanted to clarify, and maybe I misunderstood. I thought previously it was the 100% of the net income and you kind of make up the difference for repurchase in cash flow. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So Myles, I think we've used a couple different terms in the past. We've talked about normalizing versus the lower free cash flow in these couple of years. But I think the key point is we had had a tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet coming into the past couple years. A lot of that was timing for a number of the things that we've talked about over the past several quarters. And at this point, the key is we are committed to using that balance sheet to again sort of normalizing that free cash flow at a lower level to return that capital. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: And look, think about it this way, we've long been talking about these two years of fairly low cash flow. We need to normalize that cash flow and augment it by our balance sheet and we've done that. I think about it more like, where are we in cash flow, where are we on the balance sheet, and what resources do we have to continue to go buy shares and other investments as needed. And I think we've managed that pretty prudently. So I think about it as where our cash flow is and where are our cash deployment, where our cash flow is and what our balance sheet looks like and we've been pretty consistent. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And the conversion for 2016 you think can still get close to the 2015 conversion level at 65%. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We'll have to see on that. But we've got plenty of powder on our balance sheet. So, there's been no material change from the guidance that we gave you back in January about our cash flow. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Think about it that way. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. On the cash flow, you've had this drawdown on the advances in Combat Systems on the large contracts you talked about before. The Middle East lab and the AJACs and you've got the growth in Q4, but does that trend continue next year? Is there any concern that the Middle East customer might slow the intake of deliveries especially as those cash advances get exhausted and just given lower \u2013 the potentially scarcer resources over there? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, let's talk about the Middle East for a moment in general. And this particular customer, we have had a 50-year productive relationship with the Kingdom. And the vast preponderance of all of our combat programs are government-to-government and the contracts have been \u2013 products have been fully vetted and supported and these all happen to be products that the customer wants and needs. So, we have seen no indication from the end-user customer that there is concern on their part or an intent on their part to change the profile of these \u2013 of our deliveries. And look, we will \u2013 we got these large advances and we've been working those down and then we'll continue to refresh cash flow as we \u2013 from these customers as we increase deliveries. And so far, we're in pretty good shape. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And if I could just ask one more, Phebe, maybe for Jason, but a follow-up to Doug's question. On this design release, on Columbia, Ohio Replacement that's upcoming, could \u2013 if the timing is there and the CR doesn't get in the way, could that be an inflow about $700-million-plus of design money to you by the end \u2013 before the end of the year or maybe early next year? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Look, we will work with the Navy. I haven't planned on and haven't looked at the specific timing of the cash flow with respect to that order \u2013 of that contract, because we don't have the contract signed yet. So, as soon as we get that contract, we'll have real clarity about the timing quarter-by-quarter of when we can expect the cash associated with that. But there's no way to estimate at the moment until that contract is signed. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. The reason I ask is because it sounds like DoD could be making some kind of decision in early November. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, they are. They're making their Milestone B decision, which is predicated on that submission that we just made on the components \u2013 detail design and component design. So, that is a trigger. But once that decision is made, then you got a good contract, right? Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: And Chelsea, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning. Phebe, just a quick clarification. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said you have got 50 orders on the G500? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No. What I said was that it has been my experience that you \u2013 to have a successful launch of a new airplane, you need to have 50 orders before entry into service and we on our way to exceed that amount. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That helps? Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, it does. Thank you very much. And then, looking out to 2018, you suggested that the G500 will contribute in that year and then meaningfully \u2013 excuse me, in 2017 and meaningfully in 2018. You've also suggested in the past that you've got some delivery slots that are available on the G650 out there in the second quarter of 2018. Just wondering if you could update us on that. And what I'm trying to figure out here is whether you're going have enough in the orders on the G650 to hold production flat out there in 2018? Or if the plan here is to begin taking production rates down on that and having any hole from an EBIT perspective that gets created by the G650 decline and then filled in by the G500 and that's kind of the key to the recipe of holding EBIT flat through these transitions? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, what we said all along is that \u2013 we use that wonderful word feather \u2013 we'll feather in additional G650s. But that production rate during the transition is not sustainable nor healthy and that we would never intend to keep that production rate up. What we aim for is to keep our backlog on G650s on any of our programs, particularly that one, between 18 months and two years and we're now at two years again. So, as we think about that, I mean, that order book is there for the two \u2013 we've got now two years next available, so that ought to give you a little bit of color on how we intend to think through as we set our deliveries and our delivery schedule. But I have not set, and we haven't set until later \u2013 late November or mid-November our production schedule for next year. So, on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you copious detail what we plan on doing. Okay? Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, Erin can be reached at 703-876-3583. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Baird Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital David Strauss - UBS Howard Rubel - Jefferies Operator : Welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Erin Linnihan, Staff VP for Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Linnihan : Thank you, Gary and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. As always any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thanks, Erin and good morning. I'd like to open by congratulating Phebe on welcoming her first grandchild into the world yesterday. Mother, son and grandmother are all doing well. Phebe is with the newest edition to her family right now, but she left us well-prepared to report our results on this call. I'd also like to welcome Kim Kuryea, our Vice President and Controller to the call and thank her for joining me today. Congratulations Phebe, welcome Kim, now let's get started.  Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.62 per fully diluted share, on revenue of $8.23 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $807 million. The results for the quarter beat analyst consensus by $0.08, mostly on a lower than anticipated tax provision. Revenue and operating earnings are up significantly against the year-ago quarter, by 5.4% and 7.8% respectively.  Earnings from continuing operations are also up $43 million on the strength of a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.22 or 9.2%. So in summary, against the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue is up 5.4%, operating earnings are up 7.8%, earnings from continuing operations are up 5.6% and fully diluted earnings per share are up 9.2%.  Sequentially, the story is just as wholesome. Revenue is up $502 million or 6.5% and operating earnings are up $48 million or 4.5%. Earnings from continuing operations are also up by $40 million and similarly, earnings per fully diluted share are up $0.14.  So all-in all a very solid quarter, with good performance all around. The marine group's improved performance, both quarter over quarter and sequentially, is notable. In short, we were very pleased with the quarter. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.87, on revenue of $31.35 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 billion. We had full-year margins of 13.7%, a record for GD. Revenue for the year is down $116 million, somewhat less than 0.5%. Operating earnings on the other hand are up $131 million or 3.1%, on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins.  Earnings from continuing operations are up $97 million or 3.3%. This, together with share repurchase activity and a lower than anticipated effective tax rate, led quite naturally to an 8.7% improvement in diluted earnings per share. This was a very good year, a year of continuing improvement, a year of accomplishment.  Free cash flow from operations is $678 million in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $1.81 billion which is 59% of earnings from continuing operations. As we had advised you at the beginning of the year, free cash flow from operations was not going to be as robust as is typical for us. It was in fact less than 100% of net earnings. This happened for two reasons.  First, we were working off the very large advanced payments received in late 2014 on a major combat systems program. And second, we expected an increase in operating working capital at Gulfstream, consistent with building numerous test aircraft and pre-production parts in connection with the G500 and G600 programs. All of this will normalize and unwind quite positively, beginning this year. In 2017 we expect free cash flow to be approximately 100% of net income give or take a little. We should keep this kind of cash performance up throughout the planning horizon.  Let me briefly give you some color on the quarter in each of the business groups. First, aerospace. Revenue was up both quarter over quarter and sequentially. Against the year-ago quarter, sales are up $82 million or 3.8% and operating earnings are up $26 million or 6.3%, as a result of a 50 basis point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $207 million or 10.3% and operating earnings are essentially flat, as a result of the anticipated compression in operating margin.  For the year, revenue is $8.36 billion and operating earnings are $1.72 billion, with an operating margin of 20.5%. This is a year-over-year reduction of 5.5% in sales, almost $500 million, but operating earnings are up $12 million for the year on 120 basis point improvement in margins. All in all, a very good year at aerospace, with strong operating leverage and decent order intake, particularly good in the last half of the year. This result was consistent with our guidance to you that we would hold earnings even with 2015. As I mentioned, earnings were actually up $12 million over 2015. Order activity in the quarter was good and pipeline activity was actually robust. The book-to-bill at aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to 1 dollar-based and 0.9 to 1 in units of green delivery at Gulfstream.  All in all, the order activity going into the first quarter of this year is quite good. The second half of 2016 was actually strong from a pace of activity standpoint and interest in the G500 and G600 is increasing nicely, as we get closer to entry into service with these aircraft.  At combat systems, revenue was $1.68 billion and is up $160 million or 10.5% and operating earnings are up $25 million or 10.7% on a quarter-over quarter basis. Sequentially, the story is even better. Sales are up $354 million or 26.6% and operating earnings are up $40 million or 18.3%.  For the full year, sales are down $38 million or 0.7%; however operating earnings are up $32 million or 3.6%, on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat lower revenue and stronger operating margins.  Overall, combat systems is a story of revenue reasonably consistent with expectations and outstanding cost and margin performance. As you'll learn later in my remarks, this is a business group poised for quite significant growth in the 2017 to 2020 time frame, as we begin delivering on our backlog.  Marine group revenue of $2.04 billion in the quarter is up $59 million or 3%, compared to the year-ago quarter and essentially flat on a sequential basis. Operating earnings are up $14 million or 8.1% against the year-ago quarter and up $20 million or 12% sequentially.  Revenue for the year is up $189 million or 2.4%. Recall that this year's $189 million increase in annual revenue follows a $701 million increase in 2015 and a $600 million increase in 2014. That's more than 20% growth for the group over that three-year period.  On the other hand, operating earnings for the year are down $3 million on a 30 basis point reduction in operating margins, so the story here is a good quarter on both a quarter-over quarter and sequential basis. On an annual basis, we experienced better than anticipated revenue, but not as good as expected operating margin which left us relatively flat year over year.  In the information systems and technology group, revenue in the quarter is $2.28 billion up $123 million or 5.7% against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $244 million in the quarter are 6.1% better than the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are down $12 million or 4.7% on a 20 basis point reduction in margins and a 2.4% reduction in sales.  For the year, revenue was up $222 million or 2.5% and earnings are up $89 million or 9.9%, on the strength of a 70 basis point improvement in margins, very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year, we forecast flat operating earnings for the group, so this was a very strong year for IS&T.  On this call a year ago, on a Company-wide basis, our guidance for 2016 was to expect revenue of $31.6 billion to $31.8 billion, an operating margin rate of 13.3% and a tax rate of 29.5% and return on sales of 9.1%. We wound up the year light on revenue with $31.35 billion, but we exceeded our earnings expectation with operating margins of 13.7%, an effective tax rate of 27.6% and a return on sales of 9.8%.  Last year at this time, we provided EPS guidance of $9.20. We wound up at $9.87, $0.67 better. About $0.23 of the improvement came from better than planned operating performance, $0.25 from a lower than planned tax rate and the balance, about $0.19, from a lower share count as a result of share repurchases. Certainly, a very solid year by any measure.  So before we go to guidance, I want Kim to make a few remarks and then talk about the fundamentals of our accounting rule adoption for 2017 and the restatement of 2016 under these new revenue recognition rules. All of the guidance I'll offer you for 2017 and for 2018 through 2020 as well, will flow from the restatement of 2016 which is found in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of the press release. Kim? Kim Kuryea : Thanks, Jason and good morning. I'll start out by touching on just a few miscellaneous items related to 2016's financial performance. The first thing I'll note is the foreign exchange rate volatility that we've seen throughout 2016. In particular, this issue has had a negative impact on the growth experienced in our combat systems group, given their increasing international activity. As Jason pointed out, the group's full year revenue was down 0.7% compared to 2015, but had foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, held constant from 2015, the group sales would have actually increased by 1.5% in 2016. As a reminder, this has nothing to do with any economic exposure or losses. What we're talking about is merely the translation of our various international businesses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes and the negative effect on that translation that comes with the strengthening U.S. dollar.  Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, interest expense was $91 million, versus $83 million in 2015. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt, yielding more interest expense and about a $450 million reduction in our cash balance associated with capital deployment activities which resulted in slightly lower interest income.  For 2017, we expect net interest expense of around $110 million. The increase is due to the full-year effect of the increased debt and the lower cash positions. We ended 2016 with a cash balance of $2.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.6 billion. That compares with cash of almost $2.8 billion and net debt of about $600 million at the end of 2015. Those changes are attributable to our capital deployment activities which I'll walk through in just a minute.  Our effective tax rate was 27.6% for the year, very consistent with our 2015 effective rate of 27.7%. Our 2016 outcome was lower than anticipated, principally due to the higher than expected benefits from increased international activity and employee stock option exercises during the year. As we look forward to 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 28%, reflecting the fact that our international activity continues to increase and the tax benefit associated with stock options being a permanent part of the tax landscape. Let's move on to our pension plans. We contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2016, as forecast. For 2017, we expect that amount to be about the same, to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. A quick note on discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter, we had a net $10 million loss in discontinued operations to record an accrual for an environmental matter related to a business we divested back in the early 1980s. Finally, to summarize our activities on the capital deployment front for the year, we spent approximately $2 billion to repurchase 14.2 million shares in 2016, at an average price of a little less than $143 per share. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we disbursed $2.9 billion in shareholder-friendly actions in 2016 or 1.6 times our free cash flow from operations for the year.  Okay, that wraps up the discussion of 2016's financial performance and some expectations for interest expense, tax and pension contributions. Now, I'd like to move on to an explanation of our 2017 accounting change.  On January 1 of this year, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard, ASC topic 606 which addresses revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard outlines a five-step model to determine how and when to recognize revenue on a contract-by-contract basis.  For the vast majority of our contracts, we will continue to recognize revenue over time, similar to what we've done in the past, under the percentage of completion method. But for contracts that don't qualify for overtime revenue recognition, we'll recognize revenue at a single point in time.  As we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q and in today's press release exhibits, we expect this new standard to have two notable impacts on our contract portfolio. The first change relates to how we will account for adjustments in our estimates associated with our long term contracts. Starting in 2017, we'll utilize what's called the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This is similar to what others in our industry have done for many years.  In 2016 and prior, we use what's called the reallocation method for recognizing changes in profit on our contracts. This meant that any changes in profit we anticipated on our long term contracts were recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, rather than immediately when identified under the cumulative catch-up method. As a result of this change, we may see larger and more variable impacts from period to period from adjustments in contract estimates, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period, such as in our marine systems group. The second notable change that the new standard will have on our financial statements is in our aerospace group, specifically at Gulfstream. Starting in 2017, we'll have one revenue recognition point for Gulfstream aircraft, when the customer accepts the outfitted aircraft at entry into service.  This is different than the revenue recognition model we utilized in 2016 and before. Our past practice had two revenue recognition points at two distinct contractual milestones, green aircraft delivery and final outfitted delivery. It's important to note that these two changes and any other changes brought about by the standard impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings and do not alter our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts. Now to prepare for an effective discussion of our 2017 guidance which is based on the new method of revenue recognition, we need a consistent foundation as a point of comparison. Therefore, we restated our 2016 results as if we had been on the new revenue recognition standard for all of 2016. You can see the restated results for 2016 in Exhibits K-1 through K-3 of our press release.  Throughout 2017, as we speak with you and report in our Form 10-Qs, we'll compare our 2017 financial information to the restated 2016 results, so all of our comparisons will be on the same basis. I don't intend to walk you through all of the changes that you can see by examining the exhibits to our press release, but as you can see on Exhibit K-1 for 2016, as restated, both our consolidated revenue and operating earnings decline against the as-reported numbers. Similarly, the margin rate and diluted earnings per share follows suit. The biggest driver of this change is in aerospace. Please refer to Exhibit K-3 in our press release. Since under the new standard, revenue at Gulfstream is now driven by outfitted deliveries, our restated 2016 revenue is lower, as we had fewer outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. Operating earnings are similarly impacted. Likewise, operating margins go down due to mix shift between outfitted deliveries and the green deliveries.  On the other hand, as we disclosed in our third quarter Form 10-Q, the impact on 2015 would have been just the opposite, because in that year, there were more outfitted deliveries than green deliveries. There is no other change in cost, pricing, R&D, SG&A spend or services revenue or margins. This is strictly related to the timing of the aircraft deliveries.  So the question is, how will all of this impact aerospace in 2017? Well, Jason will give you detailed guidance shortly, but in general, some of the 2016 green deliveries, in excess of the completed deliveries, should deliver in the first quarter, thereby giving the first quarter a boost versus the restated fourth quarter. That will be offset later in the year as we experience planned green deliveries that do not enter into service during the year. This natural phenomenon will be exacerbated by a number of green G500s that will not have revenue recognized at green delivery because of the new rule.  So on balance, for the year, a modest accounting headwind for 2017. In short, the impact of these changes depends on the number and the mix of green versus outfitted deliveries, in any period. Okay, let me wrap up by reminding you of something that I mentioned earlier in this discussion. This is about an accounting change that in some circumstances alters when we recognize revenue and earnings, but does not impact our operations, our cash flows or the overall profitability of our contracts.  When you sit back and think about the restatement of 2016 and prior, everything that's occurred and been reported up to that point, may have shifted around between the quarterly and annual reporting period, but if you look to the end of 2016 and recognize that the operating activities and cash flows of the Company are unchanged up to that point, this is all about timing. We just have to look at the past through a new lens, so that we can have a meaningful comparison to our future results.  Jason, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you to address the 2017 guidance. Jason Aiken : Okay thanks, Kim. So let me provide some guidance for 2017 and some commentary on 2018 through 2020, initially by business group and then a Company-wide roll up. This year, we did a more detailed and extensive planning exercise around the three-year period subsequent to 2017, so I want to take this opportunity to share with you our expectations for that period, as well.  In Aerospace, we expect 2017 revenue to be $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016 as restated, but coincidentally similar to 2016 as reported. Operating earnings will be approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. The margin rate is somewhat lower than prior experience under the legacy accounting rules, as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending, as well as an anticipated increase in pre-owned aircraft sales.  In aerospace for the five year period, 2016 through 2020, that is 2016 as restated, we expect the sales CAGR of 5.3%. That CAGR rolls up modest sales increases in 2018 and 2019, with significant growth in 2020. For the same period, the operating earnings CAGR is expected to be 5.9%. These percentages are of course imply a degree of precision that isn't possible in out-year forecasting, however, we believe they are directionally accurate. In combat systems, we expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% in 2017, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. This implies a margin rate of around 15.6%. For the period 2016 to 2020, the expected sales CAGR is about 8.7% and earnings CAGR about 9.6%.  Combat systems is in a period where several of our international programs are migrating from development, prototyping and low rate initial production, into full scale production. This supports the growth rates I just discussed. The marine group is expected to have revenue of $7.9 billion, a reduction of 2.6% against 2016, as restated. Operating earnings in 2017 are anticipated to be $680 million to $685 million, with an operating margin rate around 8.6%. The 2016 to 2020 sales CAGR is expected to be 5%, with the strongest year-over-year growth in 2018. The expected earnings CAGR for the marine group for 2016 to 2020 is about 9%.  Finally in IS&T, we expect a modest improvement in revenue in 2017 and operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a 2016 to 2020 CAGR for sales and earnings of 4.5% and 5.3% respectively. So Company-wide, all of this rolls up to $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion of revenue, up over 2016 restated numbers by more than 2.5%. Operating earnings of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion, up over 2016 by about 11.5%. And operating margin around 13.3%, about 110 basis points above 2016 restated.  Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 28% tax provision as Kim mentioned and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55 for fully-diluted shares, up about 10% over 2016 under the new accounting rules.  With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, it's a bit more balanced than most years. Divide our guidance by four, then take $0.10 off the first quarter, $0.05 off the second quarter, add $0.05 to the third quarter and add $0.10 to the fourth quarter and that should give you the rough progression.  So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to capital deployment, we anticipate using all of our free cash flow in 2017 for dividends and share repurchases which will give a boost to the EPS guidance I've just given you. The amount of that boost will depend on the timing and share price.  For the period 2016 to 2020, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 5.6% and an operating earnings CAGR of 7.1%. This is simply a roll up of the projections I've given you for the business groups, so we're quite bullish about 2018 through 2020 in all segments.  Now, let me end my remarks there and we'll start taking your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Jason Gursky : Jason, maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on the dynamics that you've seen at Gulfstream, starting off with the perhaps order activity on the 500 and 600, what you saw in the quarter? You talked a little bit about a robust pipeline and then just talk about the profitability there and the trajectory for that into the out years. We talked about $1.6 billion for this year with a nice CAGR going forward. So what does the shape of that hockey stick look like as we move out into 2020? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Sure, so look as it relates to order activity, as I mentioned, we really saw a very encouraging increase in velocity in the second half of the year and that really is representative across the entire model portfolio, including the new products. I think what we're seeing here is, as we expected, as both the G500 and G600 get closer to entry into service, we're starting to see that order interest continue to pick up, so we feel very good about where those airplanes are as they get closer to the EIS, their respective EIS dates.  Overall as I said it's not just order activity which again we felt very good about in both the third and fourth quarters, but it's the velocity into what we think of as the pipeline. What comes in sometimes is not the same as what goes out. We have talked about extended or protracted contract negotiations and the timing it takes to get aircraft contracts signed and completed and as good as we saw the second half from an order perspective, we saw just as encouraging velocity from the pipeline perspective going into Q1 which gives us a good bit of optimism as we start this year from an order perspective. With respect to your question about the out years, as I mentioned you saw you heard the remarks on 2017 and the CAGR for the out year period, I think what we see is, as we're transitioning with the real ramp of the 500 starting in 2018 and the 600 starting in 2019, we'll see modest growth in each of those years from their respective entries into service and we'll see more of the acceleration of the growth starting in 2020, when both of them are fully up and have ramped into the production. Operator : The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Sam Pearlstein : Jason, can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow conversion you mentioned, returning to 100% in 2017? It's a multi-part but does it continue through the planning period and can you address CapEx specifically over that period? Because I'm just trying to think about how CapEx ramps around the Columbia class ramp-up during that period. Jason Aiken : Sure, certainly, as we've been signaling through this couple of year period, where we have seen lighter than our traditional cash flow conversion, it has been our expectation, our forecast that we would be back to our traditional 100% conversion rate starting in 2017. We have a high degree of confidence in that and we actually do see that as a sustaining trend. This is not a one-time thing, but we do expect to be able to keep up that level of conversion in that range throughout this planning horizon that I described.  As it relates to free cash flow or excuse me, CapEx, typically somewhere in the ballpark of 2% of revenues is where we tend to end up around CapEx. That of course depends upon the timing and phasing of various projects across the business, so it can perturbate a little bit back and forth. But certainly what's coming on the horizon with Ohio will bring with it some investment. We're still in the very early phases of discussing what the profile and timing of that looks like with the Navy and so I don't think we're prepared to discuss any type of outsized CapEx investment in any one year, beyond what I just described. But it certainly, we do not see it affect any of that overall conversion rate through the planning horizon that I just described. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Jason, on Gulfstream is there a way that looks like to quantify how many jets have shifted out of 2016 into 2017? Looks like from a completion standpoint it's more like 10 aircraft. Is there a way you can help us bridge that? And then also regarding just a clarification on the G500 expecting certification this year and initial green deliveries, are we expecting any completed deliveries? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Sure. So you're pretty much right as it relates to the green aircraft shifting from 2016 into 2017 and that's really what Kim was alluding to. Again do keep in mind that green aircraft will shift, including G500 green aircraft, will shift from 2017 into 2018. So this is something that I think is more of an issue in this immediate transition as you try to think about 2016 prior to restatement and 2016 under the restatement and then how you take that restated 2016 to then project 2017.  I will point out one notion. Of the number you see in those exhibits around the difference, the delta between the green and outfitted airplanes. We do have a number of, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but a number of aircraft that are associated with special mission programs and those get inducted directly into the special mission process and don't go through a completion, so there's a natural delta there and I'm sure Erin can give you numbers after the call, if we need to get into that level of detail.  As it relates to the G500 certification, we're still on track this year. Everything is going well with the flight test program and we're still targeting certification and entry into service, meaning outfitted delivery prior to the end of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Myles Walton : Jason, the restatement in the accounting had a material impact on the non Aerospace businesses on 2016, but I think in the Q, as related to the restatement of 2015, it didn't really. So can you walk us through why the restatement had the effect on 2016 but not on 2015 in a material way and walk us through that one? Jason Aiken : Sure. Look, as Kim described there really is just one primary meaningful difference that we're talking about as it relates to the defense businesses. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to understate what the team has done here to go through this process, because there's a lot of smaller puts and takes, but the big ticket item is this move from the prospective method of accounting for these changes in our long term estimates, to the cumulative catch up method.  So the issue there is there's no one thing you can point to, that can say this is directionally indicative from a trend perspective. Because what's happening here, every quarter every year across the portfolio of these programs, we're performing updates to our estimates to complete and we're making adjustments across that portfolio to our profit booking rate margins on those programs. So as we do that in a given quarter, you're going to have some programs go up, some programs go down. As you've seen with a number of our peers who have pretty much all been on this method, even prior to this point, that can lead to somewhat more volatility under the cumulative catch up method than we have experienced under the perspective method. I think you can reasonably expect somewhere in the reporter of magnitude, if you compare them to us historically, 2 times or so the level of quarterly profit adjustment-type impacts on the results.  Am I saying, that's what we will see in the future? I wouldn't be foolish enough to try and predict that but it's all going to depend what happens in a given quarter. What you saw in 2016 was that there were a handful more profit rate adjustments that had little to any impact under the prospective method in those periods, but when you take them all in one lump sum, they just drove a little bit more of that anomaly, a little bit more of that perturbation from quarter to quarter. So this is what we're going to frankly have to get into in a little more detail with you in the future, when and if these things happen. And as we said, we fully expect that somewhat increased level on volatility on a quarterly basis, to be part of our story in the future. Operator : The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ron Epstein : Just maybe a broader big picture question, when you're willing to offer a plan like that, that goes out a couple years, a lot of companies won't do that and it's a change for you, obviously. How do we think about the conservatism that's built in as you step out over year one, year two, year three? Given I'm certain you are conservative, but how should we think about the conservatism built in that you are willing to share that with us? Does that make any sense? Jason Aiken : It does. I would suggest this up front. There's nothing that's changed about anything you can infer about the historic current or future conservatism of this Company. It is what it is. I think the couple key points, those longer term out year CAGRs and forecasts that I directionally gave you, those are strictly rolled up from the operating plan, as submitted by our business units. So this is what each of those individual business unit presidents sees, as they look out over their horizon, mine their backlog and determine the trajectory of their businesses. We're seeing, frankly, a very good news story that we're bullish on across that period and so given the restatement here in the period and the fact that you're having to retune 2016 as you now look at and evaluate 2017, we frankly just thought it would be useful for you to get a little bit more of a picture, so you weren't left in isolation with the two data points make a trend or not, because that could be a tough expectation for anybody assessing the results.  So we wanted to show you a little bit more directional color on where we see the businesses going. And we think as we see that type of growth now coming over that period across the Company and really shared by all four of our business groups, that combined with the demonstrated operating leverage we think we've been able to bring to bear, really offers us some great earnings trajectory over that midterm planning horizon. Ron Epstein : One follow on, if I may. When you look back over what happened in the fourth quarter, did you see a pick up in pipeline activity, tire kicking, however you want to call it, post the election at Gulfstream? Jason Aiken : I have not heard anything anecdotal specific to that from the guys down at Gulfstream. As I said, the fourth quarter was very encouraging both from order and pipeline activity standpoint, but I certainly don't think I have enough color to attribute that either to post election or otherwise. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Cai von Rumohr : So in aerospace, you noted that the accounting change would have a negative impact on 2017 and yet looking at the numbers, it looks like there are 16 more green deliveries of large biz jets where you make your money, so that if those catch up you pick up 16, that's the math, in 2017 and if you are really going to get a G500 out the door and booked into revenue in 2017, by my math, it would look like this would actually have a positive impact, because there's 16 planes where the greens happen, the greens happened already, so you basically pick up the 80% on those 16 planes. So help us understand that, if you could. Jason Aiken : Sure, so the planes you refer to, as I mentioned, the 16 is a little bit of an overstatement because they were somewhere in the ballpark of a half dozen or more handful of these special mission airplanes that don't flow into completions so they are done and out. But again I think the key to remember is, what we're trying to do here in the moment and this I believe is last time we'll do this, because green deliveries, will just fade out of the discussion from this point forward. But when you're trying to think about in the moment, as we transition between the old rules and the new rules, some of the instinct might be, as you've articulated, that wow you get to recount the value associated with these green airplanes that didn't deliver outfitted at the end of 2016.  But you have to keep in mind, that was going to happen at the end of 2017 as well, so there's an output on the other end that's that natural flow of the business. And if you think of this as a steady in production model, the 650 to 550 to 450 to 280, you'd expect that similar cadence coming out the other end. So if you just leave it at that, it's essentially a net neutral or close to it anyway, where Kim articulated it as a modest headwind and when I say headwind, it's an accounting artifice headwind, it's not a business headwind. What's happening there is we would have had, if you imagine a G500 entry into service before the end of the year, there's quite naturally a handful of green G500s that are incremental to those in production aircraft, that are also going to tilt out of 2017 and into 2018, so on balance, we would see more of an outflow if you will or a tilt out of the year in 2017 on the back end, because of that phenomenon around the entry into service of the G500. Even then we're seeing as a tilt in flow from the end of 2016 into 2017. So hence our attempt to try to high pressure you understand in the moment, as we transition, what the impact of the shift of the new rules is on Gulfstream. Operator : The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Carter Copeland : Jason, I wondered if you could just clarify the adjustments in marine on the restatement were obviously quite large and the go-forward margin that you're implying for 2017 in the mid 8s is a bit different than we've seen in recent years. Was there something about a booking rate change or anything from the shift away from perspective there, that's a go-forward difference that we should be noting or is that just coincidental? Jason Aiken : I think really there's nothing, as I mentioned before. In the moment, when you look at individual quarterly performance and in this case try to examine the difference between how the results looked under the perspective method and the [indiscernible] catch up method it's really a function of what were the booking rate changes on those programs, in that portfolio, in the moment. So when you look at it, the third quarter was actually higher because we had on balance favorable booking rate changes in the fourth quarter across that portfolio, on balance had some negative booking rate changes.  Again under the prospective method, as you are well aware and we talked about many types that gets cast out over the future, so there's virtually nil effect in the moment when you make those changes. You can see in the results, it had more volatile effect under the cume catch up method. I don't think you can take that and translate or extend that into what does it mean for the margin rates or the business in 2017 and beyond. Those are pretty much disconnected, I think.  Really it's a function of, as you know, we've experienced some cost growth at the Bath shipyard on the settlement of the A12 program and some of the work we're doing on the DDG1000, as well as restart of the 51 program there. So that's well documented and discussed and we're working our way through that and we have every expectation we'll get that shipyard back to where we want it to be, as quickly as we can. So that's one influence and the other is of course, as we add more and more volume around the cost-plus Columbia class development effort, that of course is going to be dilutive in terms of margins, with respect to how it compares to fixed price full rate production programs, so that's really more what you're seeing going forward. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. David Strauss : Jason, with regard to the long term forecast for the defense businesses, obviously, you guys have had to make some assumption around the budget over the next couple of years. Can you talk about what you assume there, if it's just sequestration or not? And then on aerospace, it might be helpful just to kind of calibrate us, if you could talk about over that planning period what the ranges of completed deliveries, I guess more importantly, large cabin completed deliveries? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Sure, so look as it relates to the Defense budget, I don't know that there's anything more fundamental assumed than what we're seeing which is notionally upward directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across-the-board. Really what it's about more so is what's in the backlog. We've developed a historically high backlog across the Company and now we're all about executing that backlog.  So a good share of what you see, particularly in combat systems and in marine systems is all about just executing on that backlog and continuing to perform the way we have. So that gives us a great deal of confidence about that trajectory that I described.  As it relates to aerospace, so I alluded to before, if I had to guess and I don't want to commit Phebe but I'm fairly certain, this will probably be the last time we talk about green deliveries, because it's all about outfitted deliveries in the future. So to your point right now as we look at 2017, we're projecting somewhere in the range from a large cabin perspective of call it 90 to 95 outfitted deliveries and from a mid-cabin perspective, somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 deliveries. As you are well aware, we tend not to look out beyond one year because we set production rates and work through those customer contracts on an annual basis, so we'll continue to update that on an annual basis, but that gives you a sense of what we're seeing as we head into 2017. Operator : The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Howard Rubel : On your backlog, it's down a little bit sequentially and I know some of that's attributable to timing. Could you do two things for us, Jason? One, provide us with a little bit of an indication of the pipeline for combat systems? We know there's a lot of things in the FMS pipeline. And then second, how do you see, you talked a little bit about Gulfstream, but where are some of the open slots for opportunities for sales? Jason Aiken : Sure. So you mentioned the backlog is down just slightly sequentially and something important to point out there, particularly as it relates to combat systems. Kim alluded to the foreign exchange impact in that group, as it relates to our annual sales. You have to keep in mind there's equally, if not more so, an impact on what you will, the balance sheet for sales, that is the backlog. And so we saw something on the order of magnitude of a $700 million reduction in combat systems backlog in 2016, as a result of that FX headwind. So that gives you a sense of what's happening there. In terms of opportunities in the pipeline, you're right. It is quite robust, both on the domestic and the international front. We've got a number of competitions. There's an 8x8 vehicle in the UK, there's opportunities in Poland and the Czech Republic, follow-on work in Austria. Really the list goes on and on throughout both Europe and the Middle East for combat systems, as it relates to international programs. Domestically, we're looking forward to the ramp up with recapitalization efforts and so on, as it relates to Stryker ECP, Stryker Lethality, with the 30-millimeter gun, Abrams upgrades, Marine Corps Labs, really it's just a very encouraging and robust list for this group, again both domestically and across-the-board internationally. So really exciting to see.  Your last part of your question, aerospace slots, I think fundamentally the thing, the way to think about this is, with the good order activity we saw in the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by our EIS next available slots for the various aircraft. The 650 remains essentially consistent with where we were last time, 24 months or so. The 550 remains in the 12 month range, 450, we actually only had one aircraft left to sell so we should get that behind us this quarter which by the way I think is a great testament to this transition and the way Gulfstream has handled this. When you think about it from both sides of the spectrum, on the one end there was the speculation about could we get the 500 into service when we said we could and doing what we said it would? And certainly, the test program it's demonstrating so far that it's meeting if not exceeding all of our expectations for what the airplane can do and Phebe mentioned a quarter ago, we've now officially pulled that EIS in from first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017.  So that's on one end of the spectrum, but this point about one 450 left, possibly the more difficult aspect of this transition was managing the supply chain, the order activity, the inventories and so on to close that out in a timely and secure fashion, without exposing the Company and manage this transition and so far so good. So that is really encouraging, so that's what we see on the horizon from an EIS perspective for the various aircraft. Erin Linnihan : Great. Thank you for joining our call today.

Spingarn - Credit Suisse David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alison Harbrecht, Staff VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Alison, and good morning. Alison has replaced Erin Linnihan, who is now reporting to me in a different capacity. Alison has had a distinguished 14-year career in the finance department, most recently as the Controller for Mission Systems. We are pleased to have her here as our Staff VP for Investor Relations. As to the quarter commentary, I will keep my remarks brief since this quarter's results are relatively straightforward, quite good, and the comparisons are generally attractive. We reported earnings per share of $2.48 on revenue somewhat in excess of $7.4 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and net earnings of $763 million. EPS of $2.48 was $0.16 better than consensus. We estimate that about $0.06 of that $0.16 was from operations in the form of higher than expected operating margins, offset modestly by somewhat lower than expected revenue. The remainder came from a lower effective tax rate, offset slightly by a somewhat higher than anticipated share count. With respect to cash, we had $533 million net cash provided by operating activities. After capital expenditure of $62 million, we had $471 million of free cash flow from operations, $56 million more than in the year-ago quarter. While our total backlog at $60.4 billion is down $1.8 billion from year-end figures, it remains quite robust. It is also significant to observe that the important funded portion of that backlog grew by approximately $1.5 billion to $53.3 billion. An impressive 88.2% of our total backlog is funded. The general comparisons quarter over quarter reflect, as you would expect, strong operating performance. All of the comparisons I will give you are with reference to 2016 numbers as restated for the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules for this year. So, compared to the first quarter of 2016, revenue was down $35 million, or 0.5%. However, our operating earnings were up $111 million or 12% over the prior year's quarter on the strength of a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin in the quarter at 13.9% was particularly strong. On a sequential basis, revenue was down $213 million or 2.8%. But again, operating earnings were up $267 million or 34.8% on a 390 basis point improvement in margin. All of the foregoing is a reflection of very positive operating leverage. Finally, EPS from continuing operations was up $0.40, up 19.2% over the year-ago quarter as a result a better operating earnings and a lower tax rate and share count. Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results in each of our operating segments, first Aerospace. Revenue was up by $293 million compared to Q1 2016, about 16.5%, and up $249 million or 13.6% sequentially. Similarly, operating earnings were up $111 million or 33.4% against the year-ago quarter on a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin. Sequentially, operating earnings were up $169 million on a 640 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential result needs to be understood in the context of the restated 2016 revenue and earnings resulting from the new revenue recognition rules. In the fourth quarter, we had nine more green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness than we had final deliveries to customers. This negatively impacted Q4 2016 as restated because the green deliveries were no longer recognized. By the same token, we had four more entry-into-service deliveries in Q1 2017 than we had green aircraft receive a certificate of airworthiness. That obviously helped the first quarter of 2017 and should help next quarter as well. Orders for the group were typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, net earnings were $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.7. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2012 through 2016. The Aerospace average booking for the first quarter over the last five years were $1.39 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a quarter with a lot of sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a strong fourth quarter. In particular, we noted sharp increases in activity levels in Europe and improved activity in China. I should also note that the activity has been good in April and has clearly shifted in favor of large-cabin. This is quite encouraging. On the product development front, we anticipate a late-October completion of all flight test requirements for the G500. This leads us to believe that FAA certification will follow within 60 days thereafter. By the way, we are going to fly our third G600 test airplane today. Think about it this way : We are flying three test airplanes in the first 4.5 months since first flight, really quite remarkable. So we are off to a very good start in the Aerospace group, somewhat better than our guidance to you at the operating earnings level. We expected a strong first quarter for the reasons we discussed with you at the beginning of the year. However, the operating performance was better than expected. Let me turn to the defense side of the business with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up $42 million or 3.4%, and operating earnings were up $18 million or 9.6% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. We had particularly strong performance on a quarter to year-ago quarter basis from European Land Systems. Sequentially, revenue was down $374 million, but operating earnings were down only $25 million on a 210 basis point improvement in operating margin. The sequential comparison is particularly difficult on a revenue basis because this group always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at OTS and ELS. Also in the quarter, we largely completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on our two large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mideast, and the U.K. These programs will now enter full production and continue apace for the next several years. Even given Combat's large backlog, they had nice order activity in the quarter, with a 0.7 times book-to-bill. All in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. With respect to Information Systems and Technology, we experienced very good operating leverage in the quarter. While revenue was down $182 million or 7.8% against the year-ago quarter and down $125 million sequentially, operating earnings of $236 million were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million, once again on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. These results are consistent with our guidance of an around 11% operating margin. I think it's important to note that IS&T's backlog grew by $255 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times following strong book-to-bill of 1-to-1 on average for the last four years. The significant orders in the quarter included a $415 million contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to design and develop its next-generation communication and information system; $85 million from the NATO Communication and Information Agency to upgrade its technical infrastructure; and $160 million from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency for the new Campus East. So a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective at IS&T. Finally, let's turn to Marine. Revenue of $1.93 billion was down $188 million or 8.9% compared to the year-ago quarter, but up $37 million or 2% sequentially. Operating earnings were down $23 million or 12.5% against the year-ago quarter and up $119 million sequentially. The revenue variance from the year-ago quarter was solely attributable to lower Virginia-class Block 3 material volume, offset only partially by higher Columbia-class engineering volume and higher repair volume. Earnings were driven by a delay in the scheduled delivery on one ship in Block 3 of our Virginia-class submarine program. Our performance on the Virginia-class program continues to be solid. Also at EB, we are already over 40% complete on the design of the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, four years before start of construction. This performance is far better than any submarine first-of-class design maturity to construction start date in history, so we are pleased. Bath's ship-over-ship performance on the remainder of the DDG 1000s is outstanding, and we have stabilized the DDG 51. NASSCO continues to show performance improvement on each of its ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. We do not as a practice change guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will continue to consolidate our improvements and strive to continue to improve our results. I'd like to turn the call over now to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $25 million versus $22 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. On the capital deployment front, we spent $354 million on the repurchase of 1.9 million shares in the first quarter. When you combine our share repurchases with our dividend payments, we spent $584 million in shareholder-friendly actions during the first quarter, almost 125% of our free cash flow from operations. We continue to anticipate deploying all of our free cash flow this year to share repurchases and dividends. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $1.7 billion. As Phebe mentioned, our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter. The lower first quarter rate was anticipated based on the timing of the vesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefits and is consistent with our full-year tax rate forecast. So despite coming out of the gate with a lower rate, we're still anticipating an effective tax rate of about 28% for the year. Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Gary, can you please remind the participants how to enter the queue? Operator : The first question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So, Phebe, as you said, good performance across the board. In Marine, you've got a lot going on. I wanted to ask you about that. It's a multipart question, but it really gets to CapEx over the next several years with the Columbia class coming in, a construction contract rumored to be around $5 billion. You have the advanced procurement money that went into the December CR that's nearly I guess $0.75 billion. And then we've got this very ambitious 355-ship force structure assessment, where large surface combatants go up from something like 88 to 104, attack submarines go up from 48 to 66, going from two per year perhaps to three, same with the destroyers. Given that, how do we think about the requirement for you \u2013 for GD to invest in CapEx over the next several years? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me give you our investment philosophy across the board. We invest in programs that we believe we can earn a sufficient and proper return. So to the extent that those returns become increasingly clear, that then informs our investment, and that's true across the entirety of our portfolio. So I think you need to think about our investment proposition through that lens. With respect to the increase in shipbuilding, to the extent that that materializes and we can understand both the quantum and the timing of those increases, we have the capacity to increase production in each of our shipyards, as does the majority of our supply base. But with all of these \u2013 with any increase in production, we would need to replenish as needed our workforce, the supplier base, and facilities over time. And again, all of the potential investments with respect to that growth will be determined with our customer as we begin to identify the return. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : So, Phebe, would we go through a period where there is some pressure on cash flow from the added CapEx and maybe pressure on margins as you hire and prepare for future higher revenue? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our current plan anticipates an investment in our shipbuilding program commensurate with what we see the growth to be. So we may see in the out years some cash demands as a result of those investments, but I believe it will be well within our capabilities. And remember too, the cash that's tied up at Gulfstream will begin to unwind naturally as well. So we will consider all of those puts and takes as we think about our investment into the future. You had a second part of that. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse : I was simply talking about the possible impact to margins as you start to hire and so forth, yes. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have done a very careful plan on what our margin expectations are. And we see our margins throughout at least our initial plan period of four years as essentially flat in the mid-8% range. And that's because the increase in Columbia volume will continue to be cost-plus, and then offset somewhat by the Virginia-class submarine performance and that long-term successful program as we have continued improvement ship over ship. So think about flat in the near term. As we go out into the future, then it's our job to manage that growth appropriately. And as you can imagine, with all \u2013 when you think about shipbuilding, it's all about planning. That's really the competitive advantage and the key to success in shipbuilding. So we have put in place very, very detailed hiring plans, training plans, supplier base plans, and facility plans to support that growth. So as we sit here today, I'm very comfortable that we are both anticipating and thinking through the potential risks of growth. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Jason, maybe could you touch on the EAC's cume adjustments in the quarter on a year-over-year basis given the new reporting structure? And then, Phebe, I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems and specifically the U.S. business. How prepared are you or your production lines, Stryker or Abrams, for a potential ramp-up there? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So as it relates to the EAC adjustments, as you're probably alluding to, we had been expecting with this transition to the new revenue recognition rules and specifically the cumulative catch-up approach to our defense businesses to start to see a little more volatility, perhaps a little bit more in terms of magnitude on this side. As it turns out for the first quarter, in any event, the aggregate number was actually about $50 million and not too different from what we saw a year ago on a restated basis. I think that was $58 million. So still TBD in terms of what we'll see quarter to quarter over time still. We're probably expecting some level of volatility, but for now it was a relatively inconsequential quarter. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So with respect to Combat Systems, there has been quite a lot of discussion in this new administration about potential increases to the land forces in the United States. And to the extent again to which those increases actually occur and the timing and the amounts of those increases, we will look at that as the details emerge. But we have plenty of capacity and plenty of operating leverage both within Combat Systems and within our supply base. So I have very little doubt that we can ramp up to meet any expectations that our customers, both the Army and the Marine Corps, may have in the future. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Jason, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: At the risk, Jason, of asking again the nerdy accounting question on the EACs, just since you guys have never really had this before, is that $58 million \u2013 or that $50 million, is that a net favorable/unfavorable number? And if so, can you give us the pieces? And then one for Phebe. I just wondered. You made a statement about stabilizing the DDG 51 at Bath. I just wondered if there was something beneath that, what metric you're looking at in terms of stabilization that gave you the confidence to make that statement. Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So good question. I didn't clarify that earlier. Both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter were net favorable adjustments. And in parsing that, there was no material up or downs in there on any segment or any program. So there were some positives and negatives, as you'd expect, but nothing material. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let's talk a minute, and this might be a good opportunity to give you a little bit of color on Bath. And let me break that into two buckets, first the DDG 1000, and then to your specific question on the DDG 51. So we delivered the lead ship of the DDG 1000 last May, and the final two ships of this class are demonstrating very good levels of ship-over-ship learning in terms of labor-hour performance, which is our prime metric that we look at when we look at shipbuilding. And in fact, we experienced the best ship-to-ship learning curve we have ever seen at Bath on that program. So to the extent that there was any risk, I believe that is behind us. With respect to the DDG 51, just to give you a little bit of background, we delivered the DDG 115, which was our first ship after the four-plus year break in production. We delivered that in February. We just floated off the DDG 116. But let me give you a little color here. That four-year break caused us a bit of a challenge, which the DDG 1000 program exacerbated. And I think by way of illustration a recent example can give you a sense of how we've managed through all of this. Before the DDG 1002, we had late equipment deliveries into the shipyard that required us to rephase our production, and it created a production gap between the DDG 116 and the DDG 118. We'll see some learning from ship to ship as we realize steady-state production on this, but the costs associated with those challenges were recognized in 2016. So going forward, I'm very comfortable that the performance at Bath has stabilized. I like where they are. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Phebe. Operator : The next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, just maybe shifting back towards Gulfstream but maybe from a different angle. If Northrup were to win the JSTARS program, how do you think about the impact that could have on Gulfstream across the business, and specifically for the G550? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, it is our practice to refer any questions about JSTARS to the prime, Northrup. But with respect to the G550, let me take some license with a quote that Mark Twain said, that the reports of his demise were greatly exaggerated. We have sufficient orders, both on the commercial side and international orders, for the G550 to keep that production line open for the foreseeable future. So JSTARS would be additive to that if in fact the Northrup team prevails. So I very much like where we are on the G550. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just maybe as a follow-on to that, broadly speaking, can you maybe characterize more what's going on in the wide-cabin market? Are you seeing any customer hesitation around tax reform, accelerated depreciation, that kind of thing, or are you seeing follow-through with the pickup in the market that seemed to really happen post-election? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So in the first quarter, our activity was pretty much as we've seen for the prior years, but we have definitely seen frankly for about the last solid year now increased interest in our aircraft. And the extent to which we execute on that interest and put all those planes into backlog, that's simply a question of timing. But we're seeing some very nice demand for our products as we have for the last few years, but I do see an uptick. So whatever set of reasons, different customers are motivated by a different economic reality. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I was interested in looking at, now that you're getting close to the G500 coming into service, when you look at the ramp for that program, how would you compare that to what happened on the G650? Are you looking at a similar production increase over the next few years to the G650 ramp? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, if you recall, the G650 was the first aircraft that we had a purpose-built manufacturing facility to outfit and bring in assembly and then outfit the airplanes. We experienced and had quite a bit of learning around that \u2013 around how we performed during that period. So when I think about the ramp up on the G500, we've taken yet another purpose-built facility, applied the lessons learned on the G650, and I expect and our plan anticipates that we'll have a very nice ramp up both in terms of volume and performance relative to the G650. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And I know there obviously were some problems on the ramp in the G650. But if you look at the size of the program say, and if things go smoothly and say they go smoothly for the G650, is this one that would look at a similar kind of a rate increase over time to the G650? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I think we'd see a little bit in terms of timing and amount a little bit faster, but step back and think about the G500 and the G600. When we entered into the test program, we had retired an enormous amount of risk even before we had our first flight. And at every step of the way on both the G500 and now the G600, we have met or surpassed our milestones and the capabilities that we had designed into that airplane. So the design maturity of even the test airplane is far in excess of what we saw on the G650. So the disequilibrium that I think I talked about back in 2013 where we had a bunch of G650s on the tarmac that we had to go back in and retrofit, we do not anticipate anything like that for the G500 and G600, simply because the test airplanes were really manufactured to production standards. So we'll all go back, and as we have had changes and updates in some design parameters, we've done those at that time. So I don't anticipate \u2013 in fact, there's nothing to indicate that we would see anything like we did on the G650. Does that answer your question? Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. And if I can, on the purpose-built facility, because a lot of what happened on the G650 is you made some pretty dramatic improvements in manufacturing processes. I know you've done a lot of work in that regard on the G500 and G600. Would you characterize the potential to improve cost of manufacturing on the G500 and G600 as a step comparable to what you did from the G550 and the G650, and should we see an improvement like that? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Given that we will start out at a higher rate, perhaps the incremental improvement plane over plane may be less than what we saw on the G650, but I think that we are poised to have a very nice learning curve plane over plane in both programs. And that's how we have \u2013 all of the analysis that we have done in terms of production preplanning suggests that will be the case. Operator : The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. I will just use the cash flow statement to ask about four questions. No, to be serious for a moment, thank you, Phebe. But to be serious, there are two points. One, to go back to Doug's question a little bit, we didn't see a lot of increase in inventory. And so if we're preparing for reasonable growth in or entry into service of the G500, can you explain the puts and the takes there? And then second, I thought at some point we would get some further advances from some of your international Combat Systems business. And when might we expect that? Are there some milestones related to that? And then just one small follow-up item, could you talk about FirstNet for a moment? Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Howard, I'll take your first part of your question on the inventories. This is one of the other many underlying subtleties of the new revenue recognition rule that we maybe skipped over at the year-end conference call as we touched on the major muscle movers. But in this case, we used to have a fairly \u2013 in the balance sheet categorization \u2013 I'll try and be as quick as I can on this. Of these accounts, we used to have what we called contracts in process that was almost exclusively related to the defense business, and inventory that you could pretty \u2013 as a general statement, pretty closely correlate to the Aerospace business. The new rules have us categorizing these two accounts as what we called unbilled receivables and inventories now, and it now co-mingles some of the different pieces of the defense and commercial Aerospace businesses. So there were some decreases in inventories associated with the defense businesses in the quarter offsetting some of the increase that we've talked about in the Gulfstream business as we built up on the G500 and G600 programs, so there's a little bit of netting going on in there that you're seeing. But still, the story on the aerospace inventory build and the working capital is consistent with the production ramp we've talked about. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So turning to our international Combat Systems vehicle orders, we have, up until this point, had milestone payments, but we move in this quarter, in the second quarter, into payment on delivery. So we anticipate that we will have a more regular order of cash on the unit of deliveries. And again, we are ahead of plan on our production. So I'm comfortable that the cash flow that we modeled at the beginning of these programs we will execute on appropriately. FirstNet, we have been careful to refer the general questions to AT&T, to whom we are a sub. But we consider this a potential growth market into the future and for many years to come. And again, it will be a nice franchise for us. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Samuel Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could talk about two different segments in terms of the guidance. Just IS&T, why the revenue looked so weak this quarter, and can you still get that back to up modestly for the year? And I guess if you can address Aerospace, the same thing with the margin, where it is this year would seem as though your low 19% is a pretty low hurdle. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me address in the inverse order. We had a particularly outstanding quarter. I think that was obvious. We anticipate that we'll be at about a 20% margin in the second and third quarter and then a decline in the fourth quarter. So as of today, we're still holding to our guidance. With respect to the IS&T revenue, let me talk about two things here. Remember, these are two \u2013 the two businesses in that group are short-cycle businesses, so we had anticipated a lighter volume quarter. It was a touch lighter than we had anticipated, largely because as we changed administrations, we had some slowdown in the execution of the contract line items in a number of particular programs. So our view today is that we are very much poised to recover that, and we're holding to our guidance. Let me talk to you a little bit about though \u2013 and I think this might be an opportune time \u2013 talk to you a little bit about how we built the guidance for this year and equally importantly in the out years. When we built our plans in the fall, we considered only those then-known programs. We factored them accordingly and then built into our plans the attendant cash flow. To the extent across the defense portfolio that we see additional funding, that represents upside to us. That's true in Combat, in the Marine group, and particularly in IS&T. So I think understanding the context in which we built these plans will help you get some sense of our confidence in our revenue estimates for the year as we stand today. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So, Phebe, as I thought I heard you talk about Gulfstream 500 certification flights into October and then certification two months later, are we talking about certification late in the year? And is that consistent with still hitting some initial deliveries in the fourth quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: This has been \u2013 there's nothing that has changed in our plan with respect to certification from the FAA. And I think our plan anticipated, and we're on track to do that, one delivery. We'll have multiple green airplanes, but just right now we're looking at one completed entry into service airplane on the G500, again consistent with what we have been anticipating. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then based on what you said about the margins at Gulfstream, I think on the fourth quarter call you talked about the quarterly earnings pattern, given where you started the year. Could you maybe update us because if the margins are going to go down in the fourth quarter, on paper that would seem to be a tougher compare? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: One thing I think we talked about in January on the call was with \u2013 and I think we talked about it in light of the transition to the new revenue recognition rules, how we were anticipating having a stronger first quarter, and Phebe went into this in her remarks about the green deliveries, the extra green deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year and how those would translate into more outfitted deliveries in the first quarter. But as we then went out of the year, we had been anticipating green production, as she just discussed, of the G500s, which would now be deferred till they're outfitted deliveries into 2018. So while the year guidance is what it is, the slope is a little bit different than perhaps typical with the stronger first quarter and a little bit of that shift in the fourth quarter because of that transition to the G500. So I can't reverse-engineer it for you here specifically, but I think that slope is what we alluded to at the end of the year and consistent with Phebe just described earlier. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Phebe, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes back on Aerospace and talk a little bit about services aftermarkets at aviation. Just maybe describe a little bit about the current demand environment, particularly on the completion side of things for Jet, what you're seeing in cycles, and the aftermarket for the existing Gulfstream fleet. And then talk a little bit about the longer-term outlook for your businesses there, some of the recent M&A activity we've seen there, and some of the other investments that you're making, and what your view is on the longer-term growth outlook for Aerospace Services? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our Aerospace Services business did very well in the quarter, both in terms of volume and particularly at Gulfstream in terms of volume and margin. And the service business is somewhat cyclical, but we have continued to improve our operating performance on our service end at Gulfstream. With respect to Jet, we've got a nice pipeline of opportunities in the quarter. They're a bit of a drag on a book-to-bill basis in the quarter, but we expect a strong second quarter on the completions side in terms of demand. And the demand at Jet Aviation has been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. It's somewhat lumpy, so as we \u2013 the additions into backlog of new orders have been a touch lumpy on the completions side. On the services side, we've been making a series of very targeted small investments to augment our FBO capability and our managed fleet capability. One of the things I'm particularly pleased about is that we've seen additional synergies between Gulfstream and Jet Aviation as we have matured Jet and begun to provide them additional resources and assets to support Gulfstream worldwide, and we're continuing that path. So completions business steady, lumpy in terms of order activity. But on the service side, we see nice growth in the future, and we're very pleased with the performance of the investments we've made heretofore. Operator : The next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was wondering if I could circle onto Gulfstream just for a second. The fourth quarter margin of 19%, is that more indicative of the completions that were carried over being better margin than the first half of 2017 and the flow-in of initial deliveries of the G500? And what does that tell us about 2018? You've talked about the top line growth in 2018, but I don't think you've said if the EBIT grows in 2018. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So, as it relates to the fourth quarter, I don't know if you can state it that simply. As always, the quarter-to-quarter margin in the Aerospace business is going to be the result of a number of factors. We've touched on them from time to time over the years. Obviously mix is an important part of that. You alluded to that, so there's a piece of that there. But it's also the level of pre-owned activity, the service business, Jet Aviation, R&D. All of those have meaningful points that can move you 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points in a given quarter on each of those particular items. So I wouldn't chalk it up to any one influence, but that's what the mix is shaking out to be as we're looking at the fourth quarter. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So when you think about margins and earnings too, but let's talk about \u2013 let's go back a couple years ago when we \u2013 as we entered into this transition from the G455 and G50 to the G500 and G600, we told you all that our goal was essentially flat earnings. And we were going to accomplish that by feathering in some additional G650. We've done that, but on top of which we've had superior cost control and nice operating leverage at Gulfstream. So that's combined to allow us to meet that commitment. As we go into next year, we are anticipating \u2013 we haven't given you specific year-over-year guidance on margins, but we're going to bring down that G650 production a touch, as you would expect as we move up the ramp on the G500 and then ultimately the G600. So when you look at \u2013 the past has to be prologue. When you look at the operating performance of Gulfstream, I am very comfortable that they'll do nicely on their margin performance. But we're not going to get into 2018 details until we get a little bit further. In fact, we'll do it at the end of the year, as is our constant practice. Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, all right. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Thanks so much, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on this whole continuing resolution situation, whether you've seen any impact of that, particularly on your short-cycle businesses, and what your expectations are if this should drag on. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: The Congress \u2013 the customer has made it quite clear to the Congress on the impacts on national security of failing to enact a budget. That said, we've done an analysis of a potential full-year CR, which we do not anticipate. But if we actually experience a full-year CR, the impact on our 2017 is not material. So that tells you something about the strength of our backlog, by the way. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So there's been no impact in IS&T that you've seen so far? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, not yet, other than it's a little slow to execute on some of the contract task orders, but we anticipate that increasing. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's great, thank you very much. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Gary, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : And the final question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Phebe, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the M&A landscape these days and whether anticipation of a growing defense budget causes you to look at anything differently or whether high valuations remain a deterrent. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So I have an answer that I've been giving for the last four years now under the fifth, and it's we're not going to comment on M&A. It's simply not appropriate. You all understand the landscape, and we haven't seen much changes in valuations, so no real change. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, fair enough. And maybe I'll sneak in another quick one then. And maybe as you talk about \u2013 thinking about the business jet market and where you think about the opportunities longer term, I guess, as you think about investing in new platforms, not necessarily a specific plan, but whether you'd think about smaller or large, and also your future plans for the G280. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Let's answer this in this regard because any more specificity is inappropriate. You can expect that we will continue to have a robust R&D profile to fund new product development now and into the future. That's our business proposition. And in that regard, we're going to stick to our knitting. We're going to stick to our market in which we have excelled, and frankly we're the only company to fully excel. So steady as she goes, past is prologue. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you very much. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Great, thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a good day. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alison Harbrecht, Staff Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a solid second quarter, with revenue of $7.68 billion and net earnings of $749 million. We reported EPS of $2.45 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.02 per share better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that the sell side anticipated somewhat more revenue, but lower margins and a somewhat higher tax rate. Operating earnings were about as forecast by the sell side. All in all, pretty close. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue of $7.68 billion was $99 million or 1.3% lower. However, net earnings of $749 million were up $35 million or 4.9%, on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margins and 160 basis point lower effective tax rate. This led to EPS that was 6.5% better than the year ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue was up $234 million or 3.1% and operating earnings were up $21 million or 2%, on a 10 basis point lower operating margin, still very respectable 13.8%. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. Revenue was down $134 million, less than 1% against the first half of 2016. On the other hand, operating earnings were up $140 million or 7.2% on lower cost. Operating margins were 100 basis points better. Earnings from continuing operations were up $144 million or 10.5%. EPS was $0.55 better. In short, we had a very good first half, somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations, and well ahead of last year. This leads quite naturally to the guidance increase reflected in the press release. I'll provide additional color on that guidance in a minute. But first, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and wrap that into our EPS guidance. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $2.08 billion was $206 million lower than the year ago quarter. However, operating earnings of $425 million or $1 million more, on 190 basis point improvement in operating margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $4 million and operating earnings were down $18 million, on a 90 basis point reduction in margin, but remaining in excess of 20%. For the first half, revenue at $4.15 billion is up $87 million against last year. Importantly, operating earnings at $868 million are up $112 million or 14.8%, on a 230 basis point improvement in margin. In short, at $868 million in operating earnings for the first half of the year, Aerospace is well positioned to achieve its earning goals for the year. By the way, recall we previously told you that the new revenue recognition rule which helped us in the first two quarters of the year would have a negative impact in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So expect lower operating margins in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. You'll see this reflected in our guidance. Let me give you some commentary about order activity in the quarter and then some observations about the current state of the market, insofar as it impacts Gulfstream. First, in the quarter, the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.9 to 1, which is very good. The mix is particularly advantageous, with over 80% of the orders for large-cabin aircraft. The G500 and G600 continued to build backlog in advance of their entry into service, sufficient to ensure the success of these programs, interestingly, the G550 built backlog as well in the quarter. While we read the reports of weak demand and reduced deliveries across the industry, our experience is reasonable and steady demand for our products. We will deliver as many airplanes this year as we did last on an entry-into-service basis. Commentators frequently speak of weakness in the large-cabin market. Let me say that it is misleading to speak of a highly differentiated marketplace as if it were one market. Parts of the market are very active, particularly those market segments where there is new product. There are also market segments that are slow, largely because of the absence of product introduction. So we believe that the market is not only differentiated by segment, but also by the innovative offerings within this segment. We believe this is why demand for our products remain fairly consistent. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early contract activity and contract discussion. The interest in the G650 and G650ER as well as the G550 remains quite good and supportive of next year's operating plan. In short, we expect a good third quarter and a second half from an orders perspective. Now, let me say a few words about our progress towards certification of the G500 and G600. The G500 and G600 flying continues to go well. The aircraft are performing reliably and on schedule. The G500 testing includes four test aircraft and one production aircraft with a full interior. The four test aircraft have entered the Type Inspection Authorization or TIA flying phase. This phase is for actual certification credit. FAA pilots have joined Gulfstream flight crews on these TIA tests. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to ensure optimal safety and efficient use of resources. We expect to complete certification flying in Q4 2017. Additionally, we continue to work closely with our suppliers to complete all component level testing this year. Once we have completed certification, the interior test aircraft, P1, will enter service as our G500 demonstrator. It is important to note, however, that the G500 will not have any impact to revenue and earnings this year. That is the result of the new revenue recognition rule. The G600 now has four test aircraft flying and the interior is being installed in the first production aircraft. We remain on schedule to certify in 2018. Let's now turn to the defense side of the house. First, Combat Systems. Combat had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.41 billion was $117 million more than the second quarter last year, up 9%. Similarly, operating earnings were $225 million, up $20 million, almost 10% better than second quarter 2016. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $127 million or almost 10%, and operating earnings were up $20 million, again, almost 10% better. For the first half, revenue was up $159 million or 6.3% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were up $38 million, 9.7% on a 50 basis point margin expansion. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well across our platforms, ordnance and ammunition portfolios. We continue to move nicely from engineering to production on our two large international orders. We also continue to win programs particularly out of our European Land Systems business. We are obviously trending in the right direction at Combat Systems. With respect to the Marine group, revenue of $2.08 billion was $101 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $6 million against the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $145 million and operating earnings were up $17 million on the higher revenue and a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, revenue of $4.01 billion was down $87 million or 2.1% against the first half of 2016. Operating earnings were also lower by $17 million on a 30 basis points contraction in margin. Work on our submarine programs, that is production on Blocks 3 and 4 for the Virginia-class and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine replacement, continue to perform nicely. With respect to our Bath shipyard, the challenges on the DDG 1000 and 51 restart ships are largely behind us, and our auxiliary ship and commercial businesses continued smoothly. In addition, we have seen an uptick in demand for repair across our repair yards, primarily in San Diego and Washington State. Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so. Our operating margin should continue to improve over time. Turning to IS&T, the group continues to perform well on the bottom line, despite some revenue headwind. Revenue of $2.1 billion was down $111 million against the year ago quarter. On the other hand, operating earnings of $240 million were up against the year ago quarter by $6 million. There was an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, which was particularly impressive. Sequentially, revenue was lower by $42 million or 2%, but operating earnings were up $4 million on a 40 basis point improvement in margin. This quarter's 11.4% operating margin is exceptional in my view. The story for the first half is much the same. Revenue was down $293 million or 6.4%, but operating earnings were up $5 million on an 80 basis point improvement in margins. So once again, very strong operating leverage. For both our IT services and tactical communication and Intel business, our cost performance and market positioning have driven very nice win rates. Not surprisingly, our IS&T backlog grew $175 million in the quarter, with a book-to-bill of greater than 1 to 1 once again. In short, we believe the segment results leave us positioned to do well in the second half. Before I move on, let me give you a sense of the defense environment, at least from my perspective. There is clear intent in the administration and in parts of the Congress for increased defense spending. We believe this intent will manifest in some level of increased defense spending in the procurement and R&D accounts. The question is how much and when? Relevant considerations include : the dispatch with which Congress approves a higher defense budget and how soon the administration can propose and the Congress can approve the department's senior leadership appointment. Without these appointments, it is difficult to process contracts and get authorized and appropriated funds obligated to contracts. At this juncture, both are proceeding more slowly than we thought would happen. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the direction of defense spending. So turning to guidance, let me provide some guidance for the year for each segment, compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it up into our EPS outlook. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion, up 6.4% from 2016; operating earnings of approximately $1.6 billion, with an operating margin rate of 19.1% to 19.2%. We now expect to be approximately $8.1 billion of revenue, with margins of 19.5% to 19.6%. This implies pressure on margins in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This will result in no change to the operating earnings forecast, still a very strong industry-leading performance. For Combat, our previous guidance was to expect revenue to be up 6.6% to 6.7% over 2016, with operating earnings of $920 million to $925 million. We now expect revenue of somewhat over $5.9 billion, just slightly above the 7% growth over last year, and operating earnings of $925 million to $930 million. So pretty close to the original guidance, with a slight upward bias. For the Marine group, we've previously guided to revenue of $7.9 billion, margins at around 8.6% and operating earnings of $680 million to $685 million. We now expect revenue to be up another $160 million to $165 million, with margins consistent with the previous forecast, resulting in a modest improvement in operating earnings. For IS&T, we guided to revenue up modestly over 2016, operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast is essentially flat and that operating earnings will be somewhat better at about 11.2% to 11.4%. So all of this rolls up into revenue for General Dynamics of about $31 billion and operating margins of 13.3% to 13.5% \u2013 13.4% to 13.5%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have somewhat lower revenue, operating earnings at the higher end of the forecasted range, a somewhat lower tax rate and a lower share count, which permits us to increase our EPS guidance to $9.70 to $9.75. To help you further, our EPS guidance was $9.50 to $9.55. The $0.20 difference is $0.05 from operations, $0.05 to $0.06 from a lower tax rate and about $0.09 to $0.10 from share purchases. The EPS progression for the remainder of the year is down slightly in Q3 versus Q2, with Q4 looking similar to this quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $23 million in the second quarter of 2016. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $49 million versus $45 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $105 million. Our effective tax rate was 27.4% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date. As Phebe mentioned, we're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of 27.5%. That reflects a greater benefit associated with employee stock option exercises than originally anticipated. On the capital deployment front, in the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares, bringing us to 4.6 million shares in the first half of the year for $900 million. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid, through the first six months of 2017, we've spent $1.4 billion in shareholder-friendly capital deployment, more than 1.5 times our $857 million of free cash flow for the first half. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $2.1 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approximate 100% of net earnings and, in turn, deploying 100% of that free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends. Alison, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Amy, can you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Certainly. The first question comes from Ronald Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Maybe just a big picture question for you, Phebe, in terms of the Land Systems business. We've seen a lot more press lately on the Russian T-14 Armata tank. When you look at the Land Systems business and you kind of look into the tea leaves, is there an opportunity there for you guys in terms of some sort of equipment response from the U.S. in terms of either yet another upgrade to the Abrams or something new, if you can add any color there. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. So the U.S. Army is anticipating upgrading the Abrams to the next version, in part to meet the changing and evolving threat, frankly, worldwide. So we have factored a lot of that into our thinking. And if you think about it, we went from one tank production a month for several years, just keeping that plant on my support and we're now looking at nice, nice improvement and throughput for that plant. So we see demand increasing for the Abrams in various configurations, both domestically and outside the U.S. as well. So the Abrams is, I think, positioned quite well to do \u2013 to continue to grow. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Samuel Pearlstein, Wells Fargo. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, IS&T has been running down for the first half of the year, if I just look last year, it's little bit of a tough comparison, you're still expecting to get to flat. I mean, how do you get there? What do you need to win or what's happening with IS&T in terms of being able to get to growth in the second half of the year? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let's talk about that in two respects. First, both of these businesses are shorter-cycle businesses and they're more affected by an extended CR. Recall, we had a seven-month extended CR, which had a impact on our products business and the execution of obligated funds, execution of appropriated funds in terms of obligation. So that's pretty much a question of timing as the military services gear back up on their execution. The second side is on our services business. We had very slow execution on programs in several civilian agencies, primarily driven by uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels. I suspect some of that we'll obtain through the course of the year until the administration sorts out some of the funding for some of the civilian agencies. But that said, we believe that our products business is poised for growth for the remainder of the year. Recall, we have a very nice backlog in this business, so it's simply a question of timing, when our customers execute programs. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David Strauss at UBS. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason, Alison. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Wanted to ask on cash flow. I think, Jason, you comment that you're still targeting 100% free cash flow conversion for the year, through the first half a little weaker than I expected. Can you just talk about what's going on there? The billed and unbilled receivables, and does that stabilize through the rest of the year or partially reverse, and what exactly is driving that? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. I guess at a macro level, what we've seen through the first half of the year is really on par with what we planned for the year, so nothing out of the ordinary. We expected a bit of a ramp to the second half. So as I mentioned, still targeting at or around 100% conversion. The build-up in working capital, you mentioned was actually anticipated in connection with the Land Systems' international programs. Really what we're seeing there is as we're moving from what we experienced in the past couple of years with large advance payments and then the burn down of those advance payments, which we've talked about ad nauseam at this point. As we move into production, you're seeing a more typical build-up of the unbilled receivables prior to delivery. And as we then move into a ramp up of deliveries, we'll begin to liquidate that unbilled receivables and we expect to see that to start to turn in the second half, and hence, a bit more of the ramp in the cash flow in the second half. So all part and parcel of moving from the development phase of that contract into production and a subsequent ramp in deliveries. So we'll see that unwind beginning in the second half. David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned at Bernstein. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: On Gulfstream, Phebe, you've talked in the past about your pipeline being very strong, and I think you're reiterating that today. But one of the things that you've raised is the fact that it's been a little slower converting interest into firm orders. Could you give us a sense from the discussions you're having, and I would say both in the U.S. and abroad, with customers, are there things that are slowing them down, in other words, are they looking for signals, economic signals, you had mentioned Brexit a while back when that happened, what are you seeing holding people back? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Nothing. Actually, no substantive issue in particular, simply more rigor as they move into the contracting process. So I don't see any macro reasons. We have identified none that we've got potential customers who are waiting on the sidelines, it's simply just taking longer for a whole series of reasons. Everything from the introduction of brokers to additional board approvals, so for fleet aircraft purchases. Those are constant, but there's nothing in particular that's driving this other than I think this is just a new regular order. It's going to just take longer from the time you enter the pipeline to the time you sign the contract. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And presumably, your transition to the new models, I would think would be a part of this too? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. I don't think that there's anything particular about those new models that would change the length of time that we're experiencing. I think that's a structural change. It's simply around timing. It's taking a bit longer, and we've learned to adjust to it. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Myles Walton at Deutsche Bank. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I was hoping to follow-up on Gulfstream. I think, Phebe, you mentioned that there'd be no G500 deliveries in 2017. I thought there was going to be one. And then also the sales guidance ticking down, is that the slippage of a few deliveries, or is that just the G500 and maybe used aircraft in isolation? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, there are a couple of things that are affecting the revenue. We anticipate lower \u2013 now, we anticipate lower pre-owned, that carries with it, with a lower pre-owned sales that reduces revenue, but increases margin. We have a few \u2013 fewer G450 deliveries and then just lots of other puts and takes. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Nothing on the certification, EIS (27:01)? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, no, we're good with that. We're on track. The certification and flight test program is proceeding very, very well. And Jason can give you just a little bit more color on the \u2013 this really is the essence of the change of the impact of revenue recognition. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. I mean, we had talked about for a while dating back entry into service this year, and that's still, as Phebe pointed out in her remarks, the demonstrator aircraft will enter service this year. So we'll complete certification, get type certification, enter that aircraft into service, but that, of course, won't have a revenue implication, that's what she was referring to in her remarks. But nothing otherwise off-schedule or off-plan from what we had anticipated this year. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Robert Spingarn at Credit Suisse. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just sticking with Aerospace and Gulfstream, you still \u2013 despite the sequential downtick, the margins are still excellent, and I would think that mix is trending away from some of the more mature programs, and so how \u2013 Phebe, where would you say the G650 margins are today relative to G450, G550 at peak maturity? How much more runway do you have there to offset the mix of the new aircraft as they come in? And then will there be any margin support at some point from reduced R&D or you're going to keep that level? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the G650 margins have exceeded the G450 and G550 at their peak. And you ask a question that I ask Gulfstream frequently, how much better can we do? And we will do better, the quantum of which we'll have to see. But we've come down our learning curve. That purpose-built facility has turned out to be an operating mix-up (29:10) for us. It's been really nice fit for our guys to be able to get sequential airplane-over-airplane improvement. So I suspect we have more to go. You're never done in the continuous improvement. The R&D, you can anticipate our R&D spending to be about the same level. We have a very robust R&D pipeline, product pipeline, so obviously, that is that (29:38). Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Cai von Rumohr at Cowen. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much, Phebe. So GD always has kind of prided itself on focus on return of capital. With stock prices moving up and your own moving up, reducing the leverage of stock repurchase, at what point does it make sense to shift the focus from repurchase to M&A? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, when attractive, accretive and strategically important target cross our path. So that heretofore has yet to happen. But nonetheless, we don't really comment on this as you well know, but we're certainly not \u2013 we're certainly predisposed to be interested should our criteria be met. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gursky at Citi. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, I was wondering if we could spend a few minutes back on Marine and have you talk a little bit about your view of the world on undersea unmanned, kind of what that market looks like and what do you think GD's strategy might be and maybe what some of the challenges are in that market? And then maybe just to add on some comments here at the end about the demand out at NASSCO with Jones Act and the LNG products that you can produce out there, kind of what the pipeline looks like for those ships? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure, sure. So as you well know, we are fully embedded in the undersea warfare element of the Navy's shipbuilding budget. We are \u2013 we've been very encouraged to see the Navy's interest in additional SSN Virginia-class. I think they increased recently their shipbuilding plan by 18 SSNs, that's about a 38% increase from 48 to 66, consist of Virginia-class. So that would be very, very encouraging, if that comes to pass. We will see. We're positioning ourselves, as you all know, for the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. The design is going extremely well, and we're on track to begin the build process exactly when we thought we would. So we see the undersea deterrent and the undersea war-fighting capability of the U.S. Navy as a key national security imperative as clearly evidenced by the Navy's interest in increasing subs. With respect to NASSCO, interesting to speculate for a moment, NASSCO has continued to perform very, very well. We have the potential for an additional ESB, I think that would be ESB 6. That's a program formerly known as MLP. And we'll see if that comes to pass. We also have \u2013 the Navy's given us long-lead funding for the second oiler, and there's an opportunity to accelerate that program to two ships a year, should the Navy so choose. But frankly, all of this takes money, so we're going to have to see how the budget process shakes out and what programs receive what funding and when. Operator : The next question comes from Howard Rubel at Jefferies. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Hi, thank you very much. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Howard. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: So you've got a whole host of opportunities in front of you, Phebe, and two sort of stand out. One is there's a lot of FMS deals that have been announced, but not yet contracted, and then the G550 platform clearly has a number of military applications that range from domestic to international. Could you put a fence around it or bracket some of this and help us a little bit with timing? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So on the FMS, for those programs that flow through FMS, we expect Kuwaiti tanks and tanks for the Kingdom in the fourth quarter. The tanks for the Kingdom have already received Congressional approval. Primarily, we see the FMS used for tanks, less so on the wheeled vehicle side. We also see FMS for our munitions and armaments business, and that has been proceeding quite nicely, not in the big ticket items that the tanks represent, but nonetheless nice steady volume. With respect to the G550, the G550 is, as I'm sure you know, in service in a number of non-U.S. Air Forces in the ISR mission. And by the way, when we talk about special mission, we mean the ISR mission and we mean Medevac primarily. So \u2013 but on the ISR front, the G550 has been in service in some cases for many years in a couple of countries and performed extremely well. To the extent that there are opportunities for the G550 in the U.S. Air Force market, the Air Force will tell you \u2013 tell us if they want our airplane. They don't, they don't. We're \u2013 Air Force programs, we're not that intimate with the Air Force, so I tend to defer any questions on the big Air Force programs to the prime. But with respect to the G550, I think it stands on its own merit. I think there are also some opportunities moving away from the ISR front if you look at the U.S. Air Force and some potential opportunities to refresh some of the executive transport airplanes. But that is a longer-term potential program. I would note that a number of the airplanes are getting a little old in the Air Force executive transportation fleet. So that's again their call and we'll be prepared to respond to whatever their requirements are of us. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Phebe, I wondered if you could talk to us about the review of WIN-T that General Milley is undertaking and the decision by Senate authorizers to reduce funding and kind of how you see the future of the program from here? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. The Army, as it's been widely reported, reviewing its networking and communication strategy, including, but not limited to, WIN-T. And as you can well imagine, we're working very closely with our customers to respond to any changing requirements. And those will play out over time to the extent that there are any. We don't see any significant risk, by the way, in this year to our WIN-T estimate. To give you just a little bit more color, we have a long-standing, 20-year, networking expertise in land forces \u2013 tactical land forces network, and we think that positions us very well to work with our Army customer now and in the future. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Peter Arment at Baird. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Phebe, on Aerospace in particular, I guess, it's been a while since we've talked about Jet Aviation. Maybe you could just give us an update on how that business is doing and is it growing, and what are the prospects you're seeing out there for that? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. So Jet Aviation is doing quite well. Their services businesses are up, again, primarily driven by increased flying hours. And their completion revenue and earnings are down a bit due in part to reduced inductions from Bombardier and St. Louis, but we're doing very well in Basel on our completions programs as we transition from engineering to production on several airplanes. So Jet Aviation, both on its services side and its completions side, continues to perform very nicely. Operator : The next question is from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Phebe, in your commentary, you mentioned that the margin in IS&T was exceptional in the quarter. Does this imply that you don't expect this level of return to be sustained over the medium to long term? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, I think I meant exceptional in the sense that it was noteworthy, not that it was rare. As I think we're guiding you to margins in the 11.3% to 11.4% range. I anticipate that we will have no trouble in meeting that spot on. I don't expect any upside beyond that. But these businesses have performed very, very well. Our attention to cost, schedule and performance has really driven the bottom line in both those services business and the products business and communications networking and Intel. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, thank you. Can you hear me? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Great, thanks. Phebe, a little more on G650, can you comment on how you're thinking about rate there in the next year given the comment on strong demand and how the sales effort for the ER conversions are progressing? And then maybe to that a little more, can you talk about the margin profile on the ER variant, is that really a whole lot different than the non-ER model? Thank you so much. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, I'll take the questions in inverse order. I'm not going to parse the differences in margins between the G650 and the G650ER. But as we've been talking about for some time, G650 production is going to come down somewhat in each of the next three years. We increased the production to help us in this transition period as we move from the G450 to the G500 in particular. And so our expectation, the balancing that we've been doing this year and into next is that as the G650 revenue begins to decline, the G500 and G600 will offset that decline. I might note that the interest in the G650 and G650ER continue to be quite robust. In this quarter, we had the highest number of orders that we've had in the last six quarters for the G650 and G650ER. So that airplane continues to generate an awful lot of interest in the marketplace. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : So there's no thoughts in maybe pushing out the rate cut? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Pushing up the rate? Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : No, pushing out the rate cut, putting it off? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No. I think that as we look at where the G500 is in terms of orders and our production schedule on the G500, we're comfortable that we can offset the somewhat reduced G650 sales. But I think that's just prudent business. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you so much. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Peter Skibitski at Drexel Hamilton. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Good morning, guys. Hey, Phebe, I was wondering if you can go further on your thoughts on the fiscal 2018 defense budget just in terms of the markups and the signals you're getting out of Congress, it still seems a bit muddled over there, especially on the Senate side. And I'm wondering if you see a good path to getting \u2013 to eventually getting a budget that's above the President's request or it's just too fuzzy right now? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, if you go back a number of years, I think we used to have insights into the defense budget process, both within any given administration and on Capitol Hill that weren't necessarily widely shared or available. But given the ubiquitous amount of information that flows today, I think you all know as much as I do in terms of specificity. But the President's budget exceeded \u2013 the budget request exceeded the budget caps by $54 billion; OCO, the Overseas Contingency fund has often acted as a relief valve for the caps. So perhaps, Congress will consider doing something like that in addition to being able to can never (43:56) adjust those caps. Both the Senate and House Authorization Bills are significantly in excess of the President's budget. And the House Defense Appropriations Committee is about $135 billion, I think, over the President's request. So look, what does all that mean? Right now, it's a giant fur ball and we're going to have to work through the process and see what comes out the other side. As I noted, I believe that there is real interest and desire in additional defense spending which will manifest itself in some more additional funding and budget for defense. It's just a question of how much and what accounts and when. So we still have ways to work through this process. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you very much. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Amy, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : The final question is from George Shapiro at Shapiro Research. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, George. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Hi, Phebe. Typical question for you. If you look at the Gulfstream margin in Q3 and assume it's like it was maybe this quarter, it implies the fourth quarter has got to really drop to 16% or so to get to your guidance. And if you're not going to deliver a G500 in the fourth quarter, so what happens in Q4 to get that big contraction in the margin? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I'll let Jason attack that one. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: George, I mean, obviously, we can try to reconcile the math, I don't think ours is worked out exactly as yours is suggesting. That's probably not totally unusual. But I think the two bigger issues are a little bit of a downtick in the number of deliveries in the fourth quarter. We've talked about that as it relates to outfitted deliveries under the new standard versus our old revenue recognition model. So that is baked into plan. And then it's somewhat bit of a mix there. So more significantly the volume of deliveries, there's a little bit of mix issue affecting the margin. But I don't think it's down quite as dramatically as you're suggesting. It is definitely off as implied in Phebe's guidance. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : But let me follow-up, Jason, I mean, you said deliveries for this year would be about equal to last year and the first half is pretty close to the first half of last year. So the Q3 delivery is then going to be a lot bigger and the Q4 one is down, or how does deliveries going to spread out over Q3 and Q4? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I don't have the Q3 in front of me, directly, I do know that Q4 is off a little bit. I also know that last year was particularly lumpy. The second quarter was a bit of a spike. So we can parse through the quarterly deliveries, but 4Q is definitely off slightly and that's what's the largest impact driving the margin difference. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: You're welcome. Alison Harbrecht - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a great day.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. Please go ahead, sir. William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Denise, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'd like to start by sharing with everyone that Phebe is not able to be here today as she was unfortunately hit with a bad case of the flu. She's asked me to cover today's call, and I've invited our Controller, Bill Moss, to join me. We all wish Phebe a full and speedy recovery. But for now, let's get on with the results. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another strong quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.52 per fully diluted share on revenue of $7.58 billion; operating earnings of $1.052 billion; and income from continuing operations of $764 million, a 10.1% return on sales. The EPS performance was $0.16 better than the year ago quarter and $0.09 better than consensus. Against the year ago quarter, revenue was down $77 million, or 1%, but operating earnings were up $37 million, a 3.6% increase; and income from continuing operations was up $33 million, a 4.5% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 13.9% is 60 basis points better than the third quarter of 2016. Once again, we enjoyed very positive operating leverage. Sequentially, revenue was down $95 million, or 1.2%, while operating earnings were down $4 million and operating margin was up 10 basis points. From an operating perspective, the second and third quarters look a lot alike as we said they would. The $0.07 EPS improvement was driven by a modestly lower share count and a 180-basis point lower effective tax rate in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was off $211 million, less than 1%. However, operating earnings are up $177 million, or 6%, and operating margins are up 90 basis points. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations are also up $177 million, or 8.4%; and earnings per share from continuing operations are up $0.71, 10.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had very efficient conversion in the quarter. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $871 million and free cash flow from operations of $751 million. For the year-to-date, we have cash flow from operations slightly in excess of $1.6 billion. As you can see from the charts attached to our press release, an important story in the quarter was the very healthy backlog increase. The total backlog of $63.9 billion is a $5.4 billion increase, in excess of 9% over the second quarter. There was very good contract activity in all of our groups, with particularly strong order intake in the Marine group. I should point out that each of our defense businesses enjoyed backlog growth, with the exception of NASSCO, and it didn't miss by much. Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, and I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $70 million, or 3.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2016; and operating earnings increased $8 million, or 2.1%, to $385 million on an operating margin of 19.3%. On a sequential basis, the group experienced $83 million less in revenue, about 4%, and a $40 million reduction in operating earnings attributable to a 120-basis point contraction in margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up $157 million, or 2.6%; and operating earnings are up $120 million, or 10.6%, on a 150-basis point improvement in operating margin. We had good order intake in the quarter for the group of 0.8 to 1 book to bill measured on a dollar value of orders basis. But Gulfstream alone was a 0.9 to 1 book to bill on both a dollar value and a number of units basis. I can also tell you that our pipeline and active sale discussions are quite good. We're, again, reasonably optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter and I expect it to look much like the third quarter, if not somewhat better. Our certification flying continues to progress well, including the additional test points required to extend the G500 and G600 range. As we announced during the recent NBAA Air show, additional testing has enabled us to increase the G500 range by 200 nautical miles at 0.85 mach and 600 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. It's really quite remarkable that the G500, with a 5200-nautical mile range at 0.85 mach, can travel 4400 nautical miles at 0.90. This was the approximate range of the G450 at 0.80 mach. On the G600, our additional validation tests have proven an additional 300 nautical miles at 0.85 mach as well as 300 nautical miles at 0.90 mach. The additional testing required for the specific fuel consumption and center of gravity test points have ensured proper performance and safety margins in both aircraft. Although this lengthened the program schedule, we believe the resultant value to our customers was worth the effort. While flying has progressed on schedule, testing by one of our suppliers for component level qualification associated with the concurrent FAA and EASA certification has added a new complexity at the end of the program. While we accounted for this type of supplier impact in our plan, one of our suppliers apparently didn't anticipate the additional EASA test requirements and is somewhat behind. We expect to resolve this issue and deliver the G500 to our customers as planned. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. So we're still on track and we continue to monitor the supplier closely as we near the end of the certification program. Turning to Combat Systems, the group had an excellent quarter with revenue of $1.5 billion, operating earnings of $247 million, and a really strong 16.5% operating margin. As you would expect, the quarter-over-quarter, sequential, and year-to-date comparisons are all quite favorable. Compared to third quarter of 2016, revenue was up $173 million, or 13%, and earnings were up $38 million, or 18.2%, on an 80-basis point improvement in margin. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $86 million, or 6.1%, and operating earnings were up $22 million, or 9.8%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up over 2016 by $332 million, or 8.6%. Operating earnings are up $76 million, or 12.6%, on a 60-basis point improvement in operating margin. Combat Systems remains on course for a very good year. We fully anticipate that the fourth quarter will see around a 15% increase in revenue over this quarter, but also some degradation in operating margin as a result of a mix shift to new programs, so that the increase in operating earnings will be more modest than the revenue increase. All of our major programs are performing very well. We continue to see opportunities for growth both internationally and domestically for the group. The Marine group reported revenue of $1.93 billion, a $144 million or 6.9% decrease compared to the year ago quarter. Similarly, revenue was down sequentially by $148 million, or 7.1%, and year-to-date revenue of $5.94 billion was lower by $231 million, or 3.7%. Revenue across the year has been down based on Virginia-class Block III timing, a slowdown in the Columbia program design work as a result of extended negotiations over the IPPD contract, and the wind down of some of the commercial work at NASSCO. These revenue headwinds are now largely behind us. Operating earnings for the third quarter, that's $179 million, were down by $18 million compared to last year's quarter. On a sequential basis, the group's operating margins improved 70 basis points, which led to a $1 million increase in operating earnings despite the $148 million decrease in revenue. It's very nice to have margins in the group north of 9% once again. While this is encouraging, we'll have to see whether it's sustainable. And finally, IS&T. While IS&T's revenue at $2.15 billion was down $176 million or 7.6% against last year's quarter, it was up $50 million sequentially. Year-to-date revenue of $6.4 billion is down $469 million or 6.8% over last year. However, we expect a strong fourth quarter and we'll be especially flat with 2016 for the year. Revenue has been lower during the year primarily on timing. Lower than expected army product sales impacted the third quarter and the Army had trouble executing after the six-month CR and, of course, the change in administration slowed some execution as well. We'll recover a lot of this revenue in the fourth quarter but don't have enough time to recover at all. Some anticipated revenue will slip into next year, but we're in a good position to hold 2017 revenue close to the 2016 level. In sharp contrast, operating earnings of $253 million were up $14 million, or 5.9%, compared to the third quarter of last year on the strength of a 140- basis point improvement in operating margins. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Operating earnings were up $13 million (sic) [$14 million] (10:43) or 11.7% operating margins, which is a 30-basis point improvement. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings are up $19 million, a 2.7% increase, on a 110-basis point improvement in the operating margins. So IS&T has managed to overcome less than anticipated revenue with very strong operating performance. So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned? We fully expect the fourth quarter to look much like the other three from an operating earnings perspective. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate in the quarter, leading to a lower reported EPS. For the year, stronger than expected operating results year-to-date, a lower than planned tax rate, and a modestly lower share count enable us to increase guidance for the year by $0.05. Our guidance for EPS from continuing operations now goes to a range from $9.75 to $9.80. This late in the year, we anticipate our end of year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. And finally, in closing, as tempting as it is at this time of year to ask about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall, when the businesses get better insight into the upcoming year. The guidance that we gave you last January was grounded in that process and, as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from us in detail in January, as has been our custom for many years. I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill to cover some additional financial items. William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Jason. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the third quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense year-to-date to $76 million versus $68 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in 2017 is due to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter last year. For 2017, we expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, which includes the impact of the issuance of $1 billion of debt in the third quarter in anticipation of the repayment of $900 million in notes maturing in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.6% for the quarter and 25.8% year-to-date. We're lowering our target for the full year to a rate of approximately 27%. The lower rate in the quarter and our reduced forecast for the year are both attributable to the finalization of open tax years and a greater benefit from employee stock option exercises than previously forecast. On the capital deployment front, in the third quarter we purchased 1.2 million shares, bringing us to 5.9 million shares in the first nine months of 2017 for $1.1 billion. In total, when combined with the dividends we paid through the first nine months, we've spent $1.9 billion or nearly 120% of our free cash flow year-to-date. We've also made a number of small acquisitions in our aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $364 million. This left us at the end of the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and a net debt position of $2.2 billion. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year to approach 100% of earnings from continuing operations, and will continue to deploy 100% of that free cash flow, less the amount spent on acquisitions, to dividends and share repurchases. With that, we will move to the Q&A. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : I would be happy to, sir. And the first question will come from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Jason and everyone else. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good Morning. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wondering if you wouldn't \u2013 going into a little bit more detail on the supplier issue on the G500 and just kind of let us know whether this is a sole-source kind of position for this supplier or maybe a little bit more color on what kind of part this might be. And more specifically even on 2018, kind of when in the year you expect at this point for deliveries to make and whether you'll continue kind of plugging along on production at this point so that expectations around deliveries for the full year of 2018 are kind of no different than where we were, say, back in July during the last earnings call? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So first off, I'm really not at liberty to get into any specifics around the specific supplier. That's somewhat confidential information that Gulfstream needs to deal with. But I can tell you that this is not an issue that has to do with anything related to flight tests or the flying capabilities or the readiness of the airplane to go into service. This is strictly a paperwork exercise that we're going through and, really, it has to do with, as we've noted, the additional test points that have allowed the additional range as well as I mentioned the simultaneous \u2013 this is the first time we've done a simultaneous FAA and EASA \u2013 that's the European Aviation Authority (sic) [European Aviation Safety Agency] (16:19) \u2013 certification. And really, that is a benefit to our customers, to achieve those simultaneous certifications so that we can accommodate the deliveries to our international customers. But long story short, this is not any type of risk item to the program. It's strictly a matter of getting through paperwork through that certification process. As it relates to 2018, as I mentioned, deliveries are still on schedule with our original plan and our original contractual customer dates. You may recall that for a while there we were optimistically considering that there might be an opportunity to advance that entry into service by three or four months. We had this opportunity to go after additional capability in the aircraft, and we did that knowing that we would still be able to meet our original customer commitments while achieving that additional capability. So really, no impact there. And likewise to your question, no impact on our expected 2018 delivery. The production and the delivery schedule remain intact as we originally anticipated, and so we don't see any modification there. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So Jason, I wanted to ask you about Marine. You talked a little bit about the nice uptick in the backlog there. And at the very end of the quarter, I think you took in a big Columbia order and then two destroyers, one Flight II and one Flight III. I'm curious how much risk you see and the impact on margins from this AMDR Flight III Destroyer, and in the margin profile on Columbia as we go forward here. It may not matter that much this year. I know you don't want to get into 2018, but I'm interested in the margin progression given that these destroyers are fixed-price incentive fee contracts and that we're bringing in this Columbia work. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So as we've talked about, and I think you hit on it, the Columbia I think is the primary driver that we'll see, if for no other reason, just the volume impact it has as we continue to grow in the Marine Systems group throughout the balance of the decade. And as we've talked about, it is a development cost-plus type contract, so it will come at relatively lower margins that will continue to have a modest dilutive effect for the group. So that's no different I think than what we've talked about up to this point. It's good to have that contract in place so we can keep moving forward, but the margin impact is consistent with what we've talked about historically. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Jason, is there a way to quantify the mix of Columbia as a percentage of Marine as we go forward here? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't have that in front of me. What I can tell you is that the growth profile that we laid out, which, really, we anticipated being off a little bit this year in volume and then picking up in 2018 and beyond until the end of the decade, the growth profile, if you follow that CAGR, is almost entirely attributable to Columbia. And it's essentially this design work. So you can put some orders of magnitude on it around there as it relates to the growth of the business and those relatively diluted margins. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just Flight III versus II. It's something that we think about as being higher risk. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So it's obviously a relatively significant change to the platform, with the additional radar capabilities. But we feel like we got to a place with the customer where we balanced the need to meet their requirements with the maturity of our design, and it's a balanced risk and opportunity situation. We feel very comfortable with the estimate we've put forth and we wouldn't have put a bid in if we didn't think we could do that. So we're still coming out of, as we've long talked about, some of the issues we had at Bath Iron Works with the four-year production break on the DDG-51 Destroyer line. So we feel very good about the progress they've made. We've got to keep watching that and making progress to see that it's sustainable, but we see this as fitting in very nicely to that book of business. I think we have seven destroyers in backlog at this point of the DDG-51 variety, and we think this is very wholesome for Bath Iron Works. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So you can hold margins as you transition on that program? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I have every reason to believe that, yes. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just to follow-up on the G500 question from earlier. I appreciate that you guys are on plan with regard to the original target entry into service date. A year ago on the call the company talked about the G500 making a significant contribution. I assume that meant to EBIT in 2018. Is that still the case? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Absolutely. Nothing has come off that. And so recall, there's been a lot of discussion around, is EIS going to be at the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 \u2013 we were talking about EIS as a demonstrator model because of the demand requirements that our sales organization was having. And so there's been a lot of back-and-forth over when is the first unit going to be there and what's that going to look like. But fundamentally, two things. With the new revenue recognition protocol, that was never going to be a big impact on 2017, hence the more significant impact in 2018 that we described. And as I said at the outset in the earlier question, the production and delivery schedule we're still adhering to and are on track for. So continue to see 500 ramp-up in 2018 as having a meaningful impact as we draw down. We'll deliver the last 450 in January of next year. We'll continue to draw down the 550 and we'll start to feather out a couple of 650s. So the 500 is a major contributor among those factors. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then Jason, maybe if you could just describe the acquisitions that you made, kind of what they are and how much they're contributing. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So we've had a number over the year. They've been mostly small in nature. The more recent one was a business in our IS&T group, really out of our IT services business. And it specializes in mission support for the intelligence community, so it fits right in our core as it relates to the GDIT services and a growth market for us. It closed right near the end of the third quarter, in mid to late September, so not really much of an impact. In fact, no really impact at all in the third quarter but we'll expect to see that to start to contribute in the fourth quarter and beyond. The other acquisitions were a couple of small aerospace services business and another mission computing business that we acquired earlier in the year at smaller amounts. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Operator : The next question will come from Rob Epstein (sic) [Ron Epstein] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning, Jason. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey. Good morning. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just maybe a bigger question for you. When you look at the balance sheet of the corporation, right, you guys are really not very levered at all. And when you think about the efficiency of the balance sheet, is there more you could be doing with it? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: We've spoken for some time about the fact that, A, we don't have a target balance sheet leverage position; we really are more focused on a couple of things. Number one is maintaining the balance sheet firepower that we have for strategic opportunities that will enable long-term growth. So with the free cash flow we have and the balance sheet capacity that we've had, we've been able to do things like invest in capital facilities, invest in product development across the portfolio, Gulfstream, now Electric Boat in the facility. As well as of course deploy meaningful amounts of capital; in this case, primarily to shareholders in the form of dividends and the share repurchase. I think as we look forward, a couple of things. We like our credit rating, where we stand today, and we don't look to modify that. But certainly, we see the balance sheet as an opportunity for when and if strategic opportunities come up, that we are ready to be agile and move quickly with those opportunities. You saw that in a small dose here in the first nine months. That's a little bit more of a toe in the water compared to where we've been for the past few years. Where that leads us, we'll see. It really is all about continuing to find accretive opportunities that are in our core, and that's really never changed. That's always been the case and that really is what we hold that balance sheet firepower for. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And is it safe to assume if there aren't accretive opportunities that come along that you guys are interested in, you would pick up the return to shareholders either through the dividend or the buyback? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So we'll continue to evaluate that on an annual basis. Right now, that continues to be our cadence through the balance of the year. I'm sure you've heard Phebe talk about priorities on capital deployment, that the dividend should be predictable and repeatable and sustainable, so we'll look to continue that. And share repurchase, of course, as always, we do not view that as a strategy. It's been a tactical approach to how we deploy capital, and we'll continue to frankly take it that way. So I think no real change that I foresee in that regard. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Yes, thank you very much. So if you're late, there've been some rumors that the G500 might not deliver until midyear. Do you expect to deliver in the first quarter still? And if there is an additional delay, what kind of impact do you expect that to have on cash? And lastly, your competitor, the 5X at Falcon, clearly has had another extended delay. Do you expect or have you seen any pickup in orders as a result of that? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So I don't know of anything about the 500 delay until midyear. Like I said, we remain on track for deliveries in the early part of 2018. So rumors are rumors. I don't necessarily want to speak to that kind of speculation but we remain on track with our contractual delivery timing. And so as it relates to further delays, it would also be, I think, somewhat speculative. I don't know what that would look like, and frankly don't anticipate them, so I don't see an impact to cash or otherwise associated. We are on track and feel good about our ability to close on the certification and get the airplane into service in accordance with our original contractual commitments. As it relates to competition, we tend not to speculate about them or gauge our performance based on what others are doing. It's fair to say over the past couple of years that we have been the beneficiary of taking some share in this market. It's not something we focus on; it's just a fact. But obviously, if they continue to have issues, if others continue to have issues, we'll continue to do our best to perform and be as competitive as we can be in this market. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC: Thanks so much. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Absolutely. Operator : The next question will be from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Myles. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just part one on cash flow, if I could. I think you mentioned that cash flow return in the form dividends and share repurchase would be 100%, but now it would be 100% after your spend on acquisitions, which I think is a nuance to your price. I'm asking you to just confirm that. And secondly, on the cash flow in the quarter and the full year, did you do the pension contribution in 3Q and what in particular is going to allow you to get to 100% for the full year in 4Q? Thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So on the first question, you read that correctly. It may be a subtlety that we're articulating because it's relevant in the moment, but it's always been our approach that, with respect to capital deployment, I mentioned a minute ago the dividend approach, that steady and repeatable M&A is there if and when we find accretive and core acquisitions, and then the residual from a tactical standpoint is share repurchase. So I don't think that's any different than what we've talked about; it's just that they've become relevant as you've seen it here in the third quarter of this year. So that is absolutely the case. As it relates to pension, we did make our scheduled pension contribution so no change to the outlook. With respect to that, for the year I believe the number was somewhere in the ballpark of $200 million. I don't think that's changed. And as it relates to closing out the year, we've got a big fourth quarter lined up but frankly that's not unusual for us. It's a pretty typical pattern for us. And one of the things we, I think, would look to as the biggest driver behind the ramp there in the fourth quarter is the transition to billing and delivery and collection on these major international programs is starting to unwind a good bit of that working capital in the fourth quarter. That's the single biggest driver that brings us down that curve. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just to clarify. So if M&A continues to be a few $100 million at a time though, that's actually subtractive from the 100% return and the balance sheet kind of just gets preserved in terms of the leverage you currently have and there's no net increase in leverage from M&A? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't want to speak to long-term leverage. We'll get into that depending on the deals that may be out there. I think as it relates to the impact on share repurchase, as I've said, that's always tactical. And while we targeted a 100% return between dividends and share repurchase modified by the acquisition activity, that's a rough number because it's tactical; it's something we shoot for. If it were a penpoint, sort of bullet point at the target, then it wouldn't be tactical; we'd be driving toward a fixed answer. And if you look back over the past couple years, we've in fact well exceeded the 100% return benchmark, and this year we're on target to meet that. So I don't know that it has any direct implication. We'll just have to assess each of those opportunities when they come up and see what they do with respect to the implications on the long-term leverage. Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Operator : The next question will come from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just want to talk about the fourth quarter in terms of some of the comments you made. So you said Combat could be up 15% sequentially. That means it's up, call it, 5.5% to 6%. And for the year, that seems like it's a little bit lower than the 7% plan. I just want to make sure I'm doing that correctly. And then second, in IS&T, with this big ramp-up in the fourth quarter, I'm wondering how much of that 20-something percent year-over-year growth that you need to get is coming from this acquisition versus the remainder of the business? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So I'd have to check, and we can go back offline and discuss the math, but the 15-ish percent increase sequentially is entirely consistent with our original forecast of the Combat Systems group being up 7%, maybe a touch higher, approximately 7% full year over 2016. So we're very comfortable with that and that's in the backlog. As a relates to IS&T, as I've said, it is a steep curve in the quarter but we feel very good about it. The pieces are in place to achieve that growth. There are a lot of moving parts but it's in the backlog. We had a good September which leads us to feel like we're very well-positioned to close out the year in a strong fashion. Most of that growth is coming out of the products business, and the order cadence is there to support that. So again, while there's a lot of moving parts, we feel very good about where we are and the pieces are in place to get there. In terms of the impact of the acquisition, I would say that's not the big driver. It has an impact, but to be honest with you I don't actually have that number in front of me. The big driver is the catch up from the timing we've seen throughout the year and its impact that it's had on our Mission Systems product business. We've talked a good bit about those timing effects of the Army procurement and some of the civil agencies and so on that we've seen delayed by the six-month-plus CR and so on. But we feel good about that timing starting to catch back up this year. If we don't get fully back to the 2016 level, it'll be close and that timing will just spill over a little bit into 2018. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Operator : The next question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I wanted to stay on IS&T because you're talking about some real progress there, but at the same time we've seen the Army decision to halt WINT-T and you all didn't make it through the down select on JTRS. How are you looking at Army communications now longer-term? Is this an area where \u2013 I mean, how should we expect those program situations to affect IS&T longer-term? And is this an area that you perhaps need to shore up or invest in? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. So look, I think bottom line, when you think about this tactical network backbone for the Army, that is absolutely as square in our core as anything else that's out there, and so we feel very good about the fact that we will continue to be a player from a systems integration role moving forward. Obviously, the Army is yet to define what its revised tactical networking baseline is going to be, so we don't want to get out ahead of that. But as we see it right now, the decisions that have been made to-date and what's on the table at this point has a minimal revenue impact, if any, to 2018. So we feel very comfortable with where we're headed for 2018. And frankly, beyond that, the impact will depend on future Army decisions, so it probably wouldn't be appropriate to speculate and get out ahead of them at this point. What I can tell you, as you are well aware, IS&T is a makeup of a vast portfolio of lots of different opportunities and programs. And so even this one, if it has some impact, is not going to be one that changes our overall long-term outlook for the group. So we feel comfortable that our multi-year CAGR for the group, which I think we gave you at 4.5% or so, remains intact at this point. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's good; even if you should not get back in on whatever replaces WIN-T, you still feel pretty good about that growth level. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: We do feel good. Yes. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey. Good morning, Jason. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Carter. How are you? Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Good. I wonder if you could expand, since it's not in the release, but with respect to the margin strength, was there anything to note from a gross favorable, EAC adjustments or anything like that? Maybe you could give us some color on how those looked favorable versus unfavorable by segment just to kind of give us some color on what was in there in the margins. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I don't have it by segment in front of me. I know the number in aggregate for the quarter was right around $100 million, which was off a little bit from the second quarter but higher than the first quarter, and that's, of course, right in line with the increased variability we anticipated seeing with these changes under the new revenue recognition model. It did have a good favorable effect on IS&T. I think we had 11.7% margins in the quarter for IS&T. That's not likely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, albeit the margins will continue to be strong for the group in the fourth quarter, but we'll see that come back down a little bit. A little bit of an impact in Combat Systems but not too, too much with respect to changes in estimates or true ups. And in Marine Systems, we did see a couple of modest, albeit a handful of booking rate changes on some of those programs which, in this case, all just happen to line up positively, and so you saw the strong margin in Marine Systems in the quarter. So I would frankly expect to see the Marine Systems margin tick back down a little bit in the fourth quarter but still to show good progress in those yards. So bottom line, it had an effect. It was favorable to the quarter but not in an outsized way compared to where we've been in the past. And again, barring a similar trend in the fourth quarter, we expect to see some of those margins notch back down just a little bit to a range that we consider to be more normal. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Operator : The next question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Jason, I thought I would just follow-up on the M&A that you did this year. I know it's relatively small, but does this signal that you're perhaps a little bit more open to do deals going forward? Or does this show that some of the prices have come in relative to what you think is fair, or that some specific assets came up for sale? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. I really don't think this signals any difference in our perspective or our approach to the market. While we've been fairly quiet on this front for the past few years, it doesn't mean that there hasn't been sort of activity under the surface in terms of looking and evaluating things that are out there. As I've said before, we will continue and will always look at deals that are accretive and are in our core, whether they're large or small. And in this case, a couple of them happen to come in. To speculate about what the future would look like would probably be getting a little bit out ahead of ourselves because I really just don't see what that is. But this will always be our approach until I'm told that it's not. And it's just, again, a focus on accretive core deals and we'll announce them as they come. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just a follow-up. When you say accretive, are you talking earnings accretive, free cash accretive, and over what period? Is it by year two or something like that? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: So specifically, earnings accretive in the first full year. Obviously, if you bring it in late in the year it's going to have a hard time overcoming that geometry. But, yeah, accretive in the first full year and that's earnings accretive and, of course, the cash to follow. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey. Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Jason. Can you update us on your expectation for Gulfstream mid and large cabin deliveries for this year? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah. No change from what we've talked about earlier. We're still looking to be right at about 120 deliveries for the year. I think if I recall, I don't have it right in front of me, but that's 89 or 90 large cabin and 30 or 31 mid cabin, so that remains unchanged. Obviously, as you get toward the end of the year, you could see a unit flip back or forth, so we'll manage that. But right in line at this point as we look at the balance of the year. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Just as a follow-up. I was wondering if you're seeing any improvement at all in emerging market demand at Gulfstream. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: The markets continue to be solid for us. We've sort of hit a familiar drumbeat, right, throughout the past several quarters and even the past couple years. Emerging markets are showing signs of activity. Our core continues to be North America, and that's where over half of our order activity and backlog is centered. But we're seeing, I'd say, probably another quarter of the activity associated with Asia, Asia Pacific. And then if you take other regions notching down, I'd say Europe, then Latin America, then Mideast Africa, sort of in that order in decreasing amounts. But we are seeing decent order uptick activity and customer interest around the globe. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, Jason. Thanks for taking my question. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. Good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Just within Combat Systems, good revenue growth and good EBIT growth. Can you just attribute that to specific international programs, what the ramp should look like? And you mentioned the margin impact. Maybe if you could walk us through what the impact is, any productivity savings off that. Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the growth in the group so far this year has really largely been attributable to the ramp in the international programs that we've discussed. We've started the delivery process for those programs. And in fact, we're now up at full rate production for the large Middle East program coming out of Canada. We've started to make initial deliveries on \u2013 I think we've made the first handful of deliveries on the UK AJAX program. That will start to build rate and come up to full rate throughout and toward the end of next year, so you'll see some ramp next year attributable to that, and that'll sustain out through the next couple of years and beyond. The Middle East international program, as I've said, is at full rate and will be pretty steady state for the next couple of years. And now we're starting to see the startup of US domestic ground forces recap, and we'll see that more of an influence in the fourth quarter. So I would expect more of the growth that we see in the fourth quarter to be about those programs. And really, that dovetails into your margin question because we'll start to see those coming in at traditional sort of US Defense entry-level program margins, and so that'll have somewhat of a dilutive effect on the Combat Systems group margins in the fourth quarter as we start up those programs. So a really nice layering of the international programs, the Middle East having a big effect this year, Army recap starting this year and moving into next year, and then the UK program ramping next year and beyond. So I think it's a wholesome position for Combat to be in and supported by the tremendous backlog that they see in that group. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Denise, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you, sir. And that will be for Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On the Virginia-class subs, would you have capacity to increase production there to three if there were ever budget support for a higher rate? And then what kind of investment would that require on your part? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Well I think your comments taken in reverse order. Number one is if the money is there to support it, absolutely. I would tell you that we have the capacity to move the rate up, so we're at a steady two per year now in the foreseeable future. There is conversation around what to do in years when a Columbia submarine is delivered, and so we'll have to see if there's opportunity from a budget standpoint to add Virginia-class there. But bottom line, we stand ready to do that. We have the capacity to do it and it frankly comes at a relatively minimal investment. The investments at this point moving forward that we're evaluating for Electric Boat really have to do with the Block V module \u2013 for the Virginia Payload Module on the next Virginia-class contract \u2013 and, of course, the Columbia investments, all of which we're in the process of discussing with the Navy. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. William A. Moss - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3311. Have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Howard A. Rubel: Thank you, Denise, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. A - Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. We are very pleased to have Howard joined our senior leadership team. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.10 per fully diluted share on revenue of $8.28 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $636 million. This result was impacted by a charge arising from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adverse impact was a $119 million and is reflected in an increased tax provision. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this one-time event, we had earnings from continuing operations of $755 million and adjusted EPS per fully diluted share of $2.50. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up $175 million over the year ago quarter. Similarly, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were up $0.61. You can find a more fulsome explanation of this in exhibits A and B of our press release. I suspect you will see a lot more this as other aerospace and defense companies report as you\u2019ve already seen in other market segments. Revenue and operating earnings were up significantly against the year-ago quarter by 8.1% and 34.6%, respectively. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good performance all-around. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $9.56 on revenue of $38.97 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of tax reform, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $9.95 and earnings from continuing operations of $3.03 billion. Revenue from the year was up over 2016 by $412 million or 1.3%. Operating earnings were up $443 million or 11.9% on an 130 basis point improvement in operating margins. Earnings from continuing operations were up $233 million or 8.7% as reported. Adjusted for the impacts of the tax Reform Act charge, earnings from continuing operations were up $352 million, a double-digit increase of 13.1%. All in all, 2017 was a very good year leaving us well-positioned for 2018. Perhaps the most important story in the quarter was the cash performance. Free cash flow from operations was $1.84 billion in the quarter. For the year, we had free cash flow of $3.45 billion. We advised you at the beginning of the year that free cash flow is going to be approximately 100% in net earnings. In fact, it was significantly better than that. Further, we enjoyed $1 billion reduction in operating working capital in the quarter as milestone payments were received at Land Systems and cash deposits were received at Gulfstream. Of note, the cash performance throughout our planning horizon should be very strong. We have a lot to cover this morning, including guidance, so I will view the year in the quarter as adjusted on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to the sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis suffice it to say that we had more revenue and more operating margin. This resulted in operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations that were very similar across all four quarters. Let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, aerospace. Revenue was up against the year-ago quarter by 1. -- $157 million or 8.6% and operating earnings were up $66 million or 24.1%. The result of a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the full-year, revenue of $8.13 billion was up $314 million or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.59 billion were up $186 million, a strong 13.2% advance on a 160 point improvement in operating margins. In sum, an outstanding year at aerospace with strong operating leverage and very good order intake, particularly in the fourth quarter. This time last year we told you to expect revenue between $8.3 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate between 19.1 to 19.2. At year-end, we had higher-margins on somewhat lower revenue driven entirely by negligible pre-owned aircraft sales. By the way, we work really hard to avoid pre-owned sales, because they carry no margin. On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good and pipeline activity was robust. The book-to-bill at aerospace in the fourth quarter was $1.3 to $1 denominated and $1.4 to $1 in units. Let me give you some additional data on the subjects as it relates to the quarter and the year. At Gulfstream, net orders were up over 20% year-over-year. Within that increase, midsize orders were exactly the same as last year. Net large cabin orders were up almost 30%. Most importantly, on a growth basis, G650 and 650ER orders were up 78% year-over-year. This was the best G650, 650 ER order quarter since 2014 when we had a quarter with a number of multi-aircraft customers. It is also the second best quarter for the G650 and 650 ER since in orders terms since the launch in 2008. So we had a nice increase in large cabin orders led by the 650 and 650 ER. As we speak, there are over 280 of these aircraft in service with many early customers returning to buy another. During the quarter, we also announced an increase in the range of the G500 and G600 by 200 and 300 nautical miles, respectively at long-range cruise of .8 Mach. At .9 Mach, we increased the G500 range by 600 nautical miles and the G600 by 300 miles. The increased ranges were proven during flight test and can be attributed to very successful control of the weight of these aircraft. And by the way we announced increases only when we are certain that can be delivered. We also enjoyed both record sales and earnings for the Gulfstream service business in 2017, which leads me to another subject. I rarely speak to you about the overall market. I usually speak to our own demand, which is held up very well in a slow market. We\u2019ve clearly gained share from others in this market. Furthermore, my sense is that order activity and customer interest are picking up across the industry. I will look forward to the reports of other OEMs on this subject as they become available. Next, Combat Systems. At Combat, revenue was $1.75 billion, up $87 million or 5.2% and operating earnings were up $30 million or 13% on the quarter-over-quarter basis on the strength of 110 basis point improvement in operating margins. For the full-year, sales were up $419 million or 7.6%. Operating earnings were up $106 million or 12.8% on an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, very strong operating leverage here. By the way this performance is reasonably consistent with the guidance we provided at this time last year. We actually achieved a better result on somewhat higher revenue and operating margins were 20 basis points better than guidance. We continue to see nice order activity in this group with Q4 orders of $1.7 billion. Tank orders in the quarter were $975 million, part of the $2.4 billion IDIQ type contract that we were awarded in the quarter. Internationally demand remained good. We signed a $1 billion, contract for combat wheel vehicles with Romania earlier this month and the pipeline remains robust, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. In our U.S market, our U.S. Army customer is modernizing, generating demand across our combat vehicle munitions businesses, fueling our .9 to 1 book-to-bill for the year. This is particularly impressive in a year of nice revenue growth. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth with content -- and continued its history of strong operating leverage. For Marine, revenue of $2.1 billion was up $163 million or 8.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $167 million were up $125 million against the year-ago quarter, which included a charge of Bath Iron Works which we discussed with you last quarter. Revenue for the full-year was down $68 million, less than 1% on lower commercial ship revenue at NASCO. Growth will resume in our planning horizon. Operating earnings for the year of $685 million were up $90 million on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margins. So better margins than 2016, but still not where we need to be. At this time last year we told you to expect revenue of $7.9 billion and operating earnings of $680 million to 685 million. So revenue was $104 million higher than forecast, but operating earnings of $685 million were consistent with the upper end of the target range. In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we're investing in each of our yards. We will spend $1.7 billion in CapEx at Electric Boat over the next several years in anticipation of increased production on the Block V Virginia submarine and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. We also have increased our internal training programs as well as our public-private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island, to meet our need for skilled trade. Over the last two years alone, we have hired and trained 4,600 highly capable employees. We were also investing over $200 million in CapEx at Bath and NASSCO to meet the Navy's demand for more destroyers and auxiliary ships. So suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers as they increase the size of the fleet. In the Information Systems and Technology group, revenue in the quarter of $2.49 billion was up $216 million or 9.5% against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $282 million in the quarter were 22.1% better than the fourth quarter a year-ago on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $8.9 billion was down $253 million or 2.8%, but operating earnings of $1.01 billion were up $70 million or 7.4% on the strength of a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. Very good operating performance. Recall that at this time last year we forecast a modest increase in revenue for the year with operating earnings of $1 billion to $1.05 billion and a margin rate of 11%. So the operating earnings came in as guided with lower revenue on a 40 basis point higher margin rate. As we\u2019ve frequently pointed out, IS&T book-to-bill has been at or in excess of one-to-one for each of the past four years resulting in a healthy backlog. That said, the transition of that backlog and revenue has been slower than we originally anticipated. The combination of this ER and a new administration slowed the pace of awards particularly in our Fed civ business. While both defense and Fed civ picked up during the second half of the year, we simply did not have enough time before year-end to recover fully. This leads me to be confident that the growth in this business will materialize beginning in 2018. On this call a year-ago, on a companywide basis, our guidance for 2017 was to expect revenue of $31.35 billion to $31.4 billion and an operating margin of around 13.3%. We wound up the year with revenue of $31 billion, but were at the high-end of our operating earnings expectations because the operating margin of 13.5% was better than anticipated. Most of the revenue shortfall came in the short cycle IS&T segment that we just discussed. Last year this time we provided EPS guidance of $9.50 to $9.55. Without the regard to the $119 million charge related to tax reform, we wound up at $9.95, $0.40 to $0.45 better. So let me provide some guidance for 2018 and some out year commentary on 2019 through 2021 initially by business group and then a companywide rollout. In aerospace, we expect 2018 revenue to be $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion, up $220 million to $270 million. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of 18%. The margin rate is lower in 2017 as a result of mix shift and increased R&D spending as well as a modest increase in pre-owned sales which again carry no margin. In aerospace, for the five year period 2017 through 2021, we expect a sales CAGR of slightly more than 7%. That CAGR rolls up a modest sales increase in 2018 with more significant growth in 2019 and beyond. While it is difficult to predict with fidelity our earnings rate as a result of significant mix shift, we see our earnings growth at a 3.5% to 5% CAGR. We see 2018 as the low point in earnings during the transition to our new models with modest earnings increases in 2019 and 2020 and significant earnings traction in 2021.  In Combat Systems, we expect revenue to be between $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, a $200 million to $250 million increase over 2017 with operating earnings of $970 million, a $33 million increase. This implies a margin rate of around 15.7% very similar to last year. For the period of 2017 to '21, the expected sales CAGR should be in excess of 7% and the earnings CAGR in the low 6% range. The Marine Group is expected to have revenues between $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion of $400 million to $500 million increase over 2017. Operating earnings in 2018 are anticipated to be between to be at 735 to 745, with an operating margin rate of about 8.7%. The 2017 to '21 sales CAGR is expected to be 5.6% with very strong growth in '19 and 2020 and gradually improving operating margins. The expected earning CAGR for the Marine Group from 2017 to 2021 is about 6.7%. Finally in IS&T, we expect revenue in 2018 of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, an increase of $400 million to $500 million. We expect operating earnings to be up $20 million to $30 million over the last year with a margin rate of around 11%. For this group, we see a sales CAGR of 5.5% and an earnings CAGR of 5%. So for 2018 companywide all of this rolls up to $32.35 billion to $32.45 billion of revenue, up 4.4% to 4.8% over 2017. Operating earnings of 4.25% and an operating margin around 13.1%. This rolls up to an EPS guidance of $10.90 to $11 per fully diluted share. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 19% tax provision and assumes we only buy shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effect of capital deployment. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, divide our guidance into four and take $0.35 off Q1, $0.05 off Q2 and Q3 and add $0.45 to Q4. For the period of 2017 to 2021, we see a consolidated sales CAGR of 6.3% and an operating earnings CAGR of 5%. This was simply a rollup of the projections I've given you for each of the business groups. We are quite bullish about the 2018 through 2021 period in all segments. Let me turn this call over to Jason for additional commentary and then we'll take your questions. A - Jason W. Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I will start with the subject that\u2019s getting a lot of attention and impacted both our 2017 results and our outlook going forward, and that\u2019s the recently enacted tax reform and our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 36.9 for the quarter and 28.6% for the full-year. Removing the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate was 25.1% for the quarter and 25.7% for the full-year. The unfavorable impact on our tax provision that Phebe discussed is due primarily to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset at the new lower statutory rate as required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Looking ahead to 2018, we expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 19%. This rate reflects the lower statutory rate on domestic income, the elimination of historic tax benefits such as the domestic production credit and the fact that the tax rate applicable to our international operations are now essentially at parity with our U.S operations, if not slightly higher. This contrasts with our history with a relatively lower taxes on our international operations had a beneficial impact on our consolidated effective tax rate relative to the previous 35% U.S statutory rate. As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefit from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we've not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future option exercises. So we will update our tax rate as they occur. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. That brings net interest expense for the year to $103 million versus $91 million for 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to a $500 million increase in our outstanding debt in the third quarter of 2016. As you will recall, we issued $1 billion of debt in the third quarter of this past year to replace $900 million of notes maturing in the fourth quarter at a slightly higher interest rate. As a result, we expect 2018 interest expense to increase to approximately $150 million. We ended the year with $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net debt position, debt less cash and equivalents of $1 billion. That\u2019s down from approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2016. As Phebe mentioned, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and we received significant deposits on new aircraft orders and scheduled progress payments on our large international combat vehicle programs. Cash from operations was $2 billion in the quarter and $3.9 billion for the full-year. For 2018, we anticipate cash from operations of approximately $3.7 billion. On the capital deployment front, in the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares bringing us to 7.8 million shares for $1.5 billion for all of 2017. In total, when combined with the dividends paid, we've returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2017, and we've also made several acquisitions in our aerospace and IS&T groups this year totaling $400 million. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed about $200 million to our plans in 2017 as forecast. For 2018, our minimum contribution is approximately $300 million to be paid mostly during the second quarter. We will examine potentially increasing our contribution somewhat as the year progresses in light of the opportunity provided by the recent tax reform. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I will turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard A. Rubel: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Denise, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Certainly, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, a quick question on capital deployment. I was wondering if your plans for future cash deployment have changed as a result of the U.S tax reform, you obviously ended the year with a very strong balance sheet and cash flow? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, let me just reiterate what our tax -- what our cash deployment -- capital deployment strategy has been. First, we invest in our business where we believe that we can get a good return. We are in a period right now of growth that needs to be supported by investments and happily and officiously we\u2019ve a tax bill that gives us more free cash flow. So it's a nice marrying of objective and reality. We also look for transactions, acquisitions that are accretive in our core and you saw some of that this past year in 2017. The only -- and we\u2019ve talked about this for many years, the only long-term steady reliable repeatable elements of cash and capital deployment are dividends. Share repurchases, we cover dilution and then all of our other share repurchases have been tactical. So I don't see a particular change in the strategy. The tactics, of course, are driven by the needs of the business and in the case of tax reform provide us additional free cash flow. So a happy event. Robert Stallard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Robert Spingarn : I wanted to go back to your aero margin guidance for '18 and the small contraction there on the mix shift and the higher R&D and the slightly higher pre-owned I guess. Phebe, with the timing on the 500 and 600 wrapping up, would have thought R&D might have track down a little bit, maybe there's something else you\u2019re developing there and how is pricing on the aircraft that will deliver in '18 versus '17? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, first of all, we never discussed price. But suffice it to say, that is not driving any margin changes or compression. So I think it might be appropriate just to remind ourselves where we've been for the last couple of years and where the next two years, this year and '19 are. So we've been in a transition period and think about the transition in two pieces. One, that we've been living through to the last two years where we're bringing down 455 50 production and offset any earnings decline as a result of that we committed to attempt to keep earnings flat by increasing somewhat the 650 production, which we\u2019ve done in addition to cutting costs and improved operating efficiency and good planning, all of that has happened. Now as we move into the full throttled transition where the 450 is out of production this year, the 550 is coming down to low rate and ultimately very low rate production, we are feathering back from 650s as appropriate and as we told you we would and the advent of the 600 comes on board, 500 and then 600. So we're pretty much on track -- we are very much on track and exactly the progression, the magnitude and the duration of this transition period that we\u2019ve been in. We never discussed our R&D, but again suffice it to say that it has been robust and it will continue to be robust going forward. Robert Spingarn : So, Phebe, if I might, is it -- are you saying it's just a bit of learning curve on the new platforms? Phebe N. Novakovic: Sure. So let's talk about new platforms. Always have a -- they start at a lower margin rate and improve over time if they come down our learning curve. In addition, the first lot of any new airplane -- that\u2019s airplanes tend to carry with them lower margins. So as we get the first lot of the 500 and 600 out at the production line and we improve our learning, which we have done historically and I\u2019m confident we will do again, then we will eventually see margin expansion and that's the kind of earnings growth I\u2019m talking about in the latter end of our planning period. Robert Spingarn : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel Pearlstein : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Samuel Pearlstein : Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the net income conversion to free cash flow in 2018, just given the tax change, the additional pension contribution and then just the capital spending plan? And just overall, does CapEx continue to grow from this level into even next year? Just how do we think about that? Jason W. Aiken: Sure. So, we gave you some figures on operating cash flow in the remarks around call it $3.7 billion. And I think to your point with the tax reform and as Phebe alluded to that increases net income and by like amount increases free cash flow. So I don't think tax reform necessarily has -- have there no tax reform, didn\u2019t have any impact on our free cash conversion rate. What it does provide us is additional free cash flow that we can then deploy. And as Phebe mentioned, we have opportunities including in our shipyards as well as additional R&D and product development opportunities across the business to invest in the growth of the company, and that is something we intend to continue to do. So between those opportunities that will notch up or down over the course of the year and beyond as well as, as I alluded to the opportunity to perhaps take advantage of the tax reform to fund a little bit more into our pension plan. The free cash flow conversion could end up approaching a 100%, if not a 100%, we continue to target that range, but call it still in the 90s, we well exceeded a 100% in 2017 even beyond our original expectations, but we are back structurally in that range. And so I think that\u2019s how need to think of it. But we will probably focus more on operating cash flow as a number that\u2019s more directly targetable because some of those other levers will move up and down, CapEx, R&D, and so on to support the growth of the business and they could move the cash conversion rate from the mid 90s to the 100% range depending on where those ultimately end up, all opportunities for growth in the business. Samuel Pearlstein : But you -- I mean, you mentioned the $1.7 billion being spent at EB. And just -- what is the absolute level of CapEx we should expect in 2018? Jason W. Aiken: So, we typically target around 2% of sales. We\u2019ve come in a little lower than that in the past, so I'd expect to see us toward the higher end of that this year and in terms I think you asked a question about how does that plan over time. Some of that is -- its still in play. It's a longer term plan, but I think you will see it come up a little bit over the next few years and then back down as we go through that facility master plan. Samuel Pearlstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Douglas Harned : When you -- Phebe, when you talked about the guidance for this year and also the five-year guidance, how do you -- how are you thinking about the budget situation? In other words, the continuing resolution, we are in the fourth one now. It's not completely clear where this is going to go. Where do you see -- you mentioned IS&T before, but where do you see the biggest issues in your portfolio if we have a further extension of CRs and how have you dealt with this in your guidance short and long-term? Phebe N. Novakovic: So the budget have been very supportive of our program of records and our new programs. And I haven't seen any surprises there. Typically, we can cover a relatively short-term CR rather wholesomely and this year was a little bit different, and I can get into that if you wish. But what we've done is appropriately hedged our guidance with some expectations around varying length of the CR. So we will be and I believe better shape, and we\u2019re comfortable that we're in better shape this year with an extended CR than we were last year. Just to give you a little bit of color what happened last year, in particular with IS&T, which -- let's talk about the short cycle businesses tend to be more affected by a CR, but typically we can cover that. In '17, we had a couple of other things happen. And let me restate that or reinforce that the vast preponderance of the '17 revenues that we didn\u2019t get in '17 and moved into '18, but in addition to the CR, we had a number of new Army startups which had a disproportionate effect on the impact in both GDIT and Mission Systems. You may also recall that the Army stopped funding WIN-T and some other related comms programs until they completed their network and battlefield review. So that drove a couple of months of revenue from 2017 to 2018. And then we had a new administration with some unanticipated civil agency cuts that we had not forecasted and -- but that's been addressed by our customers in Fed civ as they modified their plans. So I think our ability to manage a CR is significantly better this year because I don't see any of those other factors contributing to perturbation in the IS&T sales. Douglas Harned : And presumably also in your outlook you\u2019ve got like Combat for example, you\u2019ve got a lot of international in there as well. I'm assuming that\u2019s a big -- that\u2019s an important part of that growth rate? Phebe N. Novakovic: It is, but if the -- don\u2019t underestimate the increase and modernization funding coming from the Army, that becomes an increasingly large component of our backlog throughout our planning period. Douglas Harned : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. Peter Skibitski : Yes. Phebe -- first of all, good morning, Phebe and Jason and Howard. Phebe, we\u2019ve had the new National Defense Strategy released last week and there's a lot of strategy shift, I think, more so to pure [ph] conflict and various areas of modernization needed. How do you think GD's capabilities matchup with that new strategy given -- at some point, I think, money will follow the strategy? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think very well. I have long said that I like the positioning of our platform, defense platform businesses because they tend to be somewhat countercyclical. In a hot war, the tactical forces received the preponderance of the funding and that was true certainly in the hot wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. When we wind down from active intense conflict than the strategic forces, which in our case is the Navy, tend to receive more funding. In this instance, what we have is a little bit of a combination of both that we need to grow the fleet for the obvious threats that we\u2019ve in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the Army needs to recapitalize based on -- it's had a number of years over a decade of the consumption of its material, but it needs to not only replace but upgrade that material and they put the money behind it. So I like, I think, we\u2019re well-balanced. I don\u2019t want any particular surprises in any of the studies that have come out recently and we had factored all of that into our thinking. Peter Skibitski : Just to go further on ground vehicles, Congress added an awful lot of money in its mark ups for fiscal '18. Is there maybe even some room for upside to your Combat forecast if that money comes through? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, let's put it this way. We are mindful that there can be an appetite for increasing particular program and ours have been very heavily supported, but -- particularly in the authorization process, but the appropriations have to follow. We're very comfortable that the programs that we have, our core programs of record in appropriation still are fully funded and frankly this is true across our portfolio. The more money that\u2019s available, the higher our revenue and opportunities can be. So I am comfortable with where we are in the moment on our projections given what we believe to be the likely outcome of at least the near-term budget cycle. Peter Skibitski : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein : Good morning. Phebe, you gave us some pretty good detail already on the sales backdrop for Gulfstream. Can you give us some more color on kind of who is buying these jets? Is it Fortune 500, is it across the board? Is it the U.S? Is it Europe? Is it Asia? And then a follow on to that would be what\u2019s your sense now on the J-Stars program? Because that could have an impact for a 550 production. Phebe N. Novakovic: So, order activity and frankly our backlog are heavily United States, Canada, and Europe, Far East, lesser extent Mid East. And in my case, some of that are backlog of what you need to think about it, we understand every single buyer in our backlog. We know them, they\u2019re sound financially. It's a sticky backlog and we have very few fleet customers. So as between -- so it is a very steady sturdy backlog, and the mix between public companies, private companies and individuals vary nearly about [indiscernible], and in any given quarter that can go up a little bit among those three categories, but no material difference in the last few years and what we are seeing in terms of a consist and geographical location of our customer base. J-Stars, I refer to you Northrop, because they\u2019re our prime. But the 550 will be in load a very low rate production for the foreseeable future and we will support the plan that Northrop has for us. Ronald Epstein : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead. Jonathan Raviv : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just to slightly follow-up on that capital allocation question. Just can you talk, Phebe and Jason a little bit more about the M&A outlook? You brought up some of the acquisition activity you had in 2017, any kind of shift in the market that you\u2019re detecting heading into 2018 and where you might be interested and to what extent from a bite-size perspective? Phebe N. Novakovic: We never comment on the environment for acquisitions. So I think I'll pass on that. You have another question? Jonathan Raviv : Sure. I appreciate that. When it comes to the CapEx plans that -- at your shipyards, how do you think about the returns on that CapEx? I mean, is that associated with client that you know are in place that the Navy is going to be able to afford or is there a little bit of assumption or intention that improving the shipyards will help the Navy for their larger shipbuilding plan? Phebe N. Novakovic: Look, we have always been very disciplined about our capital deployment and you can expect in this instance that we have planned our investments as close in time to the returns as possible. The Navy understands that. There are contractual provisions in all of our contracts that provide for harmonizing across to better optimize the investment with the returns. We are not speculative of the nation needs to fund the submarine force in particular. And our investments are twofold. One, they clearly make us more efficient, but it also helps the affordability for the Navy. So it's a win-win for both us and the Navy and we\u2019re in very close contact and have been completely aligned with the Navy with respect to the quantum and the timing of our investments and we fully understand the need for a reasonable return. Jonathan Raviv : Got it. Thanks for the second swing at the ball there. Operator : The next question will be from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, Phebe, Jason, Howard. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Jason W. Aiken: Good morning. Carter Copeland : Phebe, just a quick clarification on a comment you made earlier and then -- just a question on demand. But the initial production lot on new programs comment that you made before, if you can just clarify what is the size of a typical initial early production lot for new airplane? And then just with respect to the demand outlook and I know you kind of hinted at this with the industry-wide comment on expanding orders or -- I don\u2019t want to get the words wrong here, across the industry, but when you look at the plan that you laid out through 2021, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the underpinnings are there and if there's any expectation that the tax reform has a material impact on buying decision, I realize we're only a couple of weeks into the year, but any chance you can help us understand how to quantify what those sorts of impacts might be or what you expect or where you may have been conservative, anything there would be helpful. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic: So -- well, let me just say one thing here about tax reform. It can't hurt, right. So \u2026 Carter Copeland : Absolutely. Phebe N. Novakovic: So we will see how that plays out, but it frankly didn't factor into our projections. The demand -- we based our plan on the demand that we see about the -- what I\u2019ve called now for many, many quarters, a robust pipeline. The pipeline remains robust and we are a believer because history actually supports this view and experience support this view that new product generates additional incremental demand. We've got new product coming out. So I\u2019m comfortable that our demand projections that\u2019s been a manifest in our deliveries are reasonable. And let me -- so I think -- I hope that gives you a little bit of color, but let me have Jason address the lot. Jason W. Aiken: Sure. And yes -- and without getting into the specifics of our inventory numbering system, suffice it to say, a lot of aircraft at Gulfstream we would burn through within a year in terms of delivery. So when you think about the 500 or any airplane that\u2019s entering into service, there's going to be a natural production ramp. And so we won't quite get through the first full lot in this year, but there will be a handful of unit that will deliver in the early part of next year. So we'll be through that first production lot by early next year. Carter Copeland : So we\u2019re talking not a handful, but a dozen or dozen something like that? Jason W. Aiken: Exactly. Its more than a handful. Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks for the color. Howard A. Rubel: And thank you Carter, and we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that will be from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. If you could to the extent possible, Phebe, talk about many incremental interest you maybe saw with the effective push out of Falcon 5X and maybe a broader question around that, so it's a two part question. How often do you see biz jet customers in, generally, switching brands? Does most competition come from competitors or is it really yourselves as always kind of competing against each other with new product offering? How often do you see switching broadly speaking? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, historically and this is historically customers have been pretty loyal to their particular brand. I think over the last three, four, five years, we\u2019ve seen some -- we\u2019ve seen changes in that prior behavior and we have gained share. We have -- we now have our customers in our backlog and are delivering airplanes to customers that were in other peoples, other airplane manufacturers, historical customer set. So I don't really think about it and I don't really know how much is from any particular -- how much of our incremental increases in our order book and in our backlog has been the result of others, but frankly we're the only ones really out there in the moment with a lot of new airplanes. We got the 650, we got the 500 and 600 coming right in behind it and then frankly the 280. So that I believe is the single largest reason for the increase in our backlog and more importantly in our orders and deliveries in the moment. Hunter Keay : So would you say loyalty is more a function of -- sort of capabilities or do you sometime see that opportunity to take share, if there are, say, manufacturing or production delays with some of your competitors? Thanks so much. Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I\u2019m really not going to talk about our strategy. I don\u2019t worry too much about what the others are doing. I think we just have to focus on doing what we do well and what we do well is we\u2019re the low-cost, high quality producer across all of our fleet of airplanes and we have also funded and are executing a robust pipeline -- a robust R&D program that has allowed us to bring in consistently new product. I focus on that. I believe that is what ultimately drive success and that is what you\u2019re seeing in the Gulfstream performance. Howard A. Rubel: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Again, thanks for your time. You may disconnect. Operator : Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, we will ask you to disconnect your lines.",

Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Howard, and good morning. I intend to keep my remarks on performance in the quarter somewhat brief since the results are relatively straightforward, pretty solid, and the comparisons generally attractive. I will, however, spend more time providing color around the business segments, and IS&T and Aerospace in particular. For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $2.65 on revenue somewhat in excess of $7.5 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion, and net earnings of $799 million. All of the numbers that I'm about to give you with reference to the first quarter 2017 for comparison purposes are restated for the adoption of accounting standard update 2017-07 with respect to the presentation of retirement benefit costs. So compared to the first quarter of 2017, revenue was up $94 million or 1.3%, and operating earnings were down $38 million or 3.6% over the prior year's quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was at 13.4%. It was very good but did not compare favorably to last year's stellar first quarter of 14.1%. On the other hand, net earnings at $799 million were up $36 million, or 4.7%, on the strength of a lower provision for income taxes. EPS of $2.65 was $0.17 or 6.9% better than the year-ago quarter and $0.15 better than consensus. We estimate that about half of that $0.15 beat was from operations in the form of higher than expected operating margin, and the remainder came from a lower than expected tax rate. Now let me provide some additional granularity for you. Our three Defense segments posted very strong revenue growth of $343 million or 6.4% over the year-ago quarter. The same was true with respect to earnings. The Defense segment's earnings grew $53 million or 8.8%. Each of the Defense groups grew both revenue and earnings over the year-ago period, demonstrating what we believe will be strong growth in our defense businesses across the board. This leads quite naturally to a discussion of the Aerospace group. Revenue in the quarter was $1.82 billion and earnings were $346 million. Aerospace revenue was down $249 million or 12%, and earnings were down $93 million or 21.2% on a 220 basis point contraction in margin. These earnings were consistent with our guidance and pretty much as anticipated by consensus. It would appear that Aerospace was somewhat lower on revenue but higher on earnings than consensus. In fact, we had planned to deliver two more aircraft in the quarter, a special mission G550 and a G280. They were ready and scheduled for delivery in the quarter, but were delayed for the convenience of the customer. The G280 delivered during the first week of April. The G550 will deliver in May to allow additional customer changes. If we had managed those deliveries as planned, we would have been consistent with or slightly ahead of revenue expectations. It was kind of difficult to work deliveries during Easter week. The same could be said for completing orders during that week. Nevertheless, Aerospace is right on plan for earnings and modestly behind on revenue, which will be caught up. It was a simple timing problem on two deliveries. It is also well to remember that our plan for revenue is back-end loaded with deliveries of G500 in the second half. Orders for the group were reasonably typical of a first quarter. In the quarter, the net orders were about $1.4 billion, and the dollar-based book-to-bill was 0.8-to-1. This is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter of 2013 through 2017. The Aerospace average bookings for the first quarter over the last five years were $1.4 billion, a book-to-bill of about 0.7. So it was a quarter with strong sales pipeline replenishment. It was part of the normal cycle after a very strong fourth quarter. I should also note that the activity has been good in April, with evidence of strong interest in North America and a growing opportunity set in Europe. The reports from our people who attended the Asian Business Aviation Air Show were that the talk of Chinese tariffs on business jets was more of a media discussion. It has not caused any deal discussions to stop. In fact, it may have stimulated some near-term activity. The Chinese customers believe that the question of tariffs will be resolved. Other than that note of caution, we are optimistic about the market and our sales activity. With respect to product development, our G500 continues to mature, moving closer to final certification this summer and entry into service only a few months after the original EIS we announced four years ago. As you know, we have pursued simultaneous FAA and EASA certification requirements. We have now completed key supplier component-level tests, which expanded the program as we developed configurations to meet regulatory requirements. This work is now behind us. This work coupled with the G500 and G600 range enhancement testing has added to our total program time, but produced outstanding results. We have recently completed tests for flights into known icing and high field elevation. We have begun the last phase of our flight testing, known as function and reliability testing. The 300-hour function and reliability testing will complete the flying portion of the program. The program will then shift to final document approval by the FAA. To date, we have submitted 98% of the final certification documents to the FAA for review. We expect certification in June or July. We will begin pilot training with FlightSafety in August and commence deliveries later this year. We remain on plan to meet our 2018 G500 planned customer deliveries. This new technology aircraft with active control sidesticks, touchscreen displays, and fly-by-wire continues to exceed our expectations. As we progress closer to G500 certification, our testing has logged more than 4,000 hours. The G600 is benefiting from all of these efforts and will wrap up its certification in the second half of 2018. We will begin deliveries of the G600 in 2019. Our service business at Gulfstream remains strong, with very nice growth in the quarter and strong margins. Second quarter loading is solid. We expect solid performance for the year in this business, which is in excess of $1 billion in annual revenue. We look forward to concluding the recently announced Hawker Pacific acquisition for Jet Aviation. It's a very strategic acquisition for Jet and simultaneously helpful to Gulfstream in places where it does not have standalone Gulfstream support facilities. Now let me turn to the Defense side of the business, starting with Combat Systems. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, sales at $1.44 billion were up $153 million or 11.9%, and operating earnings of $224 million were up $19 million or 9.3%. There was strong performance across the board in each one of the three businesses within this group. Sequentially, revenue was down $308 million, but operating earnings were down only $36 million on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is a particularly difficult comparison on a revenue basis. This group always has a very strong fourth quarter, largely related to contract deliveries at the end of the year. With respect to the demand environment, the U.S. Army continues to fund readiness, which includes significant upgrades to our major weapon platforms, the Stryker and the Abrams main battle tank. We are also seeing increases in funding for our munitions products, both domestically and internationally. Internationally, our European-based business continues to have nice order activity throughout Europe and into parts of Africa. Given Combat's large backlog, they still had nice order activity in the quarter of 1-to-1. Funded backlog of $17.1 billion was down only $32 million against the fourth quarter of 2017 and $68 million against the year-ago quarter, all in all, extremely strong operating performance once again at Combat Systems. Turning to IS&T, this is going to be the last quarter we report to you in this particular format. I will do so here, give you some numbers for the individual companies that make up the group, and then ask Jason to make some forward-looking statements that we think will be of assistance to you. IS&T had revenue of $2.24 billion. That is $90 million or 4.2% more than the year-ago quarter. Earnings followed suit. Operating earnings of $247 million were $11 million or 4.7% better than the year-ago quarter. The operating margin of 11% was the same in both quarters. Book-to-bill was once again about 1-to-1. These results were very consistent with consensus. IS&T total backlog has remained relatively constant over the past year. At $8.8 billion, it is up $94 million against the year-ago quarter and down $60 million sequentially. Funded backlog at $6.74 billion is up $57 million against the year-ago quarter and sequentially, so a pretty good start to the year from a new business perspective. Now to help get everybody on the same page, let me break down the revenue, operating earnings, and operating margins in the quarter for each of the two businesses that made up IS&T, which will be reported separately going forward. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.1 billion, operating earnings of $134 million, and an operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. GDIT had revenue of $1.14 billion, operating earnings of $99 million, and our operating margin of 8.7% in the quarter. At this point, I'd like to turn to Jason to interject some comments about dividing the guidance we had given you in January for IS&T into each of the businesses, and then comment on the impact of CSRA on GDIT for the year. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: As Phebe discussed, starting in the second quarter, we'll report the two IS&T businesses, Mission Systems and GDIT, separately. To give you a sense of how to think about that, let me start with how those businesses comprise the original guidance we gave you for IS&T for the year. For the full year, we expected IS&T revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. Mission Systems represents slightly more than half of those revenues, between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, while GDIT is approximately $4.5 billion of that forecast. From a margin perspective, you can think about Mission Systems in the 13% to 14% range and GDIT in the high single-digit range, around 8%. So with that as a baseline, how does CSRA impact GDIT for the year? We closed the transaction on April 3, so we'll have three quarters of the year with the combined company. We expect that to add approximately $3.6 billion in sales for the year. The impact of the combined GDIT margins and the company's bottom line EPS will depend on the outcome of our purchase price allocation to intangible assets and the resulting amortization, which we'll have a better sense of this quarter and report to you on our second quarter call. But at a macro level, we expect that after the one-time charge associated with the cost to compete this transaction, which will be approximately $80 million and be taken as a discrete item in the second quarter, CSRA will be breakeven to slightly accretive to our GAAP earnings per-share starting in the third quarter. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. Finally, let's turn to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.03 billion was up $100 million or 5.2% against the year-ago quarter. Importantly, revenue was up in each of the three shipyards. Earnings were $184 million, a $23 million or 14.3% increase against the first quarter 2017. Just like the revenue story, earnings were up in all three shipyards. The earnings performance was driven by a 9% operating margin, a 70 basis point improvement over first quarter 2017. Sequentially, revenue was down $26 million or 1.3%, but earnings were up $17 million, a strong 10.2% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margin. The backlog story here is very strong. Total backlog at $23.8 billion is down $451 million sequentially, but funded backlog is up over $2.4 billion. This is on the strength of $1.6 billion in orders in the quarter. Electric Boat is continuing to work on its 27th Virginia-class submarine, and we are deep into the final engineering phase on the Columbia ballistic-missile submarine. We began material purchases early this year to support construction on the first ship for Columbia, forecast to begin full construction in 2020. Bath is working down its learning curve on the restart DDG-51s and delivered the second DDG-1000 yesterday. The last of the three DDG-1000s delivers in 2020. NASSCO continues its strong performance on each of its class of Navy and commercial ships. So the company is off to a very good start to the year, somewhat ahead of our expectations. The first quarter should be received as a constructive building block to a good year. We do not as a practice change guidance of the end of the first quarter. It is our practice to give you a full review of our expectations at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we are a bit ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance was based. As always, we will work to consolidate our improvement and strive to continue to improve our results. I'd now like to turn the call back to Jason for additional remarks about taxes, pension, and cash. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Phebe, and good morning. First, a couple points on the income statement, starting with interest expense. Net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to the slightly higher interest rate on the debt we refinanced late last year. You'll note we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding in addition to the $4 billion of fixed-rate notes we had at the end of the year. That CP was drawn in anticipation of the CSRA acquisition. We had other expense in the quarter of $21 million compared with $11 million in the first quarter of last year. This reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard that Phebe alluded to, ASU 2017-07, which requires us to report the non-service cost portion of our pension expense in other income and expense. That's what you see reflected in the quarter, and the 2017 numbers have been adjusted for a comparable reporting. This new rule is nothing more than a modification to the geography of our pension income and expense on the income statement, no impact to the aggregate amount of income or expense. One more point on the subject of pensions, we noted on our fourth quarter earnings call that we were considering making additional pension contributions this year in light of the benefits afforded by the recent tax reform. After finalizing this analysis, we are now planning to make approximately $550 million in pension contributions this year, up from our original plan of $300 million. That $250 million increase will, of course, impact our operating cash forecast, which I'll touch on in just a minute. But before I go there, one more point on the income statement, our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter. While our full-year tax rate guidance was 19%, the lower first quarter rate was anticipated in that guidance based on the timing of divesting of our restricted stock and the associated tax benefit. So the lower rate in the quarter is consistent with our full-year tax rate forecast, which remains unchanged at 19%. Of course, with the lower first quarter rate, you can impute a slightly higher than 19% rate for the balance of the year to end up with 19% for the full year. On the capital deployment front, we paid $250 million in dividends and spent just shy of $270 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock in the quarter. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying our remaining free cash flow to pay down our short-term borrowings used to acquire CSRA. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.3 billion on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $2.1 billion, including the $2.5 billion of commercial paper I mentioned earlier. On the subject of cash, our operating activities used cash of roughly $500 million in the quarter. This reflects the timing of payments from customers and two suppliers and doesn't affect our full-year outlook for cash from operations, which remains unchanged but for the additional pension contributions I discussed earlier, and of course, the addition of CSRA, which we'll give you more granular sense of when we update our full-year guidance in July. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Chad, could you just remind participants how to enter the queue, please? Operator : Certainly. The first question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey, good morning, all. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Just a quick question on the Aerospace margins in the quarter. Just given the work you've got going on and a little bit of concurrency (00:21:10) on the G500, is there anything we should note in terms of additional R&D expense or intra-period expense that we should consider there? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, so the margins in the quarter were driven by a couple of things, productivity in our large cabins. We had improved margin in our services due to mix at Gulfstream, and net R&D was down somewhat sequentially from fourth quarter of 2017. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So the CSRA contribution of about $3.6 billion, it looks like that would be down a bit versus what CSRA did in the comparable period, the three-quarter period in the prior year. And they've been guiding to organic growth, plus they have a couple small deals in there. Can you just share what you're seeing in that business? Am I correct that that would be a little bit of a year-over-year revenue decline for CSRA? Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: There are actually a couple of moving parts in the there. First, we do have, and I believe we've discussed before a little bit of OCI business that we've got to divest of, and we're in the process of making that happen now. So that will take a little bit out of the top line number you're referring to. The other element of it is, of course, CSRA was on a fiscal year ending March 31. So if you look at the pattern of their revenue, it was at its peak in their fourth quarter. So when we talked about the first full year of guidance and they talked about their next year's guidance, that went the nine months of this year that we'll have them plus the first quarter of next year. So when you normalize for that seasonality in their revenue curve, the numbers we're projecting are right on with the previous estimates you heard from them. Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will be from David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Phebe, I wanted to ask you about the fiscal 2018 budget. It looks like all of your key programs were well funded, particularly on the Combat Systems side. Can you talk about the upside that you guys saw in the budget relative to what you were thinking and what that might mean for your longer-term forecast for Combat because I don't think you had baked in there much for U.S. Army recapitalization? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Actually, given that we're so close to our customer, we had anticipated their funding increases, both in the readiness counts, which we see in our OTS munitions line, and then upgrades to our major platforms, Stryker and Abrams. So there was no particular surprise in 2018 beyond what we had anticipated. We get insight into the budget deliberations relatively early on and had planned accordingly. So Stryker and Abrams in particular are doing quite well, and we're nicely funded in the budget and consistent with what we anticipated, so no real surprises, which is exactly what you want. Operator : The next question will be from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thank you so much. So, Phebe, in the past, you've talked about the problems with the G650 doing the completions before cert and all the problems that caused. And you said you wouldn't start completions until you receive the cert. What does that imply for the deliveries in the remainder of the year? And I assume that means mid to late fourth quarter because it takes, what, four to six months for initial completions. And secondly, now that you're approaching the cert, are we likely to see the orders pick up as you can take customers flying with you? Thanks so much. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the G650 was a different case. We had built a fair number of green airplanes and had considerable FAA regulatory changes that we had to make. That pattern has not repeated here. This was a very mature program. Having run through all of our tests, frankly, the changes that we've made to the original aircraft have all been manageable. So with respect to timing, where in the G650 we had a delay from cert to delivery, we don't expect that in this case. We'll be ready to go with only some minor changes and very manageable on the G500s that we've got in service and, frankly, that we'll deliver. Frankly, our order activity has been quite nice. We're well over 50 orders on the G500 and close to that on the G600. So our deliveries will be backward-loaded, but really think the second half, not the fourth quarter. They will come pretty quickly coming off the line, all right? Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Phebe, can you update deliveries for the year at Gulfstream? Now you had been saying you would deliver a few less G650s. But given that the G500 is going to deliver a little bit later, are we going to still see somewhat less G650s or not as much? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We're not changing in the midst of our build plan at all. We have exactly the same number of G650s that we had anticipated. We're not moving off of our deliveries. We'll be right in that range, maybe one or two, depending on customer preferences. The G500, the couple of month delay we've had in certification from our original estimate has really had no \u2013 zero impact on our deliveries forecast for 2018. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next up is Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Phebe, a question just I guess sticking on Gulfstream. Maybe you could just update us. You highlighted that you've had exactly what you planned in terms of order activity for the first quarter, and you had a really strong fourth quarter. But maybe we're four or five months into this tax reform. Are you seeing any differences between domestic and international? Maybe just give us some color on what you're seeing on end demand. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the demand in Gulfstream is quite nice, and I think you quite accurately posited that tax reform has certainly helped. We have very strong order activity in North America and increasingly strong in Europe, by the way. But we attribute our North American order activity to a number of factors, our long-term customers replenishing their fleet as well as the incremental benefit to cash flow from tax reform; so frankly, all salutary impact for us. Operator : The next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you talk a little bit about free cash flow? I know some of it is timing. But it seems like across the board, whether it's unbilled, receivables, payables, inventory, cash flow seemed weak. How much was the G500 delay in there? And I know you mentioned the higher pension. If we ex the higher pension, could you still get to the 100% conversion? And lastly, if you can talk about how CSRA impacts cash, that would be helpful. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. So I think the bottom line is with respect to the cash in the quarter, as you pointed out, it's a variety of the working capital accounts, but it really is nothing more than timing. It's payments from customers and payments to suppliers that, frankly, was largely profiled for the quarter. We anticipated a softer first quarter this year within the forecast we originally gave you. Part of that is the continued build at Gulfstream. But again, nothing outsized or outside of our original plans. So all of that is par for the course and everything we expected in the first three months of the year. We did have a billing system implementation in a business unit that had caused a catch-up, and that has already been caught up in the month of April, so we're back on track there. So I feel very good about the cash forecast we gave you. As it relates to pension contributions, we really don't think about it in this point in terms of free cash flow conversion as a percent of net income. Because as we talked about, that's a metric. That 100% number is a metric that it's interesting to talk about. But in a period of growth and investment in the company, I think it's more constructive to talk about the strength of our operating cash conversion and then how we're going to deploy operating cash for the growth of the company. So as I said, everything remains consistent with our original plan from an operating cash generation standpoint. CSRA will contribute nicely to that. There's a number of factors that obviously have to be finalized. We've had that business now closed for about three weeks, so we're still closing the books on their fiscal 2018 and working out the finer details of the implications of that for the year. But I think suffice it to say right now, the cash accretion we anticipate from CSRA is looking to be better than what we modeled in our valuation and deal forecast when we came through due diligence. So I feel bullish about the contribution they'll make for us this year. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Remember, one of our rationales for both liking IT services and buying CSRA is that IT services companies have very strong cash conversion, and CSRA will add nicely to it. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A quick question for you. It seems like some of your suppliers on the G500 program have struggled to meet the targets that you need for delivery for you guys. Could you expand at all on what has been the difficulty in the supply chain? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: We've had very few issues with any of our key suppliers. I will not discuss our suppliers' supply chain. I think you got some color on that from the UTC call yesterday, but our suppliers have done a good job managing their supply chain and will continue to do that. So frankly, our supply chain is geared up nicely to support our expected deliveries on our new airplanes as well as continue to perform on our existing air fleet. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So you're comfortable from here forward that everything is stable? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, we are. We're going to enter into service, as I told you, on the G500, and the G600 to follow not long thereafter, and the supply chain supports that. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, Phebe, you mentioned Bath briefly in your prepared remarks, and you noted some of the milestones on the destroyers up there and some progress on the learning curve. But recently, the Navy still seems to suggest that this is your one yard with operational upside. So I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on how the learning curve progresses from here and how the margins might benefit from that, especially as you continue to mature on the Flight III DDG-51. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. So the margin performance on the DDG-1000 program has been quite nice, with excellent ship-over-ship learning. Our performance on the restart, starting with the DDG-116, has proceeded according to our plan, and we are continuing to see learning and improvements on hull-over-hull. And we have a number of Flight IIAs still in the queue. Our work on the Flight III, which we got appropriated and contracted with us late last year, continues to go very well. We're in detailed design and the early stages of the manufacturing work papers. And again, our learning on the hull continues nicely apace. So that shipyard has had some issues, which we've talked about in the past. But we are comfortable that is largely behind us, and we're going to continue to do well as we go forward on what are really legacy platforms for us after we got that line restarted from a dead stop. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is there any way to quantify what margins would look like in Marine once that yard is back where you want it? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: That's going to be a complicated question because you've got an increased mix in Columbia, which will be cost-plus through the duration of our plan period and then into the next as we move from our engineering and detailed design into the early phases of construction and full weight (36:05) construction. So our margins are going to bop around, and I'd say anywhere between the 8% and 10% on any given quarter, depending on the mix of Columbia. It's a cost-plus work in the middle of it. So that rather dwarfs incremental improvement. That said, we expect our shipyards to get better quarter after quarter, and Bath is doing precisely that. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Phebe, can you talk more about Aerospace's continued drive into the biz jet aftermarket? I think you announced a bunch of service center expansions in Savannah and Appleton, Van Nuys, either during the quarter of after, and then of course, the Hawker deal. Just wondering, is this you guys just trying to get more access to your own jets, or does the market growth seem really strong? And number two, are these moves dilutive or accretive to overall Aerospace margins? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: You mean the service business in general? Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Right. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay, so look, as our fleet has grown and flying hours have increased, it is incumbent upon us to increase our services to our customers. Our customers expect Gulfstream service and the excellence implied with Gulfstream service, and we're delivering it. So we anticipate continued growth in that market as our fleet increases. And frankly, while on any given quarter, the service margins \u2013 let's just talk about Gulfstream for a second \u2013 may be slightly dilutive to new airplane margins, they are very fulsome. And the margins at service really depend on a number of things, the loading at the service centers and the mix. So it tends to move around a fair amount, but we really like this business. And it's key to continuing to satisfy our customer needs. So we're going to expand it and expand it accordingly. With respect to Jet Aviation, we have added service capacity, again to support Gulfstream's expanded footprint, particularly outside the United States, where Gulfstream doesn't have an existing capability. So in the case of the Hawker acquisition, we added six FBOs, 14 maintenance facilities, and over 400,000 square feet of hangar space. So again, this is all in an attempt to support Gulfstream sales as our fleet increases, and I think we're doing that quite nicely and quite deliberatively. By the way, this aircraft services business is a relatively low-risk business. And if you think about Jet Aviation, I like our service business because it is low risk and very nice margins and great cash flow, so all good from that perspective. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I'm interested now that we're getting close to the G500 and then the G600 coming out. When you look over the next few years where you see G650 demand going, deliveries going, how do you see that trending? You've got the Global 7000 coming out. You've got your G600. Do you see either of those as having an effect on your rate for the G650? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: In neither instance. Look, I don't pay much attention to other people's airplanes, but the G650 sales have been very fulsome. We continue to anticipate that that airplane will sell. It has an important market that frankly can't be satisfied by any other airplane in terms of speed and range and the success of that platform. And the G600 is in a completely different market space. So we think as we designed these airplanes and thought about the replacement of our legacy G450 and G550, each one of these airplanes fits a very different kind of mission. So we think this is all additive and not an issue for the G650. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Do you see the trend line here as \u2013 do you see it as being a pretty stable delivery outlook over the next few years then for the G650? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I do. Recall, however, that we were going to, as we feathered in G650 deliveries to cover the decrease in the G450 and the elimination of the G450 line and then low rate production on the G550, we will begin to take a few out over the next few years on a general float, consistent with what we told you I think at your conference two years ago. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, everyone. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Phebe, actually if I could just follow up on that last question from Doug, recognizing that you want to focus on your own portfolio and not on others, as you mentioned, the Global 7000 is pretty significant competitor... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: In your opinion. That is a hypothesis. It remains to be seen. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's really my question. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Frankly, I don't look at anybody else's airplanes because it's our business to sell our airplane into our market, and we've been very successful at that. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Right, so that's really my question. Is it a competitive aircraft? Certainly just looking high level at specification and price range, it looks that way. And so I was hoping you could elaborate on what the differences are, what your customers say the differences are that allow it to drive them to actually be more different than they can appear on the surface. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Wow, you have an airplane that has been in service now since 2012. That's five years. We have 400 in service now, and nobody else is a competitor airplane. And it remains to be seen whether the Global 7000 is an issue at all for Gulfstream, but we have not lost a single sale to date to the Global 7000. So again, I think you all can worry about that to your hearts' content. But the fact of the matter is this is a very, very effective airplane with a capability set in range and speed that has proven unequal. So we worry about what we control and what we see, so all good for the G650. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: All right, operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Sure. And that question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe just a quick few partly related to the CSRA deal. Can you talk a little bit about the JEDI [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure] contract and potentially what that means for CSRA and how CSRA may or may not be involved? And then, Jason, can you talk about what the ongoing interest expense is going to be once the deal is done? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Sure. CSRA won the milCloud contract and anticipates teaming with a number of our traditional teammates as we look at JEDI. But milCloud will have to be an important part of whatever happens with conversion of the overarching DOD network. So we're comfortable where we are. We've got strong partnerships in place from our folks who live in the IT services business today and some non-traditional. By the way, the \"non-traditional\" guys have been with us for years, so I see this as well within our normal experience set. But we'll see, we'll see as it all comes out. I think the contract is due out sometime in the next couple of months, and we'll see how all that shakes out. Jason W. Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: And as it relates to your question on interest expense, that's one of the moving parts that we have to pin down. We obviously haven't gone to the market for that yet. That will occur next month. And once we do that, that will be part of the factors that will allow us to give you a more granular sense of the bottom-line impact of the deal. Right now, what we're seeing in terms of our pulse of the market and the rates we're seeing out there, it's all consistent and well within the parameters we established when we priced the deal. So we're very comfortable with where that is right now. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Operator, with that, we'll end the call. Thank you all very much for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you again.",

Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risk and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. As you can discern from our more expansive press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.19 billion and net earnings of $786 million. We reported EPS of $2.62 per diluted share $0.17 a share better than the year ago quarter and $0.12 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter revenue of $9.19 billion was up $1.51 billion or 19.7%. Of this number, approximately 3% represents organic revenue growth with the remainder coming from the acquisition of CSRA. Net earnings of $786 million were up $37 million or 4.9% on the strength of a $21 million improvement in operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate offset in part by higher interest expense. This was particularly impressive given the $70 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to the acquisition of CSRA but a little more on that from Jason in a minute. Sequentially, the story is much the same. Revenue was up $1.65 billion or 21.9% and operating earnings were up $80 million or 7.9% on the lower operating margins attributable to the $45 million of the $70 million one-time costs associated with the acquisition of CSRA reported as corporate operating earnings. The other $25 million was reported in other expense. Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. Revenue was up $1.61 billion or 10.6% against the first half of 2017 for the same reasons, both the acquisition of CSRA and organic growth. On the other hand, operating earnings were down $17 million burdened by the aforementioned $45 million of cost in connection with the CSRA acquisition and increased amortization. Earnings from continuing operations were up $73 million, a 4.8% increase. EPS was $0.33 better, a 6.7% increase. In short, we had a very good second quarter and first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal plan and external expectations. The CSRA acquisition performed as expected. Impressively, the acquisition would have been accretive in the quarter absent the onetime period of costs associated with it. These onetime period of costs burdened EPS by $0.20 per share in the quarter. The acquisition will be accretive to EPS in the second half mostly in the fourth quarter. And again, Jason will give you a little bit more color on this in a moment. Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half and then I'll ask Jason for some comments on the CSRA acquisition cash, backlog, and taxes, before I conclude with some comments on the outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in all important respects. Revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $386 million were $183 million and $35 million lower respectively, but consistent with our outlook and the production plan for the year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to an impressive 20.4%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $70 million and operating earnings were up $40 million on a 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. We enjoyed brisk order activity in the quarter. The dollar-based book-to-bill was a strong 1.3 to 1. This brings the book-to-bill to 1 to 1 for the first half and for the last 12 calendar months as well. One year ago at the end of the second quarter, the Aerospace funded backlog was $12.12 billion. At the end of this quarter, it was $12.19 billion. Total backlog is up from $12.24 billion to $12.34 billion. Total estimated contract value is up $14.15 billion to $14.63 billion. So as you can see, we have had very good order performance for a full year now. The 650 and 650ER led the way in the quarter. The interest in all of our products remains quite good. The demand signals in North America are very good and growing in Europe as well. We are comfortable with the anticipated third quarter orders based on early orders, contract discussions and our pipeline. In short, we expect a good third quarter and second half from an order perspective. Book-to-bill should be 1 to 1 or better in the second half better than that in the third quarter and lower in the fourth quarter because of higher anticipated deliveries. However, we could do a bit better in the fourth quarter. As you know, the G500 was certified on July 20. This now paves the way for pilot training in the third quarter and deliveries commencing early fourth quarter with a few possibly in Q3. G600 flying continues to go well. We look forward to certification in the fourth quarter of this year. In May, we also closed the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. It adds to Jet's global footprint, demonstrating a willingness to invest in support of our customers in locations convenient to them. This business will be part of a Jet Aviation-Gulfstream strategy to support a joint service effort outside of the United States. Let me now turn to the defense side of the house. At the outset, let me say that the collective revenue of the defense businesses was up 7.1% over the year ago quarter excluding the impact of CSRA. Turning to the individual segments, Combat Systems had a very good quarter as the relevant comparisons clearly indicate. Revenue of $1.53 billion was $120 million more than the second quarter last year, up 8.5%. Similarly, operating earnings were $236 million, up $11 million, or 5% over the second quarter of 2017. I should remind everybody that the second quarter of 2017 represented a 9% improvement over second quarter 2016 in revenue and almost 10% in operating earnings. So we have experienced strong quarter-over-quarter growth for two years now. On a sequential basis, the story is similar. Revenue was up $94 million or 6.5% and operating earnings were up $12 million or 5.4%. For the first half, revenue was up $273 million, slightly in excess of 10% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were up $30 million or 7%. Our U.S.-based programs continue to perform well with Abrams volumes up and nice growth in the ordnance and munitions portfolio. The Army continues to exploit the versatility of the Stryker with a $260 million contract in the quarter to upgrade the electronics, power and communications on the vehicle. This contract is part of the Army's plan to similarly upgrade all of their nine Stryker Brigades. We also received a $440 million order to upgrade Abrams tanks to the Version 3.0 configuration, which provides improved power, survivability and lethality. The continued monetization of our platforms in the coming years is, for the first time in a while, manifest in explicit program direction for the tank and the Stryker which puts us in good stead for continued growth. Our international programs continue to see nice growth as well. Work on the UK AJAX program is transitioning to production from engineering with peak production in 2021. We are obviously trending in the right direction at combat. It is a very nice growth story. With respect to the Marine segment, revenue of $2.17 billion was $89 million higher than Q2 a year ago. Operating earnings were up $17 million against the year ago quarter on a 40 basis point expansion in operating profit. Similar to Combat Systems, the 2017 quarter experienced nice growth in both revenue and earnings against the same quarter in 2016. So once again, two years of good growth. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $134 million and operating earnings were up $11 million at 6.6% and 6% respectively. For the first half, revenue of $4.2 billion was up $189 million or 4.7% against the first half of 2017. Operating earnings were also up by $40 million or 11.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin to 9%. Work on our submarine programs, the Virginia class construction and engineering on the Columbia ballistic missile submarine, continues to make good progress. We are building Virginia-class Block IV boats and have begun to purchase long lead material for the Block V. We expect the Block V contract to be awarded later this year. With respect to Bath, the challenges on the first DDG-1000 boat and the DDG-51 restart ships are largely behind us with nice performance from the DDG-1001 and 1002 and on the follow on DDG-51 ships. We expect a multi-year contract to be awarded later this year for the DDG-51 Flight III upgrade. Finally, surface repair at NASSCO had a slower start than anticipated this year but will ramp up in the second half. In all, Marine Systems has been a compelling growth story for us and will continue to be so for a long time to come. We are now reporting what was IS&T in two segments : first, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and second, Information Technology, one of the industry's largest providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and federal civilian agencies. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems had revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarter, an increase of $95 million or 9% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $153 million were steady against the second quarter last year as a result of a 120 basis point drop in operating margin due to program mix in the quarter. We expect that mix to improve in the second half. Mission Systems reports internally in three lines of business : ISR systems, communications, and platforms and sensors. Growth year-to-date for Mission Systems was primarily in ISR, in particular space payloads and encryption, and in communications. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $49 million and earnings were up $7 million. On a year-to-date basis, Mission Systems revenue was up $105 million or 4.9%. Once again, first half earnings were steady against the first half of last year. Mission Systems has been a good growth business for us and will continue to be so. It has enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 in 2016, 2017 and the first half of 2018. Information Technology reported revenue of $2.44 billion in the second quarter. CSRA's contribution in the quarter was $1.29 billion. The revenue of Legacy GDIT was up $96 million or 9.1% excluding CSRA against the year ago quarter. Operating earnings were $156 million with a $72 million contribution from CSRA, which includes $62 million of an amortization charge as a result of the transaction. Margin was 6.4% versus 8.3% the year ago quarter as a result of CSRA intangible asset amortization. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.58 billion, was up $1.4 billion. Importantly, revenue in the first half was up $176 million or 8.3% excluding the impact of CSRA. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up $80 million or 45.2%. Operating margins of 7.2% compares with the first half of last year of 8.4% consistent with the second quarter results. Our integration of CSRA into GDIT is going well and is ahead of our internal schedule. Our management team pulled from both businesses has gelled nicely. We are meeting cost synergy targets and are working to exceed this year's goal. The strength of GDIT post acquisition is in the experience of both GDIT and CSRA in developing cost effective solutions for its customers and leveraging this experience across multiple agencies. Both companies are excellent at transitioning old IT solutions to secure cloud-based solutions that are easier to operate and maintain. Together, we are even better. We expect this to be a competitive and powerful combination of talent and know how. So, in summary, in the quarter, General Dynamics accomplished a number of key strategic objectives and delivered solid operating results. We closed on the largest acquisition in GD's history, expanded Jet Aviation's service network in Australia and the Asia Pacific region, and grew earnings and backlog. I'll now turn the call over to Jason and then come back to you with our outlook for the rest of the year. Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with the income statement and, in particular, the areas that are impacted by the CSRA acquisition. First, as Phebe noted, are the onetime transition costs we incurred associated with the acquisition. A portion of these costs, largely related to change of control provisions, are reported in our operating earnings as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, while the balance, legal, accounting, and other advisory fees, is reported in other income and expense. In the quarter, we recognized $45 million of transaction costs in corporate operating earnings and $25 million in other expenses below the line for a total of $70 million in the quarter. You'll recall, we recognized $5 million of these one-time fees and other expenses in the first quarter and we anticipate the final payments in the third quarter to bring us to a total transaction cost of $80 million or $0.23 per share. Including these onetime charges, we expect corporate operating costs and the other below the line expenses to each be approximately $25 million for the year. Turning to net interest expense, we reported $103 million in the quarter, compared to $24 million in the second quarter of 2017. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $130 million versus $49 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $355 million versus our initial pre-acquisition January guidance of $115 million. Wrapping up the discussion of CSRA, the second quarter numbers include provisional amounts related to purchase accounting for CSRA. Although, not final, we believe we have good estimates of the acquired intangible assets and the related amortization expense. These estimates are very much in line with what we reported in our recent 8-K filing associated with this transaction, which are approximately $2 billion of intangible assets and a $190 million of amortization for the nine months of 2018. Moving on from CSRA, our effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter which is consistent with our full year outlook. You'll recall, our first quarter tax rate was somewhat lower due to the timing of benefits associated with equity compensation deductions so the rate for the first half of the year was 17.9%. That quite naturally implies a rate higher than 19% for the balance of the year to net a full year rate of 19%. Turning to capital deployment, we paid $276 million in dividend in the second quarter. We also purchased 900,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.1 million shares for the first half of the year for $436 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. Our focus for the balance of the year will be on paying down the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition, consistent with the near-term maturity structure that we established. We generated $787 million of cash from operations in the quarter and, after capital expenditures of $175 million, we have free cash flow of $612 million, a conversion rate of nearly 80%. That resulted in a net cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and a net debt position of $12.4 billion. For the year we expect free our cash flow to be in the low to mid 90% range reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional $255 million discretionary pension contribution that we discussed last quarter, which we paid in the third quarter. Lastly, a couple of highlights on our backlog. First, the addition of CSRA brought $5.3 billion of firm backlog to the company along with $8.5 billion of IDIQ and unexercised options, what we refer to as estimated potential contract value. In addition to this incremental backlog, the combined GDIT-CSRA had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times in the quarter bringing them to 1.1 times for the first half of the year. And one last point regarding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it relates to backlog. While FX rates had a de minimis impact on our reported sales and earnings in the quarter, changes in the rates from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter reduced our Combat Systems and Mission Systems backlogs by approximately $370 million and $75 million respectively. Excluding this impact, these two groups had a book-to-bill in the quarter of 0.9 times and 1 to 1 respectively. In fact, our defense businesses in aggregate had a book-to-bill of 0.9 times in the quarter and first six months of the year and that includes a very lumpy Marine Systems where, as Phebe noted, we anticipate some very large additions to the backlog in the form of a multi-year DDG and Virginia Block V contract later this year. Combined with the strong order activity and ongoing environment that Phebe described in the Aerospace group, we're set up to continue what's developing as a very nice growth story. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you a wrap up including our updated guidance for the year. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So let me provide our forecast for the year for each segment and compare it to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion up $220 million to $270 million from 2017, operating earnings slightly in excess of $1.5 billion and operating margin of around 18%. We now expect revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, with earnings roughly consistent with our January forecast. This implies pressure on margins in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when G500 deliveries begin in earnest. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.15 billion to $6.2 billion, up $200 million to $250 million from 2017 with operating earnings around $970 million on an operating margin of around 15.7%. We now expect revenue of $6.3 billion to $6.35 billion, operating earnings of approximately $990 million, with an operating margin around 15.5%, so approximately $150 million more revenue and $20 million more in operating earnings. For the Marine segment, we previously guided to revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, margins are at $8.7 billion and operating earnings of $735 million to $745 million. We now expect revenue to be slightly over $8.5 billion with margins slightly better than the previous forecast resulting in operating earnings of $745 million to $755 million. For IS&T, we guided to revenue of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion, up $400 million to $500 million from 2017, operating earnings of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, with a margin rate of around 11%. It now appears that our revenue forecast for the two legacy businesses is between $9.4 million and $9.5 billion. Rather than taking it any further of the old IS&T level, let me break it into the new business segments. First, Mission Systems. Their outlook for this year is revenue between $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins around 14%. This implies significant growth in revenue and earnings in the second half. Second, legacy GDIT will have revenue for the year of about $4.6 billion with margins around 8%. CSRA will add about $3.75 billion of revenue with operating margins growing 6%. So IT rolls up revenue of between $8.3 billion and $8.4 billion with operating earnings around $600 million and margins around 7%. So all of this sums to revenue for GD about $36.7 billion to $36.8 billion and operating margins somewhat in excess of 12%. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $10.90 to $11 to a range of $11 to $11.05. This increased outlook overcomes what we expect to be a $0.23 per share negative impact from all the charges related to the CSRA acquisition. Apart from those fees and expenses, we expect CSRA's contribution to be $0.11 this year. The difference then is from GD operating improvement. With that, I'll turn it back to Howard and address your questions. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Absolutely, Sir. Today's first question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Ron. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I think one topic that's sort of in the back of everybody's mind, if you could maybe put some perspective on it is one of the suppliers on the G500 is having financial difficulty, filed for bankruptcy and they're a supplier to you, your supplier Pratt Canada, so the Northern Group. I mean, how should investors think about what potential impact that could have and what it means? Because we're just getting a lot of questions on it and I think people just want to get a sense on how you're thinking about that. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So the current issue will have some impact on our deliveries to some extent this year but it is solvable. Let's remember that the (34:30) as manufactured and designed was approved through the FAA certification process. We are confident in that the parties will expeditiously resolve their dispute. Let's also \u2013 I think it's important to remember, this is really a terrific engine. It's quiet, its performance is superior and its highly efficient. So we will get through this. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So basically, I guess, is there any way you can give a \u2013 how disruptive could it be or not? Just kind of that kind of thing. Like, Phebe, everybody sort of worries about these things when they come up. And we've seen them come and go in the past and in the end, it don't usually amount to much. But if you could give people comfort on that, that would really be helpful. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, so this year, to the extent it affects some of the G500 deliveries, margins will go up and our earnings are going to be flat. So I'm pretty comfortable that we will get through this and the sooner we get through it, the better. But this is all solvable. And frankly, we can manage through this as can Pratt. Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, okay, great. I'll leave it there and let someone else ask their question. Thank you. Operator : And today's next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hi, good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : I wanted to just ask a closely related two-parter here on G500, G600. You've commented recently about in the impact on margins there as we look forward to next couple of years and my understanding is that's some non-recurring cost that you have to layer in on those initial production lots. How long does that stretch in terms of time that those impacts will be there for the G500 and G600? And then secondly, you talked about the G500 weighing on margins in the fourth quarter on those initial deliveries. Do you still expect those deliveries to be profitable, but still just dilutive to the overall Gulfstream or Aerospace margin? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes, they will be profitable. The first lot of airplanes tends to carry program costs that reduce margins. That said, we have always demonstrated superb operating performance in the manufacturing of our airplanes. So we will \u2013 as soon as we get through that, margins will ramp up very nicely on the G500 and G600. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : And does that happen in 2021? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: It'll happen before that. We've just got to get through a handful of the G500s and off we go. Operator : And today's next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Phebe, you mentioned that demand for the G650 is still very strong. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the current lead time is on that aircraft. And previously, you indicated that you might want to bring production down on that model. Is that still the case? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have begun to ramp down production on the G650 and will continue to do so, the pace at which, however ,we're going to have to discern as we do our plans for 2019 because the order book has been so strong. So the G650 is doing frankly quite nicely. What was the first part of your question? Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : The lead time, if I was to order one today. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: The lead time. So the lead times are well within our comfortable range of about 18 months. All of our airplanes are in a very comfortable range. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : And today's next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Phebe. So I wanted to follow up. Jason made the comment about deleveraging from here. I guess you have $2.5 billion in commercial papers. So can you talk about the pace at which you plan to delever? And then also on cash conversion, you touched on kind of mid-90s this year. What should we think about going forward given the high amortization levels associated with CSRA? Thanks. Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Hey, David. I think what you can expect in terms of deleveraging is that commercial paper that you see on the balance sheet that should be gone by the end of the year and you'll see call it roughly similar reductions for the next couple of years following that, all consistent with the maturities in our existing ladder. So that will all come as scheduled on maturity. With respect to free cash flow, we'll continue to target to be in the 90s to 100% range moving forward, all subject obviously as we've mentioned to investment for growth particularly in Marine Systems, but we'll continue to be in that 90s to 100% range as we look forward. Operator : And today's next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. I just wanted to go back to some comments, Phebe, that you made a little bit earlier in the year and make sure I understand them in detail. I thought that maybe for 2019 and 2020 we were going to be looking at the Aerospace margins coming down 200 to 300 basis points from the 2018 baseline. And I want to see if that's still the case and if not what's changed? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, look, our margins are going to be just fine. I'm not going to get into 2019 and 2020. That will all depend on our build rate, but we are going to be quite comfortable in our margin performance as we frankly always are at Gulfstream. So I wouldn't give that too much worry. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: There are going to be margin compressions because we got mix issue. That should be understood and fairly explicable. So we're in pretty good shape on that score. Operator : And today's next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the strong demand signals you're seeing in the market right now at Gulfstream. Could you give us a little more insight into how that goes by geography, customer type? And just have to ask, are you seeing any impact from the coming introduction of the new Bombardier models? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our order book is heavily North America with strong European interest and some increase in the Asia Pacific region, pretty consistent with the way \u2013 to the previous patterns of the order activity. Across the portfolio, the order book tends to be divided roughly in thirds by private company's high net worth individuals and public companies. So, look, our backlog is very durable and we understand who's in it. Many of them have been longtime customers. And the order activity continues. I think I've told you before, we're not very concerned about that airplane. We continue to sell the G650 at a good rate and we have some compelling attributes not satisfied with the 7500, including better range at restricted airports and more range at speed. I'd recommend that perhaps some folks should do some product comparisons that could help illuminate our lack of concern on that score. Operator : And today's next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little about Combat Systems. Just trying to think about the balance as we go forward and I guess this is even beyond this year with the recapitalization in the U.S., which I typically think is somewhat lower margin, but also looks like we're seeing strength in European defense spending and how that plays out for ELS and just thinking about the margin mix and the growth as we go forward there. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we're very comfortable with the growth estimates that we gave you for our long range plan back in January and that those estimates are undergirded by exactly the elements that you note. Interestingly, I have been watching the army for a very long time and under the leadership of Secretary Esper and General Milley, we've seen a focus on modernization to an extent that arguably hasn't been seen since the 1980s when the Army fielded the Big Five and they're budgeting their resources to support their modernization plan. They've also been working with industry very closely, which is very wholesome as we work to ensure that they get the best of class technologies and capabilities. So I'm very pleased with the demand signals coming out of the United States. The same is true in Europe. Our European Land Systems is growing at a nice rate and the book-to-bill in that whole business has been very wholesome. Combat, as I noted in my remarks, has been a growth engine for us for the last two years and will continue to be so. So, we like what we're seeing in Combat. Operator : And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you so much. So yesterday when Lockheed Martin reported they had a substantial increase in their revenue guidance for this year and they were making the point that they're seeing DoD kind of put new business under contract sooner than they had expected and early flow-through of the large Omnibus add-ons in the FY 2018 budget. Are you seeing any of that because you look like you have relatively modest revenue hikes for this year? So... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I thought we were... Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...are your numbers conservative? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I thought we were growing nicely. Hey, look, I don't know what... Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: I didn't say you weren't growing nicely, but it looks like \u2013 I mean, I'm just asking is this kind of a conservative number so it may have upside or is this kind of right down the fairway? How should we think about that? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I never comment on others. I can simply tell you that our revenue estimates are very consistent \u2013 today, are pretty consistent with where we were when we set this plan. We have a great deal of insight into our customers and their spend rates. And I think it's certainly in Marine, that's very steady predictable growth. Right? Combat is much the same way to the extent that we've seen some surprises, frankly, in the growth rate have been at CSRA and GDIT which grew very, very nicely. And we'll continue to do so and we've reflected that in our updated guidance. So no particular surprises here, frankly. We've been pretty forthright with you all on what we expected and that's what's happened and what is happening. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Yes. Good morning. Phebe, on Aerospace, the increase in revenues is primarily Hawker Pacific or were there additional deliveries? Could you provide what the updated deliveries might be? And then also on the margin with no G500 deliveries in the third quarter... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Whoa, I didn't say no. Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. Sorry about that. The increase in Aerospace guidance is primarily from the acquisition of Hawker Pacific or there're increased deliveries as well? And then second part of it is, with no G500 deliveries in Q3, you should have another strong margin, would imply that the fourth quarter margin would be 15% or less. I mean, is that a fair characterization? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So as I mentioned to you, we may have a few G500 deliveries in the third quarter. We said consistently that that first lot of G500s is going to carry lower margin and our guidance to you reflects that. The increase in revenue is a combination of a lot of different elements in this very complex portfolio, Hawker, mix in deliveries, increased service, so across sort of the whole canopy (49:01) of levers that present in any given quarter. That is our best estimate right now. I'm pretty confident in it in terms of the revenue and the earnings, frankly. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. I'll stick with the one question. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, George. Operator : And our next question today comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk about Marine longer term and what your expectations are there from a margin standpoint and what your mix of work is going to be on Columbia versus Virginia class, what your current line of thinking there is? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So think about large shipbuilding programs and businesses is typically having margins in the 8% to 10% range depending on the maturity of the program. So that's the prism through which we should look at the Marine Group. That said, as we ramp up on Columbia, we will see some margin compression quite naturally because that will be cost plus work. And given the long duration of the shipbuilding contracts and the shipbuilding process itself for any one of these single submarines, that margin compression can obtain for a while offset, of course, by increased improvements in our Virginia class performance which we have historically shown. So I don't have a good estimate right now for you of the out year estimate on the mix between Virginia and Columbia. Columbia will, in seven or eight years, completely dwarf or heavily dwarf Virginia. So it's simply because of the volume coming into the yard. Think about it this way, we start manufacture of that first Columbia in 20 and then it will ramp up pretty expeditiously through the next four or five years. So we'll be able as we \u2013 I think I mentioned from time ago, we signed last year a detailed design contract. Part of that contract is a detailed plan that we worked out with the Navy on exactly the sequencing of the requirements and the build strategy and the funding to go along with that. Once we get that ironed out in the next year and a half to two years, then we'll have quite a bit of clarity on exactly what this very long range program looks like. Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, just on CSRA, it sounds like it's nicely accretive. Can you maybe update your thoughts on how you're thinking about still the synergies? And I know there's some costs that you get to hold on or some cost reduction you get to hold on to and some you give back. But how are you thinking about that now that you've had the business for a few months? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So our costs and savings have baked into our estimates for the year. And with respect to CSRA, our integration is going very, very well. We're right on target, in fact, a little ahead of schedule. I suspect we will continue to see increased synergies over time. The beauty of putting these two businesses together is we can take the best-in-class out of GDIT in the best-in-class out of legacy CSRA and really marry those capabilities for some pretty impressive performance in the marketplace. The combined GDIT under the new GDIT has had a 75% win rate this year. That is pretty darn impressive for a highly competitive business. So I think that speaks to the power of the combination of these two businesses. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Just sticking on CSRA, can you maybe elaborate how we should think about retention rates for that business whether it's the employee base or just contract renewals? And Phebe, if you could just expand a little bit about the integration targets you mentioned. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have added about $900 million in this quarter alone to \u2013 over $900 million in our backlog on the combined contracts. With respect to employees, we have retained every single employee that we have wanted to retain. And the beauty of this integration is that we're taking the management team of CSRA and the management team of GDIT and we have melded it into a very, very effective, cohesive management team with a vision on how they want to proceed. They are melding the two cultures. They are bringing the best-in-class technical capabilities in each business and the customer intimacy in each business. So we're very pleased with our employee retention. We've had super contract generation. There have been frankly no surprises or disappointments in any of the contract activity since the acquisition. It's interesting, just to give you a little bit of perspective on this. GDIT grew 9% and, for the quarter, CSRA grew 12.6% and that's the particularly impressive given their 9% growth in the quarter prior to the acquisition. These businesses are doing extremely well. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: So we'll take one last question, operator. Operator : Absolutely. Our last question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. I don't know if this is, Phebe, for you or Jason, but I wanted to try and get at normalized margins in Aero and in GDIT just given the somewhat unusual moving pieces in the back end of the year here. So while I know you don't want to talk about 2019, once we get past this early lot of G500s and I'd ask you how many aircraft are in that lot. How do we think about it? Does Aerospace get back to a 20% margin whenever that time is? And then similar question on GDIT, how do we think about normalized margins there? Can CSRA get back to legacy GD levels or even higher? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yeah, Jason will address that. Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Let me take the CSRA, GDIT side. I think the way we're looking at it is if you adjust for the amortization impact, the incremental amortization from the transaction, CSRA is actually contributing margins consistent with their historic performance, double-digit performance and is accretive to the margins of the group, again ex that amortization. And a point on that, I noted in the remarks that we had \u2013 we're anticipating $190 million of amortization this year for the CSRA transaction. Under the accounting rules, that's actually an accelerated message. So we'll have $190 million for the nine months of this year followed by, I think, it's 200 million next year and then it'll ratchet down over time. So you'll see that in a little more detail in the 10-Q we'll publish later today. But that will, I think, help you sort of model impacts on margin rates, if you think of core CSRA contribution ex amortization in the double-digit range consistent with their history. So that's sort of the story on the GDIT side. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: On Gulfstream, so one of the things that you should by now think about us as a superb operating company. So we'll get through the initial lot, fairly expeditiously and you may ask the number in that lot, but I don't intend to tell you. And then begin our ramp down our learning curve. We've got synergies between the G500 and G600 lines because they are coproduced in the same facility. I'm not going to be predictive of how good can we get in the out years. But you can believe year in and year out, we will improve our performance on our airplanes. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe and Jason, and everybody else who was listening today. This ends our call. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. With that, we look forward to talking to you later today and in the days ahead. Goodbye. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics' Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' third quarter 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Howard, and good morning. As is apparent from our press release, we enjoyed another solid quarter. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.89 for fully diluted share on revenue of $9.1 billion, operating earnings of $1.14 billion, and income from continuing operations of $864 million. The EPS performance was $0.37 better than the year-ago quarter and $0.13 better than consensus. With respect to consensus, it would appear that our revenue was somewhat lower, margins somewhat higher and operating earnings essentially in line. Most of the beat occurred on the tax line. Against the year-ago quarter, revenue was up $1.5 billion or 20%, attributable in large part to the CSRA acquisition. However, revenue was up 4.6%, excluding the impact of CSRA. All five reporting segments grew quarter-over-quarter. Operating earnings were up $72 million, a 6.8% increase, and income from continuing operations was up $100 million, a 13.1% increase. The quarter's operating margin at 12.5% is 150 basis points lower than third quarter 2017, largely attributable to the amortization expense of the CSRA transaction. In terms of economic earnings, the operating earnings absent the amortization expense related to the transaction were $1.2 billion with an operating margin of 13.2%. Sequentially, revenue was down $92 million, or 1%, and operating earnings were up $47 million. The two quarters were very much alike. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $25.8 billion is up $3.12 billion, or 13.7%. Operating earnings were up $55 million, or 1.7%. Importantly, earnings from continuing operations were up $173 million, 7.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.71 or 9.5% better year-to-date. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $790 million and free cash flow from operations of $622 million after a discretionary pension payment in the quarter of $255 million. We continue to invest appropriately for the future. Capital spending at the Marine group has more than doubled to $147 million year-to-date, and expenditures at Aerospace have totaled $142 million for the nine months, as the business units continued to invest at a level necessary to expand facilities to support our customers' requirements. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a very healthy backlog increase in the quarter. The total backlog of $69.53 billion is a $3.24 billion increase, roughly 5% over the second quarter of this year, and $5.6 billion increase over the year-ago quarter. While there was very good contract activity in all groups, there was particularly strong order intake at the Marine group, Information Technology and Mission Systems. Mission Systems enjoyed a book-to-bill of 1.2 times and a sharp increase in its estimated potential contract value as a result of several IDIQ contracts. GDIT's book-to-bill was a sterling 1.4. Let me say a few words about each of our business groups, starting with Aerospace. Aerospace had another solid quarter. Revenue was up $36 million, or 1.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017, and operating earnings were nearly flat, off $5 million, or 1.3%, to $376 million on an operating margin of 18.5%. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $136 million, or 7.2%, with a $10 million reduction in operating earnings on lower margins, as expected. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was down $396 million, or 6.4%, and operating earnings are off $133 million, or 10.7% on a 90 basis point reduction in operating margin. The revenue picture will be stronger in the fourth quarter with the delivery of 8 to 10 G500s. By the way, the first G500 was delivered in September and the second several days ago. We had a good order intake in the quarter for the group, a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill measured in dollars values of orders. Gulfstream alone was 0.9 to 1 on the same basis. While order intake was certainly satisfactory in the group, it was not as good as we had anticipated. It was hampered by the contretemps surrounding NORDAM's financial issues and its inability to deliver nacelles to Pratt on schedule. This caused numerous G500 and G600 prospects to hold fire until we could provide more reliable delivery times. That, I am pleased to say, is behind us and should help fourth quarter intake. Gulfstream has taken over the production of nacelles and is making very good progress on both cost and schedule. Deliveries of nacelles are in line to support the 8 to 10 G500s next quarter. I can also tell you that our pipeline in sales discussions are quite active. We are, again, reasonably optimistic about order intake in the fourth quarter and expect it to look better than the third quarter, even accounting for the increased delivery in Q4. On a trailing 12 months basis, the book-to-bill is slightly in excess of 1 to 1. Our certification front continues to progress well on the G600 and we anticipate certification shortly before year-end with deliveries commencing next year. The G600 has profited from the work done on the G500, so those first delivery lot will carry better gross margins. The G500 with 5,200 nautical miles of range at 0.85 can travel 4,400 nautical miles at 0.9. Just to put that in some context; 4,400 nautical miles was the approximate range of its predecessor, the G450 at 0.8 mach, cutting nearly an hour from long-range flight. The G600 with 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.85 mach has now also demonstrated 5,500 nautical miles of range at 0.9 mach, actually quite stunning. If you recall, when we announced the G500 and G600 in 2014, our plan was to deliver in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have done so with the G500 and will do so with the G600. Next, Combat Systems, Combat had a solid quarter with revenue of $1.52 billion, operating earnings of $241 million and 15.8% operating margins. Compared to the third quarter in 2017, revenue was up $23 million, or 1.5%, but earnings were down $6 million or 2.4% on a 70 basis point decline in margin. On a sequential basis, the second and third quarters were very much alike, with no material difference in volume or profit. Year-to-date revenue was up over 2017 by $296 million or 7%. Operating earnings are up $24 million, or 3.5%, despite a 50 point basis decline in operating margin. I should point out that Combat Systems has now reported quarter over year-ago quarter increases in revenue for eight consecutive quarters. All of our major programs are performing well. We continue to see opportunities for growth, both internationally and domestically. Importantly, our work with the U.S. Army has increased nicely. In addition to fully supporting the Abrams main battle tank, the Army has recently placed a $383 million order to upgrade 173 Strykers to the A1 configuration, the newest, most powerful and capable version of the vehicle. The order will complete the fourth brigade and begin the process of modernizing the fifth, part of a process to modernize all nine brigades. We are also actively involved with the Army's longer-term modernization efforts and have developed innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet their requirements. For Marine, the group reported revenue of $2 billion, a $72 million or 3.7% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. In contrast, revenue was down sequentially by $165 million, or 7.6%. Operating earnings for the third quarter at $169 million were down $10 million compared to last year's quarter. As expected, there was a sequential decline in profit margins due to mix. Year-to-date revenue of $6.2 billion was higher by $261 million, or 4.4% and operating earnings of $548 million were up $30 million, or 5.8% over 2017. Revenue across the year has been driven by construction of the Virginia-class Block IV, Block V design and Columbia design work. Offsetting this was timing related to ship repair and other naval construction work. With four recent awards for repair work, we should expect a step-up in volume for that category. Just prior to the close of the quarter, we received a multi-year contract from the Navy for four DDG 51 Flight III ships. The $3.9 billion contract affords Bath the opportunity to move down the learning curve and improve its performance. The ships are scheduled as part of the FY 2019 through 2025. We told you last quarter that we would report IS&T in two segments, Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, one of the leading providers of IT services to the Department of Defense, intelligence agency and federal civil agencies. Let's start with Mission Systems. Mission Systems' revenue at $1.23 billion was $144 million, or 13.3% higher than last year's quarter. Year-to-date revenue of $3.48 billion was higher by $249 million, or 7.7% over last year. Operating earnings of $179 million were up $27 million, or 17.8% compared to the third quarter last year, with mix and the benefit of operating leverage generating the better performance. Similarly, year-to-date operating earnings were up $27 million or a 6% increase. I have already commented upon Mission Systems' very strong order intake in the quarter, which further supports their anticipated organic and future growth. Moving to Information Technology, the business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in the quarter, up $1.2 billion or 116% over the year-ago quarter. The revenue for GDIT was up 7.1%, excluding CSRA. By the way, we're not going to be able to break out CSRA revenue for you after this year. Operating profits were $1.57 million, up $56 million or 55%. Reported margins were 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. But excluding the acquisition related amortization of $64 million, margins were 9.6%. CSRA was modestly accretive in the quarter. It is $0.05 accretive year-to-date, excluding transition costs. This is really quite remarkable this early in an acquisition. The integration plan is sound and continues to deliver early results. Finally, we've announced the divestiture of our call centers to MAXIMUS as part of our portfolio-shaping strategy. This transaction creates focus on enterprise IT solutions and high-end professional services. We are business-to-business focused and this shifts us away from the more public-facing markets. These assets are well-placed with MAXIMUS, for whom it is core. By the way, this transaction will have no material impact to 2018 results. So what does all this mean as far as the next quarter and the year are concerned, we fully expect fourth quarter revenue in excess of $10 billion and operating margins consistent with the last quarter. However, we expect a higher effective tax rate of around 21% in the quarter. For the year, stronger-than-expected operating results year-to-date offset in part by the $75 million of CSRA transactions costs and a lower-than-planned tax rate enabled us to increase guidance for the year from a range of $11 to $11.05 to a range of $11.10 to $11.15 for the year. This late in the year we anticipate our end-of-year guidance to be pretty close to actual performance, so the range is narrow. As tempting as it may be this time of year to ask us about next year, let me remind you that we have our planning process later this fall when the businesses get better insight in the upcoming year. The guidance we gave you last January is grounded in that process, and as a result, was full and thorough. So I don't want to prematurely piecemeal next year at this juncture. You'll hear from me in January with more detail, as has been our custom for many years. So let me spend a minute telling you how I see this year in perspective. We are growing 4.9% without CSRA. We have double-digit EPS growth. Gulfstream is growing at 4.5%, and that's particularly impressive during a year of transition. The CSRA integration is ahead of schedule. The U.S. Army is recapitalizing, and the Marine group is steady as she goes. And Mission Systems is performing beautifully. And finally, our backlog is large and growing, which puts us in very good stead for next year. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason Wright Aiken - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $114 million, bringing the year-to-date expense to $244 million. That compares to $27 million and $76 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $355 million. Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter and 17.1% year-to-date. This is lower than our previous expectation and is attributable to the finalization during the quarter of our 2017 tax return. As a result, we are lowering our target for the full year tax rate from our previous estimate of 19% to a rate in the low 18% range. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 21%. One more point on the income statement. We had a discontinued operations charge in the quarter of $13 million or $0.04 per share. You'll recall, we sold a piece of the CSRA business due to an organizational conflict of interest issue. Under the accounting rules, this sale resulted in a breakeven pre-tax GAAP P&L outcome. However, there was a gain on the sale for tax purposes, and the tax expense on that gain is reported in discontinued operations. Turning to capital deployment, we paid $275 million in dividends in the third quarter and purchased 450,000 shares of our stock, bringing us to 2.5 million shares year-to-date for $522 million. This is consistent with our plan to acquire enough shares in 2018 to hold our share count steady. In addition, as Phebe discussed, in light of the benefits associated with the recent tax reform, we made a $255 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan in the quarter and have ramped up our capital expenditures, which we expect to be in excess of 2% of sales for the year. We also repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper in the quarter, consistent with our priority of rapidly repaying the debt issued to finance the CSRA acquisition. To that end, we expect to fully repay our CP balance by the end of the year, which will retire over a quarter of the borrowings from the acquisition. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was over 90%, excluding the discretionary pension contribution. And for the year, we expect our free cash flow to be in the low to mid-90% range, reflecting our typical 100% conversion target, less the additional pension contribution. Finally, one more follow-up to Phebe's comments about our order activity in the quarter, the total company book-to-bill was 1.4 times in the quarter, resulting in a 5% increase in the total backlog to $69.5 billion. And when you include options and IDIQ contracts, the total potential contract value increased to an all-time high of $104.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This backlog growth is all the more impressive given the ongoing headwind presented by foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which impact our Combat Systems segment, in particular, given its significant international footprint. Specifically, over the first nine months of the year, FX rate changes driven by the strong dollar reduced the segment's backlog by $600 million. Of course, this is an accounting translation effect with no economic value implication, but a headwind to the reported numbers nonetheless. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question, so that everyone has a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please get back in the queue. Gary, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : The first question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Sam. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the G500 and just this whole NORDAM situation. Only because United Technologies talked about a settlement, I believe, that there was a cash inflow. So, can you help us in terms of any impact that might have had in terms of the P&L and did it occur in this quarter or is it something that is still to come in the fourth quarter? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, there were no material adjustments to revenue or earnings as a result of this settlement. That said, the details of the settlement are subject to a non-disclosure agreement, so that's all we can say. Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, David. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Phebe, I wanted to ask about a couple part question on Gulfstream. So, I know you said you didn't want to talk about 2019, but I think this is fair game since you've talked about before, just the operating income cadence from here in 2019 and 2020 relative to the $1.5 billion for Gulfstream. I think you talked about a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020, how you feel about that now. And then, NBAA, we heard comments about G550 orders coming through pretty well and the rate going up there, but we also heard about maybe a little bit nearer-term availability on G650; if you could tell us where that stands today. Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, let me just get clarity on the first part of your question. Can you restate that for me? David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. So, previously, I believe you've talked about $1.5 billion in EBIT at Gulfstream in 2018 and then a slight increase in 2019 and a slight increase off of that in 2020. If that still holds, how you feel about that. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, I don't want to get into 2019, but think about it this way. We have 8 to 10 of the G500s delivering this year that carry really relatively very low margins. We'll have the remainder of that lot delivering in 2019. And then, as we move into the G600 production, those margins are going to be higher since the G500 carried a disproportionate burden of the test program. So, all-in-all, we're comfortable with the implied guidance that we gave you back in January this year and that's about all I could go into at the moment until we set all of our production rates. So that's with respect to that. On the G550, we adjust that rate accordingly. We haven't made that decision yet, but there is very nice demand for that platform, particularly in the ISR space. So as long as there continue to be government customers who see this as a powerful ISR system, and then we'll continue to produce those at fairly low level. And the availabilities of G650 are still out there. I'm not aware of any near-term availabilities whatsoever. Operator : The next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey, good morning, all. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : I just want to go back quickly to the NORDAM settlement. I mean UTC was pretty explicit yesterday that they had a $300 million payment related to that. So I can appreciate the terms of the NDA, but just methodologically speaking, if you didn't have a gain in Q3 and the guidance doesn't imply a gain in Q4, like where does this $300 million go? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: First of all, no one can discern the number. Second of all, it is simply not material. So I \u2013 and while UT can be a little more expansive on this agreement, we, however, are bound by a nondisclosure, which I will not violate. So there you go. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Phebe, on the defense side of the business, obviously been some issues with Saudi Arabia of recent. I was wondering if you could comment on what the potential backlog exposure you have is to Saudi Arabia and whether this is having any impact on your near-term order prospects. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So I don't know what the backlog is. We don't look at it in that regard. I will tell you the largest contract we have is with the government of Canada. We are continuing to build that vehicle on schedule, and we see no indication that that contract has changed, the status of that contract has changed in the moment. So, steady as she goes. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Phebe. Quick question just, I guess, on Marine Systems \u2013 I mean, Mission Systems. The margin performance continues to be really impressive there. 14.6% and 13.8% year-to-date. I mean, is there a natural ceiling here for margin when you look at the contract mix? Or what's the kind of cadence, I guess, when you think about Mission Systems? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, Mission Systems margins are driven most especially by mix and product mix. And that can, in any given quarter, in any given year, vary. But their performance, I think, is indicative of their future performance, again, driven by their mix. And it's wholly dependent on thousands of different products and simply the timing of the orders and the profitability of various different products within that portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, can you just do me a favor and parse back that comment you made around the margin differential between the G500 and G600, particularly around the test flights? Is it fair to assume that the margins on the G600 should probably hit a double-digit rate before G500, despite the G500 deliveries ramping a little bit quicker? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Oh, I'm not going to parse that. I don't think I know that in the moment. And frankly, I start to get nervous about giving specificity of margins by airplane that becomes highly competitive. But the fact is, is they will carry better gross margins because they do not have the larger share of the test program. And you'll recall, there was a fair amount of commonality between the G500 and the G600 test program. So we'll come down quickly. We'll go up where margins will increase nicely on the G500 once we get through the first lot, and they will continue to perform well once we \u2013 it's an analogous performance on the G600. Think about it that way. But just at a higher start rate. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Myles. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Hey. I have one clarification question, and one question. So on the clarification, you mentioned the fourth quarter color of greater than $10 million sales and segment margin similar to last quarter. I just wanted to make sure you're talking about 2Q and not the 3Q reported number? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Okay. 2Q. And then in terms of the top-line, the greater than $10 billion and the implied 4.9% organic growth, I just want to make sure we are triangulating to the right sales number, so we are now looking somewhere in the lower $36 billion? Is that right, for the full year? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Yes. Yes, and we gave you, you will be able to discern all of the particular puts and takes in the Q. We have laid all that out for you, okay? So that should help you. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: Is there a particular segment, I imagine it's Aerospace on the G500 deliveries, is that right? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, there's Aerospace in two regards. One, it looks like we are going to have considerably lower pre-owned sales than we had anticipated, which frankly is a good thing from a bottom-line perspective. And as you quite accurately point out, we've had fewer G500 deliveries than we had originally anticipated. And then on the other defense groups, it's really just a question of timing and when the contracts get executed. So nothing of note across any of the defense units. Myles Alexander Walton - UBS: All right. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning, George. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : On your comment, Phebe, about the book to bill of being 0.9 and you didn't have G500 and G600 orders delayed but you didn't deliver any G500s, so the fact that the book to bill was 0.9, does that imply G650 orders or G550 book to bill were less than one? And also, what's the number of months now that you are sold out to on each of those planes? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, I don't track that data that you asked for. And by the way, I have come to a conclusion that I'm not going to give you detailed, first available, because it becomes meaningless with all these new airplanes coming out. We may ultimately go back to that but there's too much churn in the next year or so because we've got so many new airplanes coming out. But they are well within the comfortable levels that I've talked about before, so I don't have any concern across our existing plane portfolio. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : But was the book to bill less than one for the G650 and/or the G550? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: No, we don't track that. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : Okay. I will stick with my one. Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Painful as it is for you. George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC : That's right. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I wanted ask \u2013 hey, good morning, Phebe. I wanted to ask you about Marine, couple of things on Marine. The first and they're both on margins. I wanted to think about the ramp of the Columbia over the next couple of years, few years and how we should think about margins on that. And then separately on the DDG-51, the recent award, which has the Huntington pricing, you've got four ships there out of 10, how do we think about that impact from a margin perspective? I suppose while we're at it, perhaps we could talk about revenues too. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So, we were very pleased with the outcome of that competition with four ships, because it gives Bath a nice opportunity to improve its profitability. And if you think about Bath's performance, on the DDG-1000, we've had terrific ship over ship learning. We have delivered the first of the restart, I think, guess the second of the restart ships on the DDG-51 and the third is under construction. We are seeing some nice ship over ship learning there. So from my point of view, this is a wholesome development for Bath and gives us really the opportunity to get where they need to be. With respect to margins, a bit large, I think in Marine. Right now, margin performance in the Marine group is driven almost entirely by timing and mix at Electric Boat. You've got higher Block IV and Columbia-class engineering volume lower margins offset by the lower Virginia-class Block III, a very mature contract that is close to \u2013 I think we delivered our final ship. So, if you recall, you've been with us now through three of these block transitions and remember that we did these ships on a continuous learning curve. So, it's incumbent upon us to ensure that we've got the operating excellence moved down our learning curve and we've done that with all three ships, or all three blocks. And you're just going to see some of that again on Block IV. There are, however, opportunities to improve those margins on Block IV, obviously, as we have in the past, and we've got improvements coming at Bath and NASSCO. Ultimately, margins can benefit as we \u2013 if you think about Columbia as we decrease our engineering work and move more toward construction of Columbia, but none of that will be clear until we get a contract in place on Columbia. And we don't think we're going to see that for the next year or so. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Should we think about, though, as your mix of business going to a less mature phase, though, so overall margins could drift down a little bit? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: I don't want to get out there too much on margins. I said something, I think, inadvisably the last time, I think, on this call. And the way that I think about these margins is, look, we've got quarter variability, but the trend is there. And there's a lot of moving parts as we move into Columbia, because the decrease in the cost plus decrease in the engineering work, which carries lower margins and the advent of construction, that offers some opportunities. So, I think that at the moment it's too soon to tell, but there is potential to get better. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk about some of the portfolio-shaping opportunities you've had thus far. Is there space to do a little bit more in terms of trimming down CS GDIT or is that about it? And then, also on the other side, is there capacity to do more M&A, as that integration seems to be progressing well and you're progressing down the deleveraging process? Thank you. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So as is our want, we are constantly looking for opportunities to shape our portfolio to better align our lines of business with our core. And in the case of the large public-facing call centers, they really have a better home with MAXIMUS, which allows us to focus on our core, enterprise IT, IT infrastructure and professional services and IT business solutions. On a going-forward basis, we, as you can expect, will continue to look for portfolio-shaping opportunities. However, I think we've made it pretty darn clear, our priority for capital deployment is we're going to draw down net debt, pay down net debt fairly expeditiously. So, you should think about that. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. So, Phebe, NORDAM, you took over the plant in early September, and you said that basically the orders were hurt because of uncertainty about delivery positions. Is it fully on track now? And, therefore, I assume you can offer firm delivery positions. And have we seen any pickup in orders? And what is the extent of the delay about, from the fact that they were kind of down for, what, 50 days or something without any production? Should we look for the first quarter to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, you quite rightly point out that we now own a line, and I am always more comfortable when I can control my own destiny, particularly when it's in our sweet spot of operating excellence. So, as you can well imagine, Gulfstream has started up that line, stabilized the supply chain and we're in the process of sending nacelles to Gulfstream to support our G500 and G600 deliveries this year. We don't have a \u2013 we are not at full rate production, it takes a while at the nacelles, on the nacelle line, it takes a while to get that up, and you can be rest assured, we will get there and then have real clarity around \u2013 and specificity around delivery times. And yes, we've seen customers who are increasingly comforted and interested because we can now give them with greater assurity you're going to get your airplane on date certain. So I consider that all very wholesome. Can you repeat the last part of your question? Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: I think, so we've heard that it's like a one-month delay. Excuse me, a one quarter delay. So should we expect that Q1, you're kind of going to be up or are we going to see Q1 still being very, very depressed because of the recovery from NORDAM issues? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Okay. I understand now. So the way to think about this is that we are reducing the impact in terms of time, shortening the time span as we increase our production on the nacelle. So it's really too soon to tell, but I think we will be well-positioned to support pretty robust manufacturing of the G500 in Q1. Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Hi, Doug. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. On Marine, there's been a lot of discussion around the Navy about the need for a larger fleet, but also certainly the ability to fund the growth. And history has shown these growth plans can have a lot of uncertainty. Can you describe how you think about your capital investment plans for Marine? Huntington Ingalls has raised theirs even more. I mean, when do you decide to invest and when do you wait? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, yeah, the key in any capital deployment investment is to, as quickly as possible, marry in terms of time the capital expenditure with the return. And so the Navy understands that and has worked very closely through contract provisions to ensure that that happens. We've got $1.7 billion in our facilities master plan, not exclusively, but well, actually exclusively at Electric Boat. And there's another couple hundred million at the other two yards in order to support this increase in Navy shipbuilding. So I am quite comfortable that our \u2013 particularly at Electric Boat where the preponderance of the funding is deployed and will be deployed is appropriate, and timed well to support the Navy's construction. This is all pretty wholesome. We have got to prepare for the construction of this very, very large and important Columbia-class missile boat. And that's what we're doing right now. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's the main \u2013 would that be the main focus then? I guess what I'm getting at is the Columbia classes, we've said, is a very secure trajectory. Some other programs may be less so and... Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: Well, look, I am capitalizing for the ships that I know that I'm going to compete in. We do not capitalize for programs that have yet to become programs of record and fully funded and supported by the U.S. Congress. That's not a wholesome business decision. Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning. So I noticed a nice pickup in the backlog in Mission Systems, and since there are a wider variety of smaller programs, I guess, in that segment. So, just as we think going forward maybe relative to investment account outlay growth over the next few years which is probably going to be mid or high-single digits, how should we think about the ability of Mission Systems to grow relative to that? And are there any of the pieces of the business, are there any of them that are much more positioned to outperform or underperform that level? Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So in terms of cyber, EW and ground forces communications and networks, we are very well positioned on a going-forward basis. If you think about the backlog increase, we had an award of a very large contract for IDIQ for CHS-5. And then we also had a new line of business, Life Cycle Product Management (sic) [Life Cycle Product Line Management] contract from the Army. So those were all \u2013 those were both very important, and provides a platform for continued growth. As the Army re-capitalizes and innovates around its ground forces, networking and comms, we are in the sweet spot of that relationship with the Army. So look, a lot of \u2013 if you think about it, these very impressive win rates for high-cycle businesses are really driven by being a low-cost, high-quality producer with \u2013 undergirded by very strong intimacy with our customers to understand their needs so that we're bringing them the products and capabilities, frankly, irrespective of vendors that can best suit their needs. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: And, Gary, I'd like to afford the time for one last question, please? Operator : And that question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Phebe, just a follow-up on Marine. There was some news over the summer about missile tube production issues from at least one of the suppliers and I think some people in D.C. feared it could negatively impact the whole program from a cost and schedule standpoint. So I just was wondering if you could maybe talk about that and if you think it'll impact the program or if it's a problem may be easily resolved. Phebe N. Novakovic - General Dynamics Corp.: So we have worked very closely with the Navy on ensuring that the issues are identified and resolved, and it has not had an impact on Columbia's schedule. But you raise tangentially an interesting point, and that is the readiness of the supply chain to support what is significant growth. And the U.S. Navy and the Congress have recognized that with an appropriation of about $450 million for precisely the purpose of supplier and Electric Boat production readiness. So you don't \u2013 you want to exercise that supply chain before you go into full rate production to identify any potential challenges, and we're in the process of doing that. This is a very important risk reduction effort that the U.S. Congress and the Navy have undertaken, and we are very pleased with it. So this is \u2013 more to come on that, all right? Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors : Good color. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. Howard Alan Rubel - General Dynamics Corp.: Thank you for joining us on our call today. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning and thank you Howard. We enjoyed a solid fourth quarter, the results in comparisons with prior period were straightforward for the most part. As a result, I will go through them briefly to leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2019 and your questions. I also think you will find the press release and the additional presentation on our website fulsome and helpful. So earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.38 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $909 million and earnings of $3.07 per fully diluted share. This is a significant improvement against the fourth quarter of 2017, which was adversely impacted by a discrete, $119 million increase in the tax provision as a result of a 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even after adjusting for the adverse impact in Q4, 2017. EPF was up $0.07 and earnings from continuing operations were up $154 million. Earnings per share at $3.07 also beat consensus by $0.09. Revenue and operating earnings were largely consistent with consensus. Most of the difference comes from a lower tax provision and a somewhat lower share count. For all-in-all, a solid quarter, with good performance, particularly compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2018. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.22. This is also $0.09 above consensus. Revenue was $36.2 billion was up over 2017 by $5.2 billion. On an organic basics, excluding CSRA, revenue was up $1.5 billion. Revenue was up across each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion were up $221 million or 5.2% over 2017. Earnings from continuing operations were up $446 million or 15.3% over 2017. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $166 above 2017. All-in-all, 2018 was a very good year. A year of growth and a year of important order intake that left the company well-positioned for 2019. I will review the full year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis for the groups without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we had more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations, and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter 2018. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.7 billion was up against the year ago quarter by an impressive $722 million, that is 36.4%. This was attributable both in large part to the delivery of nine G500 in the quarter, and also a strong fourth quarter in the service centers. For the full year, revenue of $8.46 billion was up $326 million, or 4%. Operating earnings of $1.49 billion were down $87 million on lower operating margins. The lower operating earnings were attributable to poor performance in the completions business at Jet Aviation, the mix shift at Gulfstream, and cost attendant to the introduction of the G500. This time last year, we told you to expect revenue between $8.35 billion to $8.4 billion with a margin rate of 18% leading to forecasted earnings of $1.5 billion. We finished the year with more than forecasted revenue at 17.6% margin, and $1.49 billion of operating earnings. All-in-all, very close to the forecast we gave you this time last year. On the order front, activity in the quarter was good and the pipeline activity remains robust. The book-to-bill in Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.8 to $1 denominated. You can see more information on deliveries and orders in the Exhibit J to the press release. We expect the G600 to be certified this year, although the exact timing is hard to predict given the impact of the government shutdown on the FAA. But we fully expect certification of the 600 this half. The pacing item for deliveries of the G500 and 600 will be our ability to deliver in the sales. We have that line in good order. Costs are increasingly under control and we are producing very good quality. But we had to restart the supply chain that had gone dormant with the far filing of the NORDAM bankruptcy proceedings. That has impacted right in our ability to keep schedule. We expect all schedule issues to be behind us by mid-year. As a result, you will see accelerating G500 deliveries as the year progresses, and our ability to provide in the south to support G600 deliveries in the second half as well. Next, Combat Systems, Combat revenue of $1.74 billion was almost the same as the year ago quarter. The same holds true for operating earnings of $251 million and an operating margin of 15%. For the full year, revenue of $6.24 billion was up $292 million, just short of 5%. Operating earnings of $952 million were up $25 million on a 40 basis point contraction in margin, largely related to mix shift. By the way, this performance is reasonably consistent with the forecasts we provided at this time last year. We enjoyed somewhat better revenue than our initial forecast, which was an increase of $200 million to $250 million over 2017. We actually grew revenue $292 million. We forecast operating earnings of $970 and came in at $962, an $8 million shortfall largely attributable to the diplomatic issues that slowed production of a vehicle program in Canada in the fourth quarter. We continue to see nice order activity in this group, but fourth quarter orders of $2.19 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.3 to 1 in the quarter and 1 to 1 for the year. Tank orders alone are in excess of a billion. We also continue to have significant international opportunities particularly in Europe. We\u2019ve been negotiating with Spain with respect to a program valued at $2 billion for Piranha vehicles. And of note, we acquired FWW, a qualified maintenance and service provider to the German Army and other international customers to enhance our position in a key market. FWW will become part of European land systems. In our U.S. market, our army customer is modernizing and providing a growing demand across our Combat vehicles and munitions business. In short, this group had quite positive revenue growth, continued its history of strong margin performance and had very good order activity. Next, Marine Systems. This is a really good news story across the board. Marine revenue of $2.3 billion was up $237 million, a stunning 11.5% over the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $213 million were up $46 million against the year ago quarter, a 27.5% increase on a 120 basis point improvement in operating margin. This is very strong operating leverage in a growth environment. By the way, the sequential comparison equally impressive. For the full year, revenue of $8.5 billion was up $498 million in excess of 6%. Operating earnings for the year of $751 million were up $76 million over 11% on a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin. At this time last year, we told you to expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $735 to $745. We came in at the higher end of the revenue range. Operating earnings of $761 outperformed our forecasts by $16 million to $26 million. In response to the significant increased demand from our Navy customer across all three of our shipyards, we continue to invest in each of our yards with particular emphasis at electric boat to prepare for increased production associated with the Block V of the Virginia submarine program and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. As you may recall, Block V is a significant upgrade in size and performance requiring additional manufacturing capacity. As you know, we have also increased our internal training program as well as our public private partnerships with Connecticut and Rhode Island to meet our need for skilled trade. At $243 million CapEx in 2018 from Marine was more than double its depreciation for the year. For 2019, we again expect a Marine segment to command a larger share of our capital budget as we work towards satisfying the nation\u2019s need for its critical naval systems. So far suffice it to say, we are poised to support our Navy customers and increase the size of the fleet. As you are aware, the information systems technology group have been realigned and reshaped into two separate segments. Mission Systems, a large C4ISR business; and GDIT, a leading providers of Information Solutions to the federal government and its agencies. That was supplemented in the second quarter of 2018, by the acquisition of CSRA. I\u2019m going to ask Jason to interject from comparison data here that you might find relevant and helpful. Jason Aiken : On that note, let me make some comments about GDIT and Mission System\u2019s performance in 2018. We originally guided to full year revenue for the former IS&T business group between $9.3 billion and $9.4 billion, and operating earnings of approximately one billion 30 million. If we look at how Mission Systems and GDIT excluding CSRA did for the year, they combined for $9.325 billion in sales, so in line with our expectations and that includes an organic growth rate of 4.3% for GDIT notwithstanding the impact of several divestitures during the year. From an operating earnings perspective, they were actually closer to $1.50 billion on a combined basis, so somewhat better than we had expected. So all-in-all a solid year for both businesses. As I alluded to, we also completed several portfolios shaping our activities in our GDIT segment during the year. These included the sale of a commercial health products business, CSRAs SETA business, and our public-facing call centers. These divestitures of more than $1 billion of annualized sales enhance the group's focus on high-end solutions and high-value added customer needs. Phebe Novakovic : So let\u2019s first address information technology. Information technology enjoyed revenue in the quarter of $2.38 billion and operating earnings of $194 million with an operating margin of 8.1%. Since the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017 did not include CSRA, comparison to the year ago quarter are not particularly meaningful. However, sequentially revenue is up $75 million, operating earnings up $37 million and operating margin up 130 basis points, evidence of our continuing ability to extract cost synergies here. For the year, revenue was $8.27 billion and operating earnings were $608 million with a 7.4% margin, once again annual comparisons do not offer meaningful perspective since the prior year did not include CSRA. Next, Mission Systems. Revenue in the quarter was essentially flat against the year ago quarter, while operating earnings of $181 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter last year on a 40 basis point decrement in operating margin. For the year, revenue of $4.73 billion was up $245 million or 5.5%. Operating earnings of $659 million were up $21 million or 3.3% due to a 30 basis point decline in operating margin driven in part by mix. Book-to-bill for the year was somewhat above 1 times till the end of the year with the modestly higher backlog at 5.3 billion. So on this call last year on a company wide basis, our forecast for 2018 was to expect revenue of 32.35 billion to 32.45 billion. Operating earnings of 4.25 billion and an operating margin of 13.1%. And as you know, we wound up with $36.2 billion on an organic basis, but on an organic basis, revenue was up $1.5 billion, $500 million more than forecast. At the EPS line, we forecasted $10.90 to $11 and came in at $11.22 including, the transaction costs related to CSRA, which are about $0.20 [ph] per share. So let me provide our forecast for 2019, initially by business group and then on a companywide roll out. In Aerospace, we expect 2019 revenue to be about $9.7 billion, up more than $1.2 billion on deliveries of approximately 145 business jets. Operating earnings will be slightly in excess of $1.5 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 15.5%. The margin rate is lower than 2018 as a result of the mix shift as well as a modest increase in pre-owned sales, which again generally carry no margin. The revenue will be back-end loaded as well as the margin rate. In general, the quarterly spread in revenue progression will look something like $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion. Operating margin in the first two quarters should be in the mid 14 area, strengthening in Q3 and moving to well over 17 in Q4. We believe that last year will be the low point in operating earnings during this transition to our new models with modest earnings increase in 2019 and 2020, and significant earnings traction thereafter. In Combat, we expect revenue to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, $250 million to $350 million increase over 2018 with operating earnings of $965 to $975 slightly better than last year. Here again, look for both the revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to see solid growth for this business with orders for the Abrams and sudden demand for Stryker vehicles and munitions. We see domestic volume expanding faster than our international business. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9 billion, a 6% or $500 million increase over 2018. Operating earnings in 2019 are anticipated to be about $770 million with an operating margin rate of around 8.5%. We anticipate growth in each of the yards with mix being reflected in margins. We continue to see long term growth with an expanding need for submarines, surface combat, and support ships and overhaul work. Our biggest opportunity here is around outperforming the forecasted margin rate. We expect information technology revenue in 2019 of approximately $8.3 billion consistent with 2018 with margins in the 7.5% range, a slight improvement over 2018s performance. To the plus side, we have a full year CSRA offset by the divestitures of the call centers and SETA businesses, which represented just over a billion of prior year revenues. We see the business making excellent progress towards optimizing the acquisition as we combine teams, deeply integrate business systems, consolidate facilities and increase our value proposition to diverse, defense, Intel and federal civilian agencies. For Mission Systems, we expect revenue in 2019 somewhere between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion, an increase of just over $100 million or between 2% to 3%. We see strong growth in our maritime, cyber and space-related markets with fairly steady top line in our core tactical network incumbency. We are anticipating operating earnings up modestly over last year with margins in the mid, between mid and high 30s, once again building throughout the year. So for 2019, company-wide all of this roll up to approximately $38.5 billion of revenue up by 6% over 2018. Operating earnings of $4.5 billion and operating margin of around 11.7%. This gives us an EPS forecast of $11.60 to $11.70 per fully diluted share. I may emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a low 18% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. With respect to the quarterly progression for EPS, the first quarter should be seasonally low at about 20% of the full year\u2019s results. The second quarter should be more than 10% better than that, and the third quarter should account for over 25% of EPS and the final quarter of the year could represent about one third of our EPS. So now let me turn this over to Jason for additional commentary around cash backlog and other items and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Phebe. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $112 million bringing the interest expense for the year to $356 million. That compares to $27 million and $103 million in the comparable periods of 2017. The increase in 2018 is due to the roughly $10 billion of debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We repaid approximately $1.7 billion of this debt during the year, and will continue to prioritize paying down debt consistent with our Mid-A credit rating. We ended the year with $850 million of commercial paper outstanding, and our next scheduled fixed debt maturity is in the second quarter of 2020. For 2019, we expect interest expense to be approximately $430 million reflecting a full year of the notes issued in 2018. Our effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year in line with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2019, we expect a full year effective tax rate in the low 18% range, between 18% and 18.5%. This is slightly higher than 2018, but recall in 2018, we took advantage of a onetime benefit provided by tax reform, and made a $255 million discretionary pension contribution, which lowered the tax rate by approximately 75 basis points. Looking at capital deployment, we paid $274 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.1 billion. We also took advantage of the market decline in December, by purchasing our shares to a greater degree than planned. In the quarter, we purchased 7.6 million shares of our stock for $1.3 billion bringing the full year to 10.1 million shares for $1.8 billion. Looking ahead, while debt repayment will continue to be a priority as I mentioned, we continue to have the flexibility to adjust our capital deployment in response to changing market conditions as we did in December. Moving on to our pension plans, we contributed approximately $570 million to our plans in 2018, including the discretionary contribution. For 2019, we expect that amount to be approximately $200 million to be contributed mostly during the third quarter. We\u2019ve also ramped up our capital expenditures, which were almost 2% of sales for the year. That\u2019s up 60% from 2017, as we invest to support the growth of our businesses, particularly Marine Systems and Aerospace. For 2019, we expect capital expenditures to rise to 3% of sales, driven by the continued investment in the Columbia Class program. Our free cash flow conversion rate for the quarter was 200% bringing our rate for the year to 78% excluding the discretionary pension contribution, and this is below our typical 100% conversion target. If you\u2019re following the headlines out of Canada, you know there are discussions taking place between the Canadian government and their customer on our armored vehicle supply contract. As a result of these discussions, we\u2019ve experienced payment delays that significantly impacted the free cash flow we expected last year. To be clear, this is a timing issue and we expect to receive the delayed payment this year. Assuming the resolution of this matter, we expect the cash conversion rate well in excess of 100% in 2019 and looking ahead, we expect cash performance throughout the planning horizon to be very strong in our typical 90% to 100% range. And one last point on backlog, we ended the year with total backlog of approximately $68 billion, that\u2019s up 7.5% over this time last year. That increase came in spite of a headwind from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which reduced the backlog by $840 million, $700 million of which impacted the Combat Systems Group. Beyond the firm backlog, our total potential contract value, which includes options and IDIQ arrangements, increased by an impressive 17.5% over the end of last year, including the multi-billion dollar CHS-5 IDIQ award admissions systems. In addition, we entered into a $1.1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer for a multi-year airplane, multi-year order that requires their board approval this quarter. Once approved, that order will move into the firm backlog. So these awards along with the firm backlog provide a nice foundation for the continued growth we see ahead. Howard, that concludes my remarks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard Rubel : Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Nicole, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Morning David. David Strauss : Phebe, can you, can you give us a little bit more detail on the on the IT guide. I understand, with the divestitures, you know that\u2019s a headwind on the top line, but you have one additional quarter of CSRA and in terms of the margin guide, I would have thought, we would have seen some margin improvement here given what\u2019s going on with intangible, amortization and additional synergies? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So let\u2019s talk a little bit about this business. In a growing environment last year, they had a one-to-one book-to-bill. They also have a 75% win rate and a $26 billion pipeline. This management team is performing the cost synergies beautifully, and frankly is a bit of ahead of schedule. By the way, this is a very energetic, innovative, management team that is really making GDIT into a workplace of preference. And in this market, people are absolutely critical and important across the board. But, people here truly matter. I might also add the cash performance on this business is outstanding. Last year, they generated over 100% percent of net income in cash and we\u2019ll continue that this year and for the years to come. So, so what we see this year? Despite that large backlog -- despite the large win rate and book-to-bill is this is simply a question of timing, when the contracts move from the backlog into sales. And you\u2019ll see the growth rate increase in the third quarter, fourth quarter and then significantly next year. This is just a question of the timing of several hundred contracts moving from backlog, into our sale. That also is impacting the margin rate. So I\u2019m very confident in the ability of this business to perform than outperform their cost synergy. They are growing great cash performance, so in the instance right now, it\u2019s simply a question of timing. Jason Aiken : And Dave, if you want me to, I\u2019ll add a little bit of additional color around your influence on margin rates. If you look at the 7.4% margin rate that we reported for the year for the group. If you normalize that for the amortization burden that came with the CSRA acquisition and take that out, you actually end up with a margin rate of 9.6% for the year. So that\u2019s a couple of hundred basis points better than we reported and about 110 basis points better than the year ago 2017 full year rate. That\u2019s really driven by the CSRA contribution from an operations perspective if you will. So they actually contributed approximately 10.9% incremental margins on the core business, excluding at amortization benefit. Now when you look ahead to next year, when you take the puts and takes on the revenue side between the additional quarter of CSRA volume offset by the divestitures were nominally up, let\u2019s just call it notionally flat, but nominally up. So even though we do have because of the accelerating amortization schedule that we have for this business, even though we do have a somewhat declining quarterly amortization burden, the fact that we have four full quarters of amortization versus a flattish to slightly nose knows up total top line is actually perhaps counter intuitively a little bit of a margin drag for next year. It will start to accelerate for the following year once we have a full up year-on-year comparison. So if you think about amortization, is really call it a 20 \u2013 I\u2019ll call the 20ish basis point drag. The other part of it is -- is we do have synergies as Phebe mentioned that are accelerating, so I\u2019d call that maybe an 80 basis point to 90 basis point assist, as we go forward and we\u2019ll continue to accelerate after that. And then from a mix perspective issue alluded to, when we talked about this for some time after the acquisition, we did forecast, call it 100 basis point to 150 basis point contraction overall in the incremental CSRA margins over the next 3, 4 years. So call it 50 basis points or so from that. So, if you take the 20ish basis points on amortization, if you call it 50 basis points on mix offset by a positive 80 basis point to 90 basis point improvement from synergies, you get call it 10 basis point to 20 basis point that improvement for the year, and we would see it accelerating after that. So, hopefully that color is helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace demand environment. This was the basing concerns out there about the global economy and whether that's had any flow-through to customer demand for your product in the last three months. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So I may pass that for you. Our North American demand is robust and growing. Western Europe is been -- it\u2019s been very active for us translating into addition to orders as well as considerable activity in our pipeline. I would say some of the emerging markets are a little bit more cautious. They tend to be focused on the 650 and on new products, but overall very very nice, very nice demand and interest in North America and Western Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein : Yes. Good morning. Another maybe follow up question quickly on Aerospace. When you compare this release to your last release last quarter, and you\u2019ll get the estimated potential contract value, it went up by almost a billion. Can you help us understand what that means and what gets thrown in that pile and why it would go up by a billion? Phebe Novakovic : Well let me ask Jason, to give you a little color on that. Jason Aiken : So Ron, one of the last comments that I made was around this area and it typically in the estimated potential contract value bucket for the defense businesses. That\u2019s clearly contract options and IDIQ potential value. For Aerospace, it holds a number of items to include options for aircraft as well as longer term arrangements that we have with individual customers. So where deliveries may be further out in the delivery queue and spread out in the backlog. So as I mentioned, we did have in the fourth quarter, a fairly large contract signed up with an existing commercial customer it was valued at just over a billion dollars. It\u2019s a multi aircraft, multi-year arrangement that spans out over several years that did not go into the firm backlog because that order is actually subject to that customer\u2019s board approval coming up later this quarter. So we expect that to happen this quarter, and we\u2019ll move into the firm backlog, and be counted as traditional orders at the time. But given the maturity of that and where it was in the quarter, that\u2019s why we put it in the as we typically are conservative on these notions, we put it in the potential contract value bucket versus in the firm backlog till we till we get to that firm order. Ronald Epstein : Okay great. And if I may do one follow up for Phebe. When you think about the current political environment and what that means for defense spending, and then how do you pass through that? It seems like there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty and volatility going on. So you know in your experience, how do you think about it? Phebe Novakovic : Well, some of the political contretemps haven\u2019t necessarily affected their defense spending if and in fact, defense spending has been increasing in this environment. So we are quite comfortable that we\u2019re going to see through our at least initial planning horizon, very nice funding for all of our key programs. So I haven\u2019t seen too much perturbation as a result of some of the extant issues with respect to the overall budget impacting defense. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Good morning Phebe or Jason. I wanted to see if we could dig a little bit more into the margin pressure you expect in the front end of 2019 and what you saw on the back end of 2018. How do we pass the pressure between the completion issues Phebe that you cited at Jet Aviation, just the general learning curve and conversions you\u2019re doing on five hundreds and six hundreds, and specifically NORDAM. Where does NORDAM factor into this, and how quickly do you get a lift as that problem diminishes? Phebe Novakovic : So let\u2019s take it in reverse order. We\u2019ve got on Nacelle line well under control, the cost performance has been quite good. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ve had to spool back up the supply chain. That is the pacing item with respect to our timing of our deliveries, but the supply chain is doing well and it\u2019s just going to take them a while to begin to have the capacity and the throughput and product to feed our demand. So I will see a little bit of slowness on that on the delivery in the south. But as we get into the second half, that will have completely resolved and we will be in full rate production throughout the supply chain. So we\u2019re quite pleased with that. The margin compression it has been something we\u2019ve been talking to you all for some time about. As you all know, the first lot of airplanes in this case, we\u2019re talking about the G500 carried very little margin. Those airplanes will ramp up, continue to ramp up that production and first quarter, second quarter as we move from that initial lot to carry those lower margins and you\u2019ll see some, we will see some margin expansion on that line. The 600 will come in at slightly higher entry margins, simply because of the disproportionate amount of test cost and on deep costs borne by the 500. And then we\u2019ll nicely come down its learning curve. So those are some of the issues that we would see with respect to the margins. The completion business, the jet we had a problem this year on really on the operating side. We have fixed that, and going forward, we\u2019re comfortable that they will do better this year. Robert Spingarn : So Jet is not really not part of the 2019 pressure? Phebe Novakovic : No, [Indiscernible]. No they\u2019re not. They will do better this year because of the affirmative and proactive steps they took in 2018. So you think -- much about mix. Robert Spingarn : Once you\u2019re through this year, do you recover to the old margins at Aerospace? Phebe Novakovic : We\u2019ll have, as we continue to come down on a learning curve. We finish up a lot of the 500, the first lot of 500 airplanes, the first flight of 600 airplanes; you can expect us to come quickly down our learning curve. And I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ll see some earnings and margin expansion in 2020 and then really quite nice expansion and considerable earnings growth thereafter, as we have completed all of those two transitions. So I\u2019m not going to predict exactly where we end up on new airplanes with respect to terminal margins here. But, you should expect us to continue the strong operating performance you have seen from us. We know how to build these airplanes, low cost high, quality provider. We're good at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could get some color on that Canadian Lab program that was weighing on the conversion this year, and you probably had maybe a billion of revenue on that program. I\u2019m curious, are you getting, are you getting any cash on the program an ongoing basis, and what would the conversion have looked like if not for the progress delays? Phebe Novakovic : So let me give you some context here Myles. This is a valid contract that all parties to that contract have repeatedly and recently attested to their commitment to honor that contract. The Canadian government fully understands the importance of our high end manufacturing and engineering talent in London, Ontario and the robust supply chain that we have throughout the country. Our payment issue got caught up in a larger international political issue diplomatic issue. That's why we got some payment last year. Those diplomatic contretemps affected, that slowed the payment that they would otherwise have anticipated. So that will resolve. It\u2019s a timing issue, and we\u2019re quite comfortable and quite confident that that will resolve just at a slower rate than we had anticipated. Myles Walton : In just about a breadbox around it, Jason would you have been above 90% adjusted for pension conversion if you get this? Jason Aiken : That\u2019s correct. We would have then call it net 95%, 200% range we\u2019ve been targeting. Operator : Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes. Phebe, I wanted to ask on Gulfstream. I thought, you\u2019d implied in the third quarter that the book-to-bill would get close to one. So if you just comment on what might have happened, so since we wound up somewhat less than that? Phebe Novakovic : I believe George what I said was that the orders would be better in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter. In fact, they were. And you know the book-to-bill was nice particularly I think. But when you look at the addition of delivery, a considerable number of additional deliveries that we added in the fourth quarter. But you know the quarterly book-to-bill, if you go back and looked at Gulfstream, Aerospace tends to have some lumpiness that we had very nice order activity last year, and the fourth quarter was about what we anticipated the orders would be better than the third quarter. And I would also point out that we\u2019ve got a, Jason talked about at some length, a billion dollar order with a customer that once it gets cleared by its board, moves into backlog. So I consider that, we had a good -- we had a good order quarter. George Shapiro : Okay. And then just could you quantify at all how much the incremental costs at NORDAM may have impacted the margin in the quarter? Phebe Novakovic : Now that\u2019s almost impossible to deconstruct. I\u2019m very pleased with how quickly we\u2019ve got some really good operators in Tulsa. And I\u2019m really pleased at how quickly they were able to stabilize the line. We\u2019ve got good performance, good cost control. And frankly, we\u2019ve got now aligned supply chain. Though, I don\u2019t know the any particular impact of that in with any specificity. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning all. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Carter. Carter Copeland : Phebe, just given where we are in the life cycle of the 650, I know historically you\u2019ve given us sort of a framework and how you think about products and their lifecycle and we just got the seventh anniversary of entry and a service on the 650. So I think we\u2019ll be halfway through that kind of 15 year life cycle that you usually reference in the next couple of quarters, and I wondered if you could just kind of update us on how you think about the lifecycle of that particular product as we look forward in this year. Phebe Novakovic : So I am -- as you can well imagine, not about comment on what our thinking is about new product introductions, but you can imagine that our pea-shooter is full, that\u2019s the way you ought to think about it. Carter Copeland : Okay, then I\u2019ll try another one. Jason, the comment on CapEx, just as we think about cash flow. When -- when do you see the Marine? I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you can answer this yeah just based on the planning. But, when should we think that the CapEx build in Marine sort of levels off from a longer term standpoint. Is that still a couple of years away? Jason Aiken : It is, its call it over the next couple of years two, between two and three years and then you\u2019ll see that tail back to a more normal level. So as I mentioned, over the more intermediate planning horizon, we do continue to see that. I think more reliable 90 to 90% to 100% cash conversion rate as a result. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes thank you very much. So, Phebe, I believe Mark Burns who runs a Gulfstream has said at some point you\u2019ll have a competitor to the global 70 500 in the market. And you obviously have an opportunity back where the 450 was. And, you obviously have probably taken a little bit longer than you expected on certifying the G600. So if we think about R&D, was that high in the fourth quarter -- higher -- high relatively high in the fourth quarter, and you know what, what comment can you give us in terms of what sort of a drag that will be on 2019? Phebe Novakovic : So let me just gently tease you a bit about not trafficking in what I call rumor intelligence or not. So with that cautionary note, our certification has come along quite nicely. As I told you, it\u2019s a little slower than we anticipated. You know this is a -- this is a detailed and appropriately robust process that unfortunately got impacted by the shut down and I apologize for my early optimism, but originally, in plan, our internal plan was first quarter and we think that, that because of that perturbations of the shutdown that\u2019s going to move into the second quarter. Jason will talk about the R&D. Jason Aiken : Yeah. Cai, the R&D for the quarter was essentially flat year-over-year. It was up a little bit sequentially from the third quarter if you go back and look at that data, call it by a roughly $20 million or so. I think for the year we ended up right around 1.5% of sales for total Company-sponsored R&D. So I don\u2019t think high or low in any anomalous way, and I think we expect to see, as we have in the past, a continued steady drip, and Phebe alluded to it on R&D, as we continue to -- the pipeline of new product introductions and technology introductions. So I don\u2019t think anything anomalous up or down. Cai von Rumohr : Got it. Thank you. Just a last quick one. Congratulations on your aggressive share repurchase in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that you carry your comparable opportunistic approach into this year? And would you legally have been able to buy any shares early in this quarter? Phebe Novakovic : You wisely have assumed that we will continue our opportunistic buying. And you -- I think you well know about the mechanism for share buybacks during the blackout. So I think we\u2019ll leave a comment around that later. But we were very active in the fourth quarter, I think that's the way to think about it. Howard Rubel : Operator, we have time for two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, just thinking about some of the good news that\u2019s going on in Marine, and just thinking back to your kind of your longer-term targets there, you\u2019ve had some really nice contract wins since those projections. So is this volume falling outside of that kind of scope for the 2020 targets? Or is this delivering you some additional upside, because it seems like you are tracking ahead of that. Just some additional color there would be great. Phebe Novakovic : So the proponents of the growth we are going to see is, is at Electric Boat and submarines. We\u2019ve gotten some nice wins at past. I think they\u2019ve got 11 DDG-51s in their backlog now, and they will continue to turn through those. NASSCO started its first containership Matson about two months early. They\u2019re working on the next oiler, and they\u2019ve got that extraordinarily versatile platform in the ESB. So they have done nicely with slow steady growth, but the real growth driver is Electric Boat. And you see that in two respects. Both on the \u2013 we\u2019ve got the Virginia class two-year volume in Block IV, and then Block V is a -- as I noted in my remarks, really a significant upgrade into the performance, and it is a let me just leave it at that. It is -- it will drive additional revenue, incremental revenue. And then the advent of the Columbia, which will begin early construction in next year. So this is a steady growth engine for us as we\u2019ve been saying for some time. I\u2019m very pleased with them. Operator : Our next question and our last question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Thank you for squeezing me on. Phebe, just another question on sort of product development. As you think about sort of the long-term and some lessons learned on the G650. You talked a lot about speed before as being an important value proposition to your new customers for these high-end products. Is there any sort of evolving sort of appetite for new capabilities beyond just speed, as you think about product development in the next 5 to 10 years? Is it like runway access, access to remote regions, anything like that? Or is it really just sort of like a speed concept to sort of the next value proposition? Phebe Novakovic : Speed is important, but as you can well imagine, we continue to upgrade and innovate around the avionics, cabin comfort, and the engines, both in fuel efficiency, decibel levels, and -- and look, these airplanes are getting better and better and better across the spectrum. Speed, for us, is an important commodity, because people\u2019s time is precious, so you\u2019re quite right, deposit, but that has been our focus, but it is by no means the single and exclusive focus. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator. With that we will end our call. If you -- if anybody has follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out and call me. My number is 703-876-3117. Thank you all again, and you can sign off. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks Howard and good morning all. Earlier today we reported earnings of $2.56 per diluted share and revenue just shy of $9.3 billion. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net income of $745 million. Revenue was up 23% against the first quarter of 2018 due in large part to the acquisition of CSRA However, without CSRA revenue was up an impressive 9.6% on a purely organic basis. In fact, there was organic revenue growth across all five operating segments.  EPS of $2.56 was $0.14 better than consensus, it would appear that revenue was some $400 million higher than anticipated by the sell - side and operating earnings were up about $40 million higher. Operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion were just ahead of the year-ago result despite modest declines at aerospace, marine and combat systems. The result benefited from the combination of CSRA with GDIT.  The operating margin of 10.9% in the quarter was good, it did not compare favorably last year's stellar first quarter of 13.4% which was before the inclusion of amortization from CSRA transaction. Net earnings were down $54 million over the same quarter in 2018. Higher interest expense, somewhat higher taxes were the cause of lower net income. It follows that earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.09 below the first quarter 2018, a 3% drop. Apart from the impressive revenue growth, an important part of the story in the quarter was order intake and growth in backlog. Total backlog grew to $69.2 billion, an increase of $1.34 billion compared to the end of last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the book-to-bill for the company was an impressive 1.2. Broken down into 1.1 to 1 for defense and 1.4 to 1 for aerospace. So let me discuss each group and provide some color where appropriate. First, aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.2 billion was $450 million, or 22.7% ahead of the year ago period. This is attributable in large part to the delivery of seven G500 in the quarter and a solid increase in service revenue. The moderately lower operating earnings were related to the mix shift at Gulfstream from the delivery of the G500. These planes carry the burden of the test program and retrofits as we previously advised. Margins on the aircraft will improve markedly through the year. At year-end, we had indicated that aerospace margins for the first two quarters would be in the mid 14% range, up somewhat from the 14.1% rate in the final period of 2018. Jason Aiken : Thank you. Phebe and good morning. Net interest expense in the quarter was $117 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments on one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. Our free cash flow of negative $976 million was impacted by the payment delays and as we've discussed previously, this is a timing item. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $181 million in the quarter were up about 75% from the year ago quarter as we invest in our shipyards to support the significant growth that is on the horizon. We still expect this year to be the peak at approximately 3% of revenues and returning to the 2% range thereafter. In the quarter, we paid $268 million in dividends and we spent $86 million on the repurchase of 525,000 of our shares. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercise of employee stock options. Otherwise, we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $673 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $12.9 billion. Our effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, which is consistent with our full year tax rate guidance. As Phebe noted, order activity and backlog were particularly strong story in the quarter, as four of our five segments posted a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even as we grew almost 10% organically. On that note, I think it bears a reminder that not all companies report book-to-bill on the same basis. We calculate this measure based on the firm backlog as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles excluding the value associated with IDIQ contracts. That's of course most relevant to Mission Systems in GDIT, each of which had a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater, even under the more conservative GAAP definition. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Jamie, would you please remind participants, how to enter the queue. Operator :  Our first question today comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. DougHarned: Yes, good morning, thanks. Hi, I wanted to -- if we get a little better understanding on the margin trajectory at Gulfstream, you talked before in the last quarter about the lower margins to beginning of the year and likely very attractive margins when you get out to Q4. Could you give us a sense of what's behind that trajectory and are those higher margins at the end of the year? Are those the sort of normal margins that we might expect going forward beyond this year? PhebeNovakovic: And as I said in my remarks, the margin rate is largely attributable to the mix and as we've talked about fairly frequently, that mix is driven by the increased deliveries on the G500, which carry lower margin in that first accounting lot, but we're going to be through that in the second quarter. And look, I think we've been pretty, quite transparent about this change in mix. We'll work our ways through it, as we deliver more G500s and the G600s will enter into service all with good margin. So when I think about it, our margins will improve throughout the year and as we go into next year our performance will get even better and better. As yet -- we hit full-rate production on the G500 and G600 and continue to come down our learning curves. DougHarned: And then when you get out there in the G500 and G600 are mature, is it possible to give us a sense of how you might think about that between for the G550 mature margins and G650 mature margins? Where were the G500 and G600 shakeout? PhebeNovakovic: Well, the G650, nothing's going to come close to that for I think all the reasons you understand. But it is our expectation that the G500 and G600 surpass the G450 and G550 peak margins. They are built and purpose-built facilities that are coming down, straight line and we have over that time continued to perfect our manufacturing processes. So I -- when we are up, we're really, really running. I think we're going to be better than those two legacy airplanes. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. RobertStallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe, just to start off with Aerospace. You noted the good demand for the G650 in the quarter. Are you still going to stick with your plan to gradually ease G650 deliveries over time? PhebeNovakovic: Yes. So a little bit this year, and then more in next year and the following year when G500s and G600s are in -- as I say, full-rate production with good margins. RobertStallard: Okay. And then as a follow-up on GDIT, you noted a good book-to-bill in the quarter. How sustainable do you think this is? And what's the expected conversion of that book-to-bill to revenues over time? PhebeNovakovic: Well, when we put something in firm backlog, it's pretty sure conversion into revenue. But let me give you a little bit of context to it. I think it helps to understand. So GDIT in the quarter at 1.1 to 1 book-to-bill and over the last four quarters as I mentioned in my remarks they add 1 to 1. Now their win rate, they have demonstrated a win rate consecutively over those last four quarters between 70% and 75%. Against Dow's performance indicator, you've got a budget that is growing by 5%. So, I think this business is in very good stead for continued growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. RonaldEpstein: Hey. Good morning. Maybe a bigger, excuse me, a bigger strategic question. How are you thinking about Mission Systems? Right. I mean, their performance in the quarter was pretty good. And how do you think about growing that or it seems like it's sub-scale right now, right. Do you grow it? Do you sell it? What do you do with it, I mean, when you think about it? PhebeNovakovic: So, given its portfolio, I don't believe that it's sub-scale. If you think about what they really are is, they are systems integrators with a significant products business. They've got some long-term franchise programs, a number of them and those programs are growing. So I like where they are, they've got some unique positioning, in fact, best-of-class position in a number of areas, in network security, cyber protection, accuracy and position, navigation in a GPS environment, integration of systems on the ballistic missile class submarines and the fire control system. So they assist something. These are programs that they've had for a long, long time, all of which are on the growth trajectories. So, I don't really see them as sub-scale. And again, their margins are really quite nice. This is a good operating leverage company. I think they play nicely in the space therein, and we're quite comfortable with this. RonaldEpstein: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-on in Aerospace. Can you say when is the next available delivery slot for G650? PhebeNovakovic: Yes, I'm not getting into that anymore, so we're really not tracking it that way. We've got a whole lot of new airplanes coming on. So those individual metrics become little less meaningful, but you need to think about what's really unusual and unique about the Gulfstream portfolio, as we have a family now of all brand new airplanes and when I say brand new, they are clean sheet, you know that better than anybody what that means, from scratch all new, nobody else has that, and that family is compelling, and we're seeing that in our consistent demand. Operator : Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead with your question. GeorgeShapiro: Yes, good morning. On the Gulfstream, Phebe, are we seeing the trend for orders continue were strong in the second quarter here? PhebeNovakovic: So we're off to a good start, but undergirding this, you raise -- undergirding your question is really a -- I think more robust demand question. And like I think I'll take this opportunity to help us think about demand a little bit more holistically. It's kind of folly to try to address demand prospectively. It's a little bit easier from a retrospective point of view, as long as one's not too myopic about the data. So what does the data tell us? That the market for Gulfstream airplane has been good over the last 12 months at a period of ramped up deliveries.  The book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.5 to 1 at Gulfstream and almost 1.1 to 1 for the trailing 12 months. This tells me that we're in a period of solid, but not overheated demand. And I see nothing in the data available to me at the moment that suggests a change in that picture. So that's how you ought to think about, as we go through the year, our expectations about the demand environment. GeorgeShapiro: And then just a quick one on Marine. The revenues were somewhat less than I would have thought given the guidance of up 6% for the year and the margin was somewhat better. As we get increased revenues throughout the year, do we have the opportunity that the margin turns out to be higher than your 8.5%? PhebeNovakovic: Well, look we'll always work towards improved margins. But remember the revenue is simply a question of timing and mix. And as we move from the Block III to Block IV, we have accounted for those margin changes as we see in every -- by the way we see this and you know this and every one of our transition from one block to the other, because we bid down a continuous learning curve and we have a -- each one of our contracts has the same sort of target profit. And on a share lines, so we always give back some of that goodness appropriately. So did the U.S. Navy, but what does that mean?  That means we've got to drive our operating performance relentlessly and continuously and we've done that now for 20 years. So, we will work very hard to consolidate and accelerate our learning on the Block IV, but at the moment we're pretty comfortable with the guidance we gave you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. DavidStrauss: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, want to try and put a finer point on GDIT. I think publicly it's been said that while '18 and '19 a relatively flat from a revenue standpoint that the '18 to 2020 kind of growth rate, you're still looking for is mid-single digits, is that correct? PhebeNovakovic: Yes. And I don't think we've given you a whole lot of specificity about '20, but I tried to set some context to how to think about this growth profile. With that win rates, with the increasing budget and post-acquisition book-to-bill, we're in a very good place. So I look at this business as long-term good growth. In that budget it was about $100 billion, their addressable market budget is about $120 billion, 5% increase, almost 5% increase. That's pretty darn impressive. Good opportunities there. DavidStrauss: Thanks. As a follow-up, Jason. Any quantification you can give on what the drag was in Q1 from the delay on the international side and any sort of idea around timing? I know you're expecting to reverse this year, but are this more of a second half item that you're looking for? Thanks. JasonAiken: Yes, so the amount that continue to push to the right, I think of it as a roughly $1 billion, David, that's what we're talking about. It's lapsed over from last year and continues to push to the right. PhebeNovakovic: And I think it's important to understand that these are negotiations between two sovereign powers, that are progressing, but they're very, very sensitive, as all of diplomatic negotiations are. Progress is good, but slow. We do anticipate it resolving this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question. CaivonRumohr: Yes, thank you so much. So Phebe, I thought I heard you say that the Gulfstream 500 would move into the second production block in the second quarter. If that's the case, how come the margins aren't better than the first? PhebeNovakovic: I think second half is what I said. CaivonRumohr: Second half, excuse. PhebeNovakovic: Yes. So I mean that's the inference from us being through that first block right, and we'll get through that in this quarter and get into the second lot in the second quarter. So, you're right. CaivonRumohr: Got it. So GDIT obviously, you're looking for pretty good bookings. It's kind of we look around, there are several very large competitions for competitor programs in the network space, GSM-O and NextGen are, how in terms of looking at your expected growth do you factor those? Because obviously you have other competitors and if you win, things are going to be a lot better and if you lose, they won't be as good as you're projecting. So how do you factor them? PhebeNovakovic: So if you think about us and you know us and you've known us for years. We are conservative, when we look at opportunities. We give healthy discount rates, I think that are a good thing to do for internally for the business and the forecast and guidance that we issue reflects that, those discounted rates. So the beauty of a business with 7,000 contracts is that frankly no one is positive. But I'm comfortable that they'll win their fair share. That said, we've approached this -- their pipeline through -- looking through a conservative prism. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. PeterArment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe, first question on Combat I guess, you mentioned some very positive comments regarding the fiscal '20 funding levels for some of the core platforms. I guess maybe just in the context of longer-term growth, how you're thinking about how those programs are shaping up domestically? And then what some of the international opportunities that you're pursuing are for that could supplement that growth? Thanks. PhebeNovakovic: Sure. So the U.S. Army is recapitalizing, after the hot wars, they have utilized a lot of their equipment and as their budget slowed down rather precipitously, they did not have the resource to go and recapitalized, but they do now and that's exactly what they're doing. So they're modernizing their existing fleet in addition to developing new potential platforms. And we -- that existing fleet is our program, right. Stryker and Abrams have seen considerable increases in their budget funding lines because the Army needs those vehicles. The Abrams remains an outstanding tank and the upgrade in the version 4, is really not your father's Abram. It is a more capable, more survivable, more lethal system as is the Stryker. So we think those twp core franchise programs for us are in very, very good stead. We work very closely with our Army customer to understand their demands and their requirements and how they think about the war fighter and so we position ourselves in our investment dollars and also, thinking about the art of the possible for them and how we can help them meet their objectives. That's certainly true on the franchise programs. I've just talked about, but also on new programs, what is in the art of the possible what's doable how fast you can do it and what it is going cost you. And the key there is to have the trust of the Army customer, who believes that the estimates that you give them are reliable. So we've had a -- we are very aligned with our Army customer, know where they're headed. And I frankly like everything that I see here. And that's on the big vehicle programs, when I look at ammunition business, ammunition business is growing. I think we grew 10% in the quarter. And we've had our book-to-bill, there that's been very wholesome because as we increase our operational training tempo, our munitions and armaments will increase demands. So outside the United States, in North America, outside of the United States we see some recapitalization in the UK and Canada, where we have decade's long presence in both of those countries, throughout NATO and heavily in Eastern European. The world is getting a more dangerous place and unfortunately, but that is -- that creates demand for our products. Our European Land Systems has multiple opportunities throughout the Former Soviet Border States and Eastern Block and domestically and elsewhere. So you know threats drive funding and they drive the need for requirements and unfortunately we live in a world have increased threat. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. SheilaKahyaoglu: Good morning and thank you for the time, everyone, good quarter. Just a bigger picture question, I mean revenues were up I think 23% this quarter and profit was sort of flattish. How do we think about that inflection and profit growth in excess of revenue growth and timing of that and any maybe impediments to that that you see. PhebeNovakovic: So let's break the businesses into two distinct factors. Aerospace, I think we've just given you a pretty fulsome and I going to walk you through that again, pretty fulsome explanation of the margin compression. And on the defense side, it's really about mix. When you're growing and you've got new contracts coming in, and you've got older contracts closing, you're going to have the mix issues and we frankly because all of our defense businesses are growing we have some of that right now. So that will resolve in continuing throughout the year and then into the future years as we get -- one thing you can absolutely rely on us for is superb operating performance. We are very good at improving what we control and we control our own operations. So you can expect us to get better and better and better as time goes by. SheilaKahyaoglu: Thanks. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up, I think you mentioned $1 billion contract in Aerospace last quarter, was that booked? PhebeNovakovic: I'm sorry, where? SheilaKahyaoglu: You mentioned in Aerospace $1 billion contract with an existing corporate customer, was that booked in the quarter? PhebeNovakovic: Right. So I couldn't hear you out. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question. CarterCopeland: Good morning Phebe, Jason and Howard. Just two quick ones. One on the assumed certification on the G600 Phebe, do you think there's any risk there, just given the extra scrutiny and -- on things like ODA and what not, given the incident elsewhere in the industry, just -- I wonder if you could share any thoughts on that and just help give us some color, if there's any risk? PhebeNovakovic: So, first the FAA and as we're targeting late June, but they've got a pretty rigorous process, so that may slip a week -- a couple of weeks or so, but I think importantly that does not impact our deliveries, which is really, I think the key underlying question. We have, not seen any new regulations or any new changes and the FAA oversight. So, we work very closely with them. Frankly, their partners and ensuring that we deliver base airplanes efficiently, and so they've got an additional workload, but so far haven't really seen much of an impact. CarterCopeland: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up. I noted the comments you made in the prepared remarks, around the cost progress on the missiles and the quality there, and obviously there's some uncertainty and risk when you took that work on, is there in your view the opportunity to maybe favorably retire some of that risk that you had foreseen as you continue to make progress and is this an indication maybe you're headed in that direction? PhebeNovakovic: So cost is increasingly under control. The schedules, we de-risked a lot of the schedules. We're getting a lot of input from the manufacturing workforce, which will help us optimize our production, and again we're very, very good at manufacturing. So a lot of that risk is definitely behind us and it's going to get better. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. SethSeifman: Thanks very much and good morning. So I wanted to follow up on question that Peter asked earlier about the Combat business and when we look at the budgets that have come out for Abrams over the past couple of years and what's being requested for 2020. It's kind of in $2 billion-ish range, which seems like it's probably at least 2x, if not more what the Abram sales were last year. I mean should we be expecting Abrams sales over the next couple of years to advance to this level. PhebeNovakovic: You should expect them to advance. Think about it this way, for a while that in the period where the Army funding was seriously constrained, that tank plant was producing one tank a month. At the end of this year, we'll be rolling out 30 tanks a months by the end of this year. So that obviously will drive revenue growth and that backlog increase translates 1 to 1 in the revenue. SethSeifman: All right. And then just a follow-up 1.1, when we think about a point that you guys have made consistently in the past, is the impact of a mix shift towards domestic production on profitability in combat. Is that primarily an Abrams issue? Because you mentioned some -- that there's growth in Stryker, there's growth on the weapons and munition side. Is that primarily an Abram issue? PhebeNovakovic: So there are two things. There is mix between domestic and international. And there's also the mix issue driven by older contracts and newer ones coming on board. So as Abram ramps up, remember we're also doing the mobile protective firepower. We were one of the two down select and so those -- again, we've got to move down our learning curve and that will ensue the performance over time. HowardRubel: And operator, we'll just take one more question, please. Operator : And our final question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question . MylesWalton: Thanks. Good morning. And Phebe, I'm curious, could you reflect on the certification process for the G500, G600 and how maybe it would influence your thinking of the next new aircraft? How you kind of publicly launch it versus privately launch it? Should we expect kind of timelines from public launch to anticipated EIS to maybe be a little bit shorter as you do more of the certification work behind the curtain? PhebeNovakovic: Myles, if I told you any of that, that is just proprietary, but of -- listen, you would expect us to have lessons learned from everything we do. These have been extraordinarily successful developmental programs as these have been an extraordinarily successful test program. These airplanes are beating all of their design performance specifications. So we will continue to work closely with our FAA customer and it will continue to refine our processes going forward. But when we announce anything or how we announce that just sensitive. MylesWalton: Okay. And Jason a clarification, the $1 billion push to the right, you mentioned on the Canadian LAV contract for Saudi. I think in the K, you've said $1.9 billion of unbilled receivables. Curious, can you kind of square those two and also the size of the current unbilled receivable? Thanks. JasonAiken: Sure. So the balance between the two is basically the contract work in process. It's ongoing as you'd expect on any contract of this size. So that really is the delta there. And you'll see in the 10-Q we published later today that $1.9 billion that was reported at the end of the year is now up to $2.2 billion. End of Q&A Howard Rubel : Operator. Thank you very much. Prior to the close, I'd like to first thank everybody for joining us today. And then secondarily, as a reminder, we refer you to our website for both the first quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll close today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics\u2019 Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. As you can discern from our press release, we enjoyed a very good second quarter with revenue of $9.56 billion and net earnings of $806 million. We reported EPS at $2.77 per diluted share, $0.15 a share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.09 per share better than consensus. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $369 million or 4%. This is as reported, but organic growth was higher after taking into account the effect of divestitures at GDIT and the acquisition of Hawker Pacific. Remember that divestitures at GDIT provided some of more than $250 million per quarter in revenue. Net earnings of $806 million were up $20 million or 2.5% on a modest improvement of operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher interest expense. Sequentially, revenue was up $294 million or 3.2% and operating earnings were up $76 million or 7.5% on higher operating margins. With respect to consensus, revenue in the quarter was about $200 million more and the operating margin rate was 10 basis points higher than forecasted by the sell side. In short, $0.08 of the $0.09 beat was provided by stronger operating earnings. Let me turn very briefly to the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. Revenue was up $2.1 billion or 12.5% against the first half of 2018 driven by strong organic growth plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. In other words, CSRA revenue was not reflected in the first quarter's results last year. On the other hand, operating earnings were up only $8 million, burdened by the amortization related to the CSRA acquisition. EPS was $0.06 better. In short, we had a very good second quarter, good sequential improvement, and a good first half. We are somewhat ahead of both our internal operating plan and external expectations. So, let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then ask Jason for some comments before I give you some insight into our outlook for the business and each segment for the remainder of the year. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $119 million versus $103 million in the second quarter of 2018. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $236 million versus $130 million for the same period last year. The increase in 2019 is due to the debt we issued to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We're also carrying more commercial paper than anticipated due to delayed payments related to one of our large international vehicle programs in Canada. At this point we expect the interest expense for 2019 to be approximately $460 million. Our cash from operations of $291 million in the quarter was also impacted by these payment delays. As we've discussed previously this is a timing item. With respect to the outstanding receivable balance, we were recently told by the customer that we will receive considerable funding next month. We continue to expect to resolve the balance of the arrears by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year, we still expect full year free cash flow conversion will be well in excess of 100% of net income. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures were $181 million in the quarter or approximately 2% of revenues. Assuming receipt of the outstanding payments I just noted consistent with the timing I described, we still expect our capital expenditures to reach approximately 3% of revenues for the year, reflecting the investment in our shipyards to support the significant growth that's on the horizon. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, bringing the rate for the first half to 18.3% consistent with our expectations for the full year. In the quarter, we paid $295 million in dividends and we spent approximately $100 million on the repurchase of 575,000 of our shares. That brings the total for the first half to 1.1 million shares for $184 million. We plan to acquire enough shares in 2019 to ensure there is no dilution from the exercised employee stock options. Otherwise we anticipate deploying the balance of our free cash flow this year to pay down our short-term borrowings. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $702 million on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $13.2 billion. We expect to repay our outstanding commercial paper balance by the end of this year and our first tranche of fixed and floating rate notes matures in the second quarter of next year. I'll wrap up with a few points of color on the backlog and our order activity in the quarter. We had another solid quarter with respect to orders. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $67.7 billion. That's up 2% over this time a year ago and the total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $102 billion, up 3% over a year ago. As Phebe mentioned, GDIT posted a particularly strong quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.24 times and I'll remind you that, that does not include over $2.5 billion in IDIQ awards in the quarter which as you know we don't include in backlog or our book-to-bill calculations. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks Jason. So, turning to our outlook for the year. Let me provide our forecasts for the year for each segment compared to what we told you in January and then wrap it into our EPS guidance. For Aerospace, our guidance was to expect revenue of $9.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from 2018; operating earnings around $1.5 billion; and an operating margin around 15.5%. We now expect revenue of $9.95 billion with earnings of $1.525 billion with an operating margin of 15.3%. The increased revenue comes largely from increased preowned sales and modest mix shift. Earnings will be up on improved operating performance, but the margin rate will be diluted by preowned aircraft sales. For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, up $260 million to $360 million from 2018 with operating earnings in the range of $965 million to $975 million. We now expect revenue of $6.8 billion and operating earnings of approximately $1 billion. The more revenues drives $25 million to $35 million and more operating earnings. For the Marine Group, we've previously guided to our revenue of $9 billion, margins of around 8.5%, and operating earnings of $770 million. We see no reason to change that guidance, although my bias would be very nominally lower. For Mission Systems, we've previously provided an outlook for this year of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion with margins in the mid to high 13% range. This implied an operating earnings of around $660 million. We now anticipate revenue of $5 billion, operating earnings around $690 million, with operating margins of around 13.8%. For Information Technology, we guided to revenue of $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 7.5%. We now expect revenue of $8.5 billion and operating earnings of $630 million, with an operating margin of 7.4%, 10 basis points lower. So all of this sums to revenues for General Dynamics of about $39.2 billion and operating earnings of around $4.6 billion. Compared to our initial guidance, we will have both higher revenue and operating earnings. This permits us to increase our EPS outlook from a range of $11.60 to $11.70 to a range of $11.85 to $11.90. As for the quarterly progression, it appears to us that the third quarter will be $0.30 better than the second quarter. Howard, we can now take some questions. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator :  Today\u2019s first question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe the Aerospace division, one of your peers noted that their customers took a bit of a strike in May and June with concerns over the economy and tariffs and I was wondering if you saw anything like that at Gulfstream? Phebe Novakovic : No. Robert Stallard : That was pretty straightforward. Phebe Novakovic : Look we have continued to have nice order activity. Our pipeline remains robust. As I think I have explained to many of you before, you need to look at the business aviation market, not only by cabin size but really by OEM because our experience in the marketplace is very different from others. So we continue to have good order activity throughout each of the months in the quarter. Robert Stallard : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein : Yeah, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Ron. Ronald Epstein : Just to follow on to Rob's question. I mean, can you kind of walk through the demand environment you're seeing across the different products you have at Gulfstream 650, 600, 500, 280? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So the 650 continues to have very solid demand. I think by the end of this quarter we had 370 in service. It continues to have performance characteristics unmatched by anyone else any other aircraft and it continues to enjoy some very nice solid demand. The 600 has had very good demand. We suspect as we saw that the 500 when we start delivering these airplanes that is the catalyst for incremental demand increases and I have every confidence that that will also increase. 500 continues nicely and the 280 has had good sales but a little bit more episodic that end of the market tends to be that way. But on our big key platforms, airplanes, we\u2019ve continued to have good activity. Ronald Epstein : And then as a follow-on question, have you seen any blowback in the Chinese market regarding the potential sale of Abrams to Taiwan? Because there were some stuff in the Chinese press about it. I'm not sure if it's just kind of press noise or if there's some reality there? Phebe Novakovic : As far as I know, no tank sales have actually occurred. But let me remind everyone how this works. This is an FMS case or any FMS case. The U.S. Army buys our tanks and sells them to other foreign nations in this case potentially Taiwan. I'd say that that we've had fairly muted demand in that market for a while now, and I suspect that tariffs have had some dampening effect but the pipeline is increasingly active and we've been quite comfortable on where we are. Ronald Epstein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, David. David Strauss : Hey. Phebe, so on the G500 it looks like deliveries in the quarter based on the 21 that you said have been delivered so far. It looks like deliveries were pretty light in the quarter on G500. Maybe I expected the margin to be better because of that. Can you just talk about that and if you\u2019re through the first block that's below margin G500 deliveries at this point? Phebe Novakovic : So, we had a bit of catch-up in Q1 right after the -- after the 2018 certification. And frankly this is simply a timing issue and we are continuing to come down our learning curves. Our margin performance is better on each and every airplane that comes down -- and down our line. So, this is simply in the moment a timing issue that we had a bit of a backlog in Q1 and we're through that and we're entering into really steady state. David Strauss : Okay. And then for my follow-up, on GDIT, it looks like based on your updated guidance, you're still expecting organically ex the divestitures relatively flat in the second half of the year. When do we start to see this strong booking rate that you've highlighted come through in terms of actual organic growth of that business? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : By 2020, as we said before this is in a transition year for us and a positioning for growth year and all of the indicators of growth are there. So, we are pretty confident that next year is going to realize some of those that increased backlog. Operator : Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hello, thanks very much and good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Morning. Seth Seifman : I just want to ask a little bit about the cadence of EPS not that it matters that much, I mean the guidance is out, but just in terms of what you had thought in January has kind of a very heavy fourth quarter and it seems like the EPS that had been in the second half cadence back in January, did some of that show up in the first half? Phebe Novakovic : Somewhat, but our guidance is really -- so you think about it. The real story undergirding the update in the guidance is we've got more revenue with similar margin performance leading to higher earnings. So, when we give you our update mid-year, we guided the result of careful ops reviews and we have very considered guidance that looks at all -- and considers all the risk and opportunities and we tend to narrow our range and have a certain amount of precision, but I'd say the overarching story is more revenue higher earnings. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. And just in Combat, in terms of if there were kind of specific platforms that drove the increase in the guide and, kind of, was there a meaningful amount of FX that you had to offset on the P&L just to be able to raise the guide by that $30 million? Phebe Novakovic : Not on the P&L with respect to FX. This is simply continuing to come down our learning curves on the domestic programs that we now have and are increasing and then it's the velocity of the domestic program vehicles as we increase our manufacturing capacity. So that's really the undergirding. It's all a story about domestic right now in the U.S. Army. Seth Seifman : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : Jason on the free cash flow, I was wondering if it's maybe kind of worthwhile to bridge from this year to next year just on the bigger pieces just because I think I heard you say the Canadian labs payments coming in the back half of this year take you to 100% free cash to net income conversion this year, so it would imply still below 100% conversion without those payments assuming -- I know CapEx is still albeit, I'm assuming there's other working capital happen. So can we kind of -- can you help us bridge 2019 to 2020? Or is it actually just as simple as it starts clipping 100% conversion pretty clean beyond this year? Jason Aiken : Yeah, I think if you isolate to catching up on the arrears on the international program this year, we had previously indicated and still are of the position that this year and frankly the years looking forward are in the 95 -- 90%, 95%, 100% conversion range on a pretty steady basis, fluctuating in that range based on CapEx investments and things like that. So really this one timing item and the resolution of that item is what causes the anomaly, it caused the anomaly last year. And I think to put a little bit more precision on the outlook for this year is if we get fully caught up this year, we would expect to be nicely in excess of 100%. So I think that may be reconciles a little bit of the math you were thinking about. But to your point beyond this year we're really -- we expect to be consistently in the range of 90% to 100% conversion year-on-year subject to some fluctuations with CapEx and other investments like that. Noah Poponak : Got it. And then Phebe just going back to Gulfstream, can you speak to what pricing has been like in your recent order activity, better, worse or the same and what that means for margin improvement in the business going forward? Phebe Novakovic : Well, as you can imagine, we're very sensitive about discussing pricing, but you can well imagine that we continue to enjoy the pricing that we've seen recently in our business and on each of our platforms. Operator : And our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yeah thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe Novakovic : Hi. Jason Aiken : Good morning. Peter Arment : Phebe on GDIT, it sounds \u2013 it\u2019s great, it sounds like the integration is tracking ahead of your planning and given that we're seeing the 1.2 book-to-bill you saw this quarter, do you characterize this as kind of -- you're picking up share gains? Or is it just the environment with all the spending? Just maybe some color on what you're seeing there? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So for those of you who have known us for a while, we never track share. That can be a fool\u2019s errand. You can have an awful lot of share and go broke. So what we're really looking for is how we have built our pipeline; our win rates, which since the acquisition have been about 75 -- 74% to 75% on recompetes about 90% very strong at least 1 :1 book-to-bill since the acquisition and we've been building -- we've been building that backlog with programs that we think we can execute quite effectively and quite efficiently. Let's talk a little bit about what GDIT is. You know, this is a people business and the way you attract people is by establishing a superior culture with very clear career development opportunities and some very interesting work. We have done quite well on that side in my mind and that I think undergirds this really quite impressive performance that this management team has exhibited since the acquisition. And again, just to give you a size and scope and complexity of this business, you know, on the first half we submitted almost $24 billion in proposals and that was more than the entire submittals in 2018. And for the remainder of the year and the second half we're looking at about $27 billion proposals. We submitted about 350 proposals just in terms of numerically in the second quarter and then -- and about 560 -- or 650 in the first half. So that tells you that what you need to undergird that kind of execution in proposals and velocity in submittals. And the win -- and the resultant win rate you need a very, very strong management team undergirded by the culture and the people that I've just talked about. And I'm very pleased with where we are right now. We are doing very well with GDIT. Peter Arment : Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe. Operator : And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes. Thank you very much. So Phebe, could you give us some color in terms of the lead times at Gulfstream particularly for the G650 and 280? Phebe Novakovic : So as we've been transitioning to new aircraft we're no longer following individual plane lead times. But let me tell you all of our wait times are comfortably within the range of 1 year to 18 months and that's across our portfolio. So I'm good with that. I think that's the way you think about it and we have continued to perform quite nicely and hit our -- hit comfortable lead times in each of our legacy airplanes as well as our new ones. So we're really just managing to the orders and the demand. And we did well I think. Cai Von Rumohr : Okay. Terrific. Great. Thank you. And then at GDIT you've given us the bid submits. Can you tell us at mid-year how much of -- what's the number for bids awaiting decision over the remainder of the year? And maybe give us some color some of the potential pursuits like GSMO and next gen? Phebe Novakovic : So I don't actually know the timing and award decisions, given all the input that is really idiosyncratic to the individual customer, but I think one of the reasons I wanted to share with you the velocity of contracts and the enormity of the velocity of proposals and the enormity of the proposals, to give you a sense that we do not track and I don't think about this business in terms of any particular pursuits. And many of the pursuits you happen to mention are in our competitive space, so we\u2019re certainly not going to talk about that. But I think that both the size and velocity of the submissions give you a real sense of this is a big business with a lot of moving parts. And frankly I don't worry about any one particular program. Cai Von Rumohr : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead. Phebe Novakovic : Myles? Operator : Hello, Myles, your line is open. Myles Walton : Sorry about that. Good morning. Jason I was wondering if you could first maybe clarify on the payment you expected next month or just give a rough size of the burden at hand you have there. Would you get to full conversion for the year if that one came through? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think -- listen these are very -- I think we said all we're going to say about where we are right now on that program. As you can well imagine these are sensitive tripartite conversations and we've told you where, we're making nice progress and let's just leave it at that. Myles Walton : Okay. Maybe a follow-up then. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, go ahead. Myles Walton : The Marine Group, Phebe, you mentioned on the Marine Group that you weren\u2019t changing the guidance that your bias was nominally lower, I just wanted to clarify was that lower on the margin or on the topline? Phebe Novakovic : I think I said very -- nominally lower. So, listen I am in a big business that has a number of moving parts. I'm very sensitive particularly when we have new starts and we have a number of new starts, primarily at our West Coast shipyard and that plus we may see depending on the Navy needs, we may see additional material come in this year and that tends to carry a lower margin. So, I'm just at the absolute -- let's say very nominally I want -- condition that there's two things that we don't have as much clarity about as we typically do in any given quarter and so that's why I gave you that -- ever so-mild caveat. Myles Walton : Yes, I know. I was just clarifying because it looked like revenue was running ahead, so that makes sense on the margin. Thanks Phebe. Operator : And our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Pete Skibitski : Hey, good morning guys. Phebe what's your view as you look at this two-year budget deal that's kind of shaped up this week for 2021. How do you think about the Navy\u2019s ability to afford the Columbia class or for the potential for that program to crowd out other ship priorities or other programs for \u2013 if we are going to go into a flattening, kind of, environment? Phebe Novakovic : Well, it\u2019s certainly very good news that it looks like we've got some clarity in our political landscape at the moment. Listen, let's talk about Columbia for a moment. Columbia is a national priority and I have no doubt that as a national priority funding will be made available for it. There are a lot of different ways to do that from a budget perspective and I think that the U.S. Congress and our customer is talking about various avenues of ways to ensure healthy budgeting. I'll tell you back when we did the Ohio in the 80s a separate account was set up. That's a potential option. So I don't worry too much about Columbia crowding other programs out. There is an imperative for the Navy to recapitalize its ships and build more ships. There is a consensus in Washington across political spectrum, at least political parties -- leadership in the major political parties that understand that we need ships and we need to replace the under seed light of the deterrent. And So I'm comfortable that the Department of Defense working with the Congress will find appropriate funding mechanisms to address what you have raised. Pete Skibitski : Got it. Just as a follow-up what's the reason behind the -- at a higher pre-owned volumes this year at Gulfstream? Is that --- just a really active market? Or maybe this year is just an anomaly in terms of initial 600 customers or something like that? Phebe Novakovic : There is nothing in particular. On occasion we'll have a bit more pre-owned but it signifies nothing. Pete Skibitski : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Hey. Good morning, guys. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Carter. Jason Aiken : Good morning. Carter Copeland : Just a quick clarification and question. I had in my notes that Maximus was like a $900 million impact on the organic calculation, but I think you said 250 plus. Phebe, I just wondered if you would clarify that for us. And then just wondering now that you've gotten certification at Aerospace on the two new airplanes if you expect -- R&D to be a little bit more stable I know you had a comparison in the quarter that caused a little bit year-over-year variability, but should we expect that to be a little bit more steady in the future than we've seen in the last several quarters? Phebe Novakovic : So me -- let's answer that in inverse order. As we move the test airplanes from the test program in the customer set you'll see some reduction in R&D. And then as you all know we keep a nice level loaded amount of R&D in our business. We think that that's appropriate and so I think we'll see some decline. But we continue to have an active R&D -- series of active R&D activities in that -- in Gulfstream. Jason Aiken : And then Carter on the first half of your question, I think, your inference was correct on the scale of the business that we divested to Maximus. There were however in the last 12 months or so a couple of other smaller divestitures we did in the IT portfolio. We had a small commercial health care divestiture. We had a next-generation 911 supportive business. When you add all those up the total annualized revenues were somewhere slightly in excess of $1 billion so that was to Phebe's point, a roughly $250 million a quarter impact. Carter Copeland : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks for the clarification. Howard Rubel : And Rocco this will be our last question coming up now please. Operator : Absolutely. Our final question today comes from Jonathan Raviv of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jonathan Raviv : Hey, thank you for the timing. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Jonathan Raviv : Phebe in terms of supporting that GDIT ramp into 2020, can you give us some color on how the personal recruiting site is going? I know it's a very important part of the people business. Phebe Novakovic : So those management teams have gelled. We took leaders from both legacy businesses and they have really gelled into one team one fight throughout the first three quarters and during this acquisition and integration we have kept almost every single key leader that we wanted to keep, I believe every leader we wanted to keep. And we are reducing our staff turnovers. So all of that to me is very wholesome sign that we are building a cohesive team that is -- at GDIT up and down their leadership chain that can maintain a very long-term robust and successful business. I'm very pleased with what I've seen there both in terms of the energy level, the cohesion and the culture that they have established, it's really quite impressive. Jonathan Raviv : Great, thanks. And then just thinking about that pickup. I mean, some peers in the market tend to talk about mid single digit organic growth. I know market share is not as important to you guys, but is that how we should think about the potential and should EBITDA growth accelerate in line with sales growth in 2020? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think we're growing about 3% this year and we'll see some nice growth in 2020. But beyond that we're not going to piecemeal 2020 at this point. We'll give you our 2020 estimate and outlook and detailed view of the business as we always do in the fourth quarter call after our fall review where we do in-depth analyses and bottom up operations reviews of each one of our businesses and we'll let you know then. Fair enough? Jonathan Raviv : That\u2019s right. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : You did. Thank you. Howard Rubel : And thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation, which will now contain our earnings outlook to the balance of the year. If you have any additional questions I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Rocco, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Howard. And good morning. As you can discern from our press release, we delivered attractive third quarter results with revenue of $9.76 billion operating earnings of $1.216 billion and net earnings from continuing operations of $913 million. We reported EPS of $3.14 per diluted share, $0.25 a share, better than the year ago quarter and $0.37 per share, better than the second quarter of this year. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue was up $667 million or 7.3%. By the way, we have enjoyed top-line growth every quarter for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Earnings from continuing operations of $913 million were up $49 million or 5.7% on a 7.1% improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and lower pension income. Operating margins return to the 12.5% level. Sequentially, revenue was up $206 million or 2.2% and operating earnings were up $126 million or 11.6% on higher operating margins. In short, we had significant sequential margin improvement. With respect to consensus, our margin rate was 40 basis points higher than forecasted by the South-side. This was offset in part by below the line items, leaving our EPS $0.07 better than consensus, the difference was provided by stronger operating earnings. With respect to cash, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $1,091 million and free cash flow of $847 million. As you can see from the charts attached to the press release, we enjoyed a good quarter with a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Total backlog of $67.4 billion, decreased $258 million or about a third of 1%. I have more to say about order intake if I discuss the separate operating segments and Jason will give you some color about cash and backlog in his remarks. Let me turn very briefly, the year-to-date 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. Revenue was up $2.8 billion or 10.7% against the first three quarters of 2018, driven by strong organic growth, plus the acquisition of CSRA at the beginning of the second quarter last year. To say it another way for clarity, CSRA attributed revenue was in every 2018 quarter, but the first. Operating earnings were up $89 million or 2.8% EPS was $0.31 better. In short, we delivered good sequential improvement and a good first 9 months. As such, essentially, we are on track to our internal plan and external expectations. So let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and the year-to-date. First Aerospace. Aerospace had a very good quarter in most important respects. Revenue of $2.5 billion was 23% higher than the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $393 million were $17 million or 4.5% higher on lower margins related to mix as fully expected. Let me give you a little color here with the quarter-over-quarter comparisons concerning -- concerning earnings and operating margin. You may recall that the Aerospace segment had a strong third quarter last year with 18.5% operating margin against 15.8% this quarter. This Delta is driven only in part by mix. The third quarter of 2018 contained a positive non-recurring settlement with the supplier. On a sequential basis, the story is even better revenue was up $359 million or 16.8% and earnings were up $62 million or 18.7% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin; excluding pre-owned sales from both periods, results in a 70 basis point sequential improvement in Aerospace margin. The past quarter saw the first G600 deliveries and in the quarter. Over 30% of our large-cabin deliveries were comprised of new product which is notably higher than the second quarter 2019. So despite the challenges of mix, we are making good progress. We are focused on aligning our costs with our operating cadence. Jason Aiken : Thank you Phebe and good morning. Our net interest expense in the third quarter was $114 million in both 2019 and 2018. That brings net interest expense to $350 million for the first 9 months of the year compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in 2019 is due primarily to the debt we issued at the end of the first quarter of 2018 to finance the acquisition of CSRA. We've also been carrying a higher than anticipated commercial paper balance through the first 9 months as we continue to work to resolve an outstanding receivable balance on one of our large international vehicle programs, that's been outstanding since the fourth quarter of last year. As Phebe mentioned, our cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $847 million a 93% conversion rate. The cash performance in the quarter reflected some progress on the international receivables I just mentioned. That said, we still have work to do to resolve the balance of the arrears. We're continuing to work this issue with the customer and expect to have the matter resolved by the end of the year. Assuming these outstanding payments come in this year we still expect full year free cash flow conversion to be well in excess of 100% of net income. Notwithstanding the progress made in the quarter, cash flow continued to be impacted by OWC growth at Gulfstream for reasons you now know and at Electric Boat. EB has been operating under an Un-definitive Contract Action or UCA, on the fifth Virginia-class Block, as we continue to work with the Navy to get that effort under contract. Until we get that contract executed our progress billings are temporarily limited. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : . Today's first question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Good morning. Phebe, wanted to one, touch on the G700 and how that potentially impacts the prior guidance that you've given, with regard to Gulfstream where I believe you've talked about EBIT growing a little bit in '20, but then growing significantly in '21, and margins approaching the high double-digit range again. How is the G700 all factored into that? Phebe Novakovic : So in -- no, because we expect the entry into service, several years out. But, but I think it might be opportune just to remind you guys how we're really thinking about the portfolio of our airplanes in our operating strategy. So, as you know, we've had a plan for the past several years to bring down the 650 production and increased 500 and 600 and we're doing that completely independently of the 700. We've been pretty voluble about the fact that G650 production and deliveries will be reduced next year and again the following year, so that will get production and delivery consistent with current demand. And on that score, we've had a very consistent order book for the 650 over the past three to four years. And as you know, we've had the benefit of a large backlog we've been able to work down over time. So listen, to be clear, this has nothing to do with the 700 launch announcement is a planned long ago. Our job is to balance the loss revenue and earnings from the planned reduction of G650 deliveries with an increased flow from 500 to 600 to keep earnings stable. If by the way, the state with that risk but it comes with ample opportunity, and as I said, this has been the consistent plan, and it remains our plan. And then as the G700 enters into service that will then become another factor in our long-range, in our earnings and revenue growth. David Strauss : Okay. I guess just asking a different, different way the -- that prior guidance that you've given for Gulfstream for '20 and '21, does that still hold? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I don't think we've given guidance per se, but we've indicated that we'll continue to grow our top line and our bottom line, as we've made that this making this transition. I think the bottom line will be a little , a little bit slower growth simply because we are managing that transition from the 650 to the 500 and 600 but look, our idea is to stabilize earnings with this, with this transition and we've done that and we'll continue to do that. So I think when you think about the business going forward, this is the strategy that has driven our behavior today and driving it and we'll drive that on a going forward basis so that will form how you're thinking about our performance going forward. David Strauss : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks good morning Phebe. Just a follow-up, just a question on the G700 you've always talked about the kind of dedicated production for the G500, G600 you started dedicated production facility with the G650. How should we think about that with the G700 is that going to be feathered in? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Well, it won't necessarily be feathered in. But to your question about, do we have a dedicated production facility in line? We do! See to expect that type of learning that we've seen on our other platforms. On the 700 as we come down our learning curve increased production and come down our learning curve that's all post-driven by the result of both our operating efficiency as well as our dedicated line. Peter Arment : And just as a follow-up related to that on the order front, I know you mentioned you expect healthy orders in the fourth quarter here, and you've had a book-to-bill over 1 for the 9 months year-to-date. How are you approaching the book to -- the bookings for the G700 is it following a similar path to the G500 and 600? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, as I think you know, we've announced we've got a nice robust backlog for the 700, and as I said, our fourth quarter, we expect to have even better and improved order activity increased order activity across our portfolio. By the way, we had more orders this year as again this quarter as against the quarter, third quarter of 2018. But in our that's compared against a 23% increase in revenue. This is a good quarter for us. Operator : And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much and Phebe congratulations on the G700 it looks terrific. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks Cai. Cai von Rumohr : Okay. You've indicated, I guess, first delivery in 2022, given that you're fairly close to first flight. Any -- will your comment, is the hope to be in the earlier part of the year or the latter part of the year? Phebe Novakovic : So look, we've, I think we're comfortable in the -- in the estimate of certification that we've given you. And we've looked through the prism as we thought about going forward, we look through the prism of the current regulatory environment, but you well know, even better than we do. And so we have factored that into our thinking. If that happens earlier that's great. Cai von Rumohr : Got it. And then I guess some industry sources suggest that you had been showing this plan for some time under NDAs. Were there any firm orders included in your bookings in the third quarter for the G700. Phebe Novakovic : We had some bookings on this airplane, that's all I'm going to say on that score. This airplane is going to be very popular with that particular market segment. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hi, thanks very much. Bigger picture question, bigger picture question for you guys actually. Section on capital allocation decisions across the businesses certainly appreciate, Jason, that the focus through first half of '20 is on the payment of debt. Just sort of thinking about, how should we think about things going forward and how you make those allocation decisions across the businesses? Jason Aiken : You know, John, I don't think we would really articulate any fundamental change to our long-standing approach to capital deployment as it as those priority stand internal investment first, where we have profitable opportunities for returns, followed by the steady and predictable dividend and then it really is about M&A were attractive accretive and in our core opportunities exist and share repurchase, but it and between that as you articulated for the moment the prioritization really is all about getting that debt pay down at least through the first half of next year. Once we get to that point, we'll roughly pay down half of the, the incremental debt from the CSRA acquisition will have the commercial paper balance behind us and will have a chance to look forward. But I don't think in terms of prioritizing those various avenues for capital deployment anything on that score has changed for us. Jon Raviv : Thank you. And then just a follow-up on GDIT perhaps Phebe you had mentioned that some of the dynamics are stretching out then is obviously a pretty heavy protest environment out there. Is there any thoughts about the acceleration previously pointed to heading into heading into next year in the context that peers generally doing mid-single digits, should we expect GDIT to take market share in that environment? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So GDIT has been taking market share. I mean if you think about their performance, the performance to set underlying for underlies their outcomes since the acquisition. We've got a 75% --70%, 75% win rate for the trailing 12 months. I mean, that is consistent month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, and as you all know, the book-to-bills and 1.2, 1.1 to do you have different year-to-date. So look, we are, we are winning and more than our fair share, but we have seen a protraction. I mean that's a significant amount of money for our contracts be tied up in -- in protest at around $1 billion. Now protests as you all know historically resolved to the benefit of the winner, so we are quite comfortable that that historical precedents will remain. But we've also seen a slowing and the execution of the contract awards and we suspect that will resolve through the course of next year and our rate of growth will be in part and no small measure driven by the increased rate in award volume. So nothing is systemic here. It's really a question of timing. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS, please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks Howard. I'm just wondering Jason, maybe you can give is a little bit more color on the cash flow and in particular, the Canadian advance, was in the numbers this quarter, and also just give is a boundary condition, if you don't make further progress on the Saudi lab. How does that play into the 3.5 billion implied free cash flow for the first quarter? Jason Aiken : Yes, sure. So, yes, in fact the advanced we received in the quarter is in the numbers that you've seen. So that's in the 90% conversion rate for the quarter. As it relates to the balance of the year, I think the way to think about it is we came into the year with just over $1 billion of arrears from the fourth quarter of last year. That's grown somewhat call it another half a billion dollars through the balance of this year and so that's what we're after right now that's what's currently outstanding. I think you can see in our disclosures, there is an un-billed total, un-billed investment somewhere in excess of $2 billion, $2.5 billion. But that's not necessarily what's factored in here. It's really between $1.5 billion that we're still working to resolve before the end of the year. Myles Walton : Okay and Phebe that marine margin I think is the best in a number of years. Just curious, is there anything one time and I know you didn't update the full-year projection, but let me just give us a little color to start of the year. I think you said that's the segment that had the most upside opportunity. And does this is this that coming through? Phebe Novakovic : So what you saw here was the strong and successful finish of Block 3. I mean Block 3 is largely done and that performance and the strong closing of that contract, really drove our margins, but as you all know margins in this business in particular Electric Boat have followed the same path for 18 years. We start a new block and because of the contract structure with our customer they receive some of the benefits of our prior improvements on the previous block and then we reset the bar and come back down our learning curves and that's where we really are on Block IV. But Block III is largely behind us and they -- and they've closed out very well. Myles Walton : Okay, thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning everyone. I know I just coming back to the Gulfstream margins. I want to try to ask a question about the progression there because I know there's a lot of investor focus on it. First, please just further the last quarter of the year. If I take the guidance that you had previously provided. Literally, it would imply, it's down sequentially in the fourth quarter. So you're expecting that. And then I had interpreted prior comments to suggest expansion but modest expansion in 2020 because you're feathering 650 lower and you're still early in the 500, 600 ramp. But then, a larger degree of expansion in '21 as you further along in both of those processes. Do I have that correct? Phebe Novakovic : So look, as you would imagine for a. for a business that has demonstrated the curve operating leverage year in year out on older models, the newer models Gulfstream will continue to march on margin improvement on a going forward basis. Don't forget that pre-own carries no margin. So to the extent that you've got a -- an implied lower margin in the fourth quarter, that's almost entirely reflected by by the pre-owned. As you well know just has no margin and is included in revenue, so there you have it. Noah Poponak : And am I directionally correct on the beyond 2019 comments? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think we've been pretty consistent all along that this business is going to get better and better over time. That's about what we're going to say at this juncture. Noah Poponak : And the will the G700 be the highest margin airplane in the portfolio, once it's at full-rate production? Phebe Novakovic : We are so not going there. So look, you can imagine that we do well on our airplanes because we don't compete on price and we have a, unerring commitment to cost reduction and cost optimization, every quarter, every month, every quarter we get better. Operator : And our next question today comes from George Shapiro Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, George. George Shapiro : Hi, your comment about the Q4 margin being lower from higher preowned. I mean, this quarter, it looks like there was for pre-owned for about $90 million. So you have would have earned 16.3% margin on the zero for the pre-own. Are you suggesting the fourth quarter is going to have higher pre-owned and I would have thought we're kind of through the G500 block. So that the fourth quarter margin would still be above the third quarter? Jason Aiken : So, George taking your premises in reverse order, you're right about the progression on the underlying manufacturing improvements and I think that's what Phebe was alluding to earlier, we'll continue to see that progress quarter-on-quarter for Gulfstream. But yes, it's your first premise, based on the inputs we're seeing right now and the contracts that will deliver in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see at this point more pre-owned aircraft sales in the fourth quarter. George Shapiro : And Jason that will more than offset the fact that the 500 through its initial block. So the margin should step up some in the fourth quarter? Jason Aiken : I mean, I don't know that I want to piecemeal it down to that level. Those are two of the many inputs that go into the margins at Gulfstream in any quarter, when we've talked about this many times in the past. There is varying R&D levels, there's different mix of aircraft deliveries in all the different inputs the Jet Aviation service margins and so on. So I think we've articulated a couple of those discrete ones that are clear at this point, but the implied fourth quarter there is a couple of people who are picking up on is, as usual, a blend of a whole myriad of factors. So I think the most important point here for the long-term investor is the steady regular improvement in the operating cadence and margin of the production of the airplanes at Gulfstream. George Shapiro : And just a clarification for you, Jason. The advance you got this quarter for -- from Canada. Was that just for the new Canadian contract or was there also some from the Saudi receivable? Jason Aiken : That is strictly related to our relationship with the Canadians. On the new program. George Shapiro : On the new program. Okay. So when you commented in the third quarter you expected to get some cash in August and in the balance by the end of the year, you were really just referring to this new contract, which obviously hadn't been announced at that point? Phebe Novakovic : Well that's set we had anticipated that we would get this contract award and there would be an attendant along with that. That is one separate and distinct issue. As you all know, our international, the payments on our international program out of Canada have remained slow. Let me just remind everybody, there is no dispute on quantum, there no dispute on the fact that it is owed. It's simply a question of timing and we are still hopeful that we resolve that by the end of the year, but two distinct elements. Okay? Operator : Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey, good morning everybody. Thank you. You've sort of touched this little bit Phebe but can you elaborate on the comment you made, when you said the G700 has stimulated G650 discussions what you mean by that. And then the second part and I'm done here is, any thoughts on the tariff situation in Europe. Have you heard any concerns from your customer looks like this are going to be exempt, but any any rumblings about that over there? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So an inverse order, none on the tariffs and in fact ex-US business continues to be very fulsome. But let's talk a bit about the 700 and frankly the introduction of the 700 clarifies the 650 and let me give you a little bit of an explanation on why and talk to you about what the 700 is and what it is not. The G700 is in a slightly different market space, but in the same market segment as the 650. It is not a competitor. It is an alternative. It is not a replacement for the 650. Customers very clearly understand that and their buying decisions are motivated by a host of factors idiosyncratic and individual factors including the missions they fly, the ramp size, the makeup of the rest of their fleet. So I think it has clearly an ARM in our experience the 700 is clarified the 650 and been helpful. Operator : Our next question today comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : And Rocco this is Mr. Rubel -- This will be our last question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Robert Spingarn : So Phebe, I wanted to go to GDIT and just talk about the margin progression. You talked about some of the expenses in the quarter a pressure on the margins in the quarter, but otherwise would be higher. If we go back to your prior guide, I think that indicates a pretty robust fourth quarter, so could we talk about that and what normalized margins look like? And then just for a follow-up. Jason, I hear you on the cash deployment and retiring the debt, but given interest rates might it not make sense to look at the share buyback here just doing the math? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : But we're comfortable with our leverage and we're going to pay down that debt and we historically have never taken out debt to buy stock. So all sorts of reasons but we have discussed over the years. But look, GDIT margins were consistent with what we anticipated minus this one-time charge as we exited a line of business that we have inherited with CSRA. I don't think I need to remind you because I know you understand this that -- their EBITDA margins are industry-leading so their margin performance will continue to improve. Howard Rubel : This is Mr. Rubel. Thank you very much for the call today and thank you everybody else for joining us. As a reminder, you should refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and the highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Operator : And thank you sir. Today's conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter 2019, Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Alyssa, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. Phebe Novakovic :  Good morning and thank you, Howard. So, earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.77 billion, earnings from continuing operations of $1.02 billion and earnings of $3.51 per fully-diluted share. This 14% improvement in EPS against the fourth quarter of 2018 was a result in part of a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter-over-quarter earnings improvement at Aerospace was a major driver of this result. We enjoyed a very solid fourth quarter and a strong 2019. We achieved most of our operational and financial goals and added meaningfully to our backlog, in some cases rather dramatically. The results in comparisons with prior periods are straightforward and rather compelling. I'll go through them briefly, I'll leave more time for my thoughts on the business segments, our outlook for 2020 and your questions.  I also think you'll find the press release and the highlights chart on our website fulsome and helpful. As we had indicated at the start of the year, the final quarter was our strongest. Earnings per share at $3.51 beat consensus by $0.06, revenue and operating earnings were somewhat better, our provision for tax was lower offset somewhat by a higher share count and higher borrowing cost. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter with good performance compared to the year ago quarter as well as the third quarter of 2019. For the full-year, we had fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.98. Revenue of $39.35 billion was up over 2018 by $3.2 billion an increase at each of our reporting segments. Operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up $191 million or 4.3% over 2018. Earnings from continuing operations of $3.5 billion were up to $126 million or 3.8% over 2018. Importantly, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.76 above 2018. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in our backlog to a new high of $87 billion. A very strong order intake particularly in aerospace and marine, positions the company well for 2020 and beyond. Let me review the full-year and the quarters on a year-over-year basis without reference to sequential comparisons. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that we have significantly more revenue, higher operating earnings, higher earnings from continuing operations and higher earnings per share than in the third quarter of 2019. So, I'll discuss each group, provide some color where appropriate. Jason Aiken : Thank you Phebe and good morning. I'm going to cover a number of topics to provide some color with respect to our 2019 results and some context for the 2020 guidance that Phebe will give you in just a few minutes. First is cash. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, reflecting approximately 200% of net income. That resulted in the cash conversion rate of 57% for the full-year, obviously lower than we were striving for. As you might infer from this result, we did not collect the outstanding arrears on our large international combat vehicle program before the end of the year. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2020, initially by business group and then a companywide roll-up. In Aerospace, we expect 2020 revenue to be about $10 billion, without pre-owned sales up from 2019. Operating margin will be about 15.7% to 15.8%. Revenue will be much stronger in the second-half as well margin rate. Operating margin will accelerate through the year similar to 2019, starting in the 14% range and ending around 18% by the fourth quarter. We are seeing 5% revenue growth in 2020 in between $40 million to $45 million of improved earnings. In Combat, we expect revenues about $7.3 billion and approximately $300 million increase over 2019. We expect operating margins to be about 14.3%. Here again, look for both revenue earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year, with a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to seek a solid growth for the business with orders for the Abrams and solid demand for our Stryker vehicles ammunitions. Like last year, we see domestic volumes rising faster than our international business. Although a few international opportunities could tip that bound. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $9.85 billion, an increase of almost $700 million over 2019. Operating margin in 2020 is anticipated to be about 8.6%. We anticipate growth at each of our yards a long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work which is expanding exponentially. Our biggest opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted margin rate. We expect IT revenue of approximately $8.45 billion consistent with 2019. With margins in the 7.6% range, the results in a modest increase in operating earnings. We expect Mission Systems revenue in 2020 of about $5.1 billion, an increase of approximately $140 million. We anticipate operating margins about 14.1%, again building throughout the year. So, for 2020 companywide, we expect to see slightly more than $40.7 billion of revenue, up 4% over 2019, and operating margin of 11.9%. This all rolls to forecasted $12.55 to $12.60 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it did in 2019, with Q1 about $2.60, and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operation. It assumes a 17.5% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count constant with yearend figures, so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this final thought, the near imminent resolution of our large international contract and attendant cash issues, including the current receipt of funds provides enormous clarity in the liability of funds. This coupled with our strong balance sheet, leaves us with greater flexibility for capital deployment than we've had in the recent past. We intend to utilize it to create value for our shareholders. Jason Aiken : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up. So, Alyssa, would you please remind the participants how to enter the queue now, please? Operator : Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.  And the first question today comes from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi Ron. Ronald Epstein : Just following-up on your final comment there that you have more flexibility around capital deployment. That was a bit of a teaser. What are you thinking? I mean, what, buying back shares? I mean, what are you thinking about that? Phebe Novakovic : So, we'll deal with our short term debt and then we will buy back shares appropriately. Ronald Epstein : But, anything else? I mean, are you thinking about other things to do in the portfolio? Meaning, I mean, we've seen a flurry of M&A in the space. So I mean, is there anything -- Phebe Novakovic : We don't comment on M&A. Nice try, Ron. Ronald Epstein : Okay. Alright. Alright, thank you, guys. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, David. David Strauss : Phebe, on the Gulfstream, I guess, revenue forecast. Can you help us a bit maybe at a high-level in terms of some of the moving pieces there? What you're expecting for total aircraft deliveries kind of the ramp down on the 650? Phebe Novakovic : So, we expect about 150 aircraft deliveries this year, and consistent with our expressed plan to you all sometime ago. We will ramp down the 650 deliveries as we increase the 500 and 600 deliveries. So, that mix and cadence around that mix is anticipating, is playing out as anticipated. David Strauss : And do you expect more of the 650 ramp down to occur in '20 or '21? I think before you've been talking about more of that hit coming in '20 versus '21? Phebe Novakovic : Largely in '20, but we will continue to ramp according to really the demand. We are ramping to a point where we have demand and delivery in an equilibrium, and I'm quite comfortable that we'll get there. But, it's pretty clear that it was very clear to me that in 2020, 650 deliveries will as anticipated decrease. Operator : The next question today comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thank you so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : On GDIT Phebe, it looks to me now the organic revenue growth has been a little bit below what some of the other peers in the industry been able to achieve, and that's why they continue in 2020. Now, is this a consequence of these award delays, or is it something to do with just the time it takes to integrate CSRA or something else? And when would you expect this revenue growth rate to pick up? Phebe Novakovic : So, I was pretty explicit in my remarks around that, but just to reiterate. There were three fundamental factors. First, we experienced significant delays in the execution of awards. The velocity of execution slowed considerably, and the number of potential awards caught and this set of purgatory increased dramatically. Second, and don't forget this, we exited two lines of business last year. And third, we had several mature programs and we lost one or two recompetes, both of which reduced near-term volume that will be replaced over time by our new limbs. So think of this latter category as mix and timing. Robert Stallard : So is it safe to say\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : So, to your second question, we had anticipated 2019 from 2020 would show some growth, that growth has now moved to the right in 2021. And we're expecting mid-single digit growth, again driven by the execution and velocity of the contract awards. Robert Stallard : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Thank you. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Doug. Doug Harned : Can you take us through a little bit on the Block V Virginia-class, because this is obviously a bigger boat, it's very important? What are the differences that you see between Block V and Block IV? And how should we expect that to flow through to financial performance over next several years? Phebe Novakovic : So, you quite accurately point out the Block V represents a considerable increase in capability for the U.S. Navy, and a considerable increase in our workload, given that the addition of the new capabilities is executed entirely by us. And so, as we think about from Block IV to Block V, we continue to come down our learning curves. And we are sequencing all of these now builds around the first delivery of Columbia, which we\u2019ll start work at the end of this year. So, I think that with respect to Block V, our job is simply to execute Block V effectively. And as I said in my remarks, the key here is just increasing our margin and really improving our ship over ship capabilities. So, we've got Block V in very good shape along with our Navy customer, and we've begun to work on it, and we will continue that execution for the next several years. Doug Harned : And then you talked about the investment you're having to make for CapEx for both in Block V and Columbia class. But, when you think about the trajectory for that investment it's not just facilities but it's also labor. And when you look at planning for this, how do you see the trajectory for your costs and for reimbursement by the customers, you work to build up here? Phebe Novakovic : So, let's take that in two fold. First, our customers well aware of the imperatives that we face. And they have worked closely with us to better match the investment with the return, which is wholesome for everyone. With respect to the essence, and now that your question ramping up on growth in our workforce, so we started this about eight years ago, working in public-private partnerships with Rhode Island and Connecticut to begin to trend the kinds of workers that we needed, and in large numbers. That coupled with our internal training program, we have demonstrated over the last four years. We have brought new shipbuilders into the yard at a higher initial capabilities. And then they continue to learn. So, the Navy has fully supported our efforts with respect to expanding our workforce and the need to bring training up into skills that frankly in this country have atrophied. When you think about plumbing and pipe fitting and electricians and welders, welders are critical and key capability. A number of those in the U.S. training programs throughout the United States had to had atrophied a bit. And in our world up in New England, we are rebuilding those at a very rapid rate. So, we're very comfortable that we can meet our expectations for growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much. So at one point, Phoebe, you were talking about the G500 and 600 coming down the learning curve, and becoming more profitable as we move out in time. And I think you suggested in 2021, directionally margin should be up as that plus ways the mix shift away from the 650. Is that still a trend that you look for? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, it's a trend that we look for and that we are experiencing. As you would expect from the operating discipline, and the price discipline and cost discipline that we have, we continue to see learning and nice learning on each and every one of these aircrafts coming down the line to offset the reduction in part, as offset the reduction in 650 deliveries. We have clearly articulated this plan several years ago and we've been right on sequence on it. So, I think there's nothing new there in terms of the strategy and the execution around that strategy. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. And then Jason, quickly for you. You talked of conversion going to 100% in 2021. Can you give us some color in terms of how much does pension contribution come down if at all? How much does CapEx come down? And what kind of a benefit do you get from inventory liquidation on the 500 and 600? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Sure. So, when you think about the capital investment, I think, I said earlier, we had expected about 3% of sales in 2019, and ended up at about 2.5%. You should expect to see that in a similar range, call it 2.5% in 2020 because of the elements of that that we pushed to the right. That'll step down starting in 2021, so that by call it 2023, we will be back to the typical, more historic typical 2% range that we've been in. Pension contributions, on the other hand, as I mentioned, elevated $400 million plus in 2020. It will stay elevated for another year or so maybe a year and then come back down from there. So, a little bit of a surge in pension contribution and then returning back down to a lower level. And then, I think in terms of the working capital, the biggest single thing that you should expect is we ended the year with somewhere close to the neighborhood of $2.9 billion of unbilled receivables contracting process if you will, on the large international combat vehicle program. That will step down to the point that that working capital is essentially liquidated by the end of call it 2023. That along with the 500 and 600 as you mentioned those test articles will be sold here in 2020 and 2021, respectively. So, those will be a benefit. And as a result, the aggregate outcome of that as we expect to actually see free cash flow in '21 and beyond, call it 2021, '22 even '23, actually in excess of 100% of net income. So, we will start this recapture some of that shortfall that we've had over the past couple of years. Operator : The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph DeNardi : Hey, good morning. Phebe, if we go back four or five years, I think there was a debate as to how the Navy would afford Colombian and Virginia and they have decided to fill both simultaneously. When does that actually get locked in? Do you see any political risk to that that decision gets revisited whether to feather in a Colombian placement Virginia, or is that a risk going on at this point? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So, think about long-term demand for a given product line as driven by the war fighter's needs. And with respect to classes of our submarines there is real war fighter demand on Virginia. And then on Columbia, that is a national program and it can't wait. So the nation sees the decision-makers in both the executive branch and on capital you will see the imperative to fund and wholesomely fund both of those programs. And as we sit here today, we see pretty good surety, very good surety on a going forward basis. The stability of that backlog and the reliability of increasing backlog in submarine for quite some time to come. Think about the submarine business, ship building in general, bur the submarine business in particular, as executing slowly over time relatively slowly over time given the complexity of building a nuclear submarine. That is offset in terms of predictability of backlog. These are very secure platforms, because they are in demand. They are in current demand and they will be in future demand, there are certain imperatives. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning everyone. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak : Phebe, I wondered if you could just expand on what you're seeing in the overall business chat in Gulfstream demand environment, because on the one hand some of the leading indicator data there has looked a little tougher, but obviously you've got your new product set and have the really strong bookings in the quarter. So just kind of curious to here we're seeing. And was the book-to-bill excluding the G700 also above one in the quarter? Phebe Novakovic : So, the answer to your question, the latter question is yes. If you have been following us and you have for some time, you'll know that that our basic predicate for this business is that new product and truly new product, clean sheet airplanes all new drive demand. And that predicate is where now, not surprisingly, in my mind. So, our new products are generating demand and are expected new product in the 700 is generating demand. So, think about the experience of OEMs in this market as really idiosyncratic to the product offerings staff. So, our experience in this market is that we have enjoyed nice, steady demand year-over-year, that demanded is increased as the new products are announced and enter into service. And in addition, so much of selling airplanes is predictability of the delivery and reliability of the airplane and the ability to service. All of that drives demand and we are, I think, arguably, without questions, the best-in-class with respect to all of those key factors. So, we are quite comfortable with our positioning and the fourth quarter was good and the pipeline is active. Noah Poponak : And then just on the margins in the segments. I think the company has said that the 2021 rate of expansion should be faster than the '20 rate of expansion, and I think you've even said getting back into the high-teens '21 maybe '22. Do I have that, right? Does that still hold in terms of the trajectory from here? Phebe Novakovic : The trajectory does hold and will end this year in the high-teens margin. But then, so this is a complex business of lots of moving parts. So, margins tend to be somewhat variable quarter-over-quarter largely driven by mix. But again, the basic thesis around the introduction of these airplanes and the profitability and the realization of that profitability remains today, the same as it was. Operator : The next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes, good morning. Maybe, it doesn't look like the 650 deliveries really came down much if anything in '19. So, are the declines in '20 reflecting just lower backlog in 650 today, than a year ago or what's really driving the 650 decline? Phebe Novakovic : 650 backlog has not declined. We've seen a nice increase. Look, the deliveries quarter-over-quarter of these airplanes is often driven by customers. So we had, about three 600s that for various outside the United States regulatory issues, or delayed, we'll move into this delivery is expected for this quarter. And we have some 650s that customers wanted earlier, so we took a few of those. And we're able to execute and satisfy those customers' needs. So, 650 has done extremely well, not in significantly, as we talked about in this call and the third quarter. There are a lot of demand signals and demand catalysts for the 650. The introduction to 700 clarified it. And frankly, as we told you, what has increased 650 demand. So, by the way, this airplane, we've got 400 of them in service, and some of them are coming out of warranty and there's a natural replacement cycle. So, we continue to see nice demand for the 650. George Shapiro : So why bring down the deliveries if the backlog is up, I must be missing something here? Phebe Novakovic : Because, ultimately overtime you want to fully match the backlog with the deliveries. And if you recall, we entered this transition period with an extraordinarily long and I argued that time, a too long wait time. And we have equalized that wait time to order to wait time significantly during this transition period. And we'll get back to that regular cadence. But look, our 650 order book, and what we've got in backlog fully supports our going forward 650 production estimates. That's what you really want to see, if the order book is enough to satisfy your 650 deliveries. Howard Rubel : Operator, this upcoming question will be our last. Operator : The last question today comes from Seth Seifman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Seth Seifman : Phebe, you mentioned in Marine Systems that there was opportunity in operating margin. Are there specific milestones that you would point to potentially coming up this year? And if so, what and when are they? Phebe Novakovic : So, there are multiple milestones in any given year, and they are tied to exceedingly large number of internal milestones and milestones to our Navy customer. But that's not the only thing that drives. So, we will see some of those, as we always do in any given year. But really our ability to drive margins is all about the cost control and performance, and we continue to drive hard on both. This is a very high performance shipyard Seth Seifman : Thank you very much. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much. And thank you all for joining our call today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me take a moment to discuss General Dynamics' response to COVID-19 and its impact on us. We've been designated a national critical infrastructure company and as such are required to continue full operations, which we have done. I am proud of our patriotic employees who have continued to work hard to fulfill their mission in support of our armed forces as we face this crises together. Our men and women in uniform continue to serve and we must as well. Ensuring a safe work environment for our workforce has been and remains our top priority. We have 39,000 employees tele-working from home unfortunately our large manufacturing sites cannot do that. At these sites, we follow CDC recommended guidelines and practice social distancing where possible. We have increased shift work and the use of PPE. We are conducting temperature screening where feasible. As additional screening and ultimately testing become available, we will aggressively implement those as well. Our leadership teams have been and will continue to be in the workplace leading our people. This is early in the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our business. So far we've experienced some deterioration in efficiency driven by absenteeism at a couple of our facilities. We expect absenteeism to decline as we see the rate of infection slow. We're also incurring rather significant cost to sanitize the work environment in our facilities and to provide additional PPE. We've also seen definite weaknesses in the supply chain particularly with respect to some of Gulfstream suppliers. Gulfstream is working closely with the suppliers who have also been hurt by the disruptions of the commercial airplane OEMs. Hopefully, we can sort our way through these issues, but some of them are difficult. The Department of Defense is accelerating payment to us to support the defense industrial base. We believe that this will prove to be very helpful. Regarding the company's first quarter performance, as you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.43 per diluted share on revenue of $8.75 billion and operating earnings of $941 million and net income of $706 million. Revenue was down $512 million or 5.5% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $73 million or 7.2% and net earnings were down only $39 million or 5.2%. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. The first thing I would like to note is a key accomplishment on the financing front in the quarter. In anticipation of the pending maturity of $2.5 billion of notes in May of this year and given the extreme volatility we've seen in the markets since the outbreak of the pandemic we issued $4 billion of fixed-rate notes in late March at very attractive rates. While this financing was part of our planning pre-COVID-19, the additional liquidity enhances our financial flexibility during the pandemic, particularly in light of the fact that our free cash flow is weighted toward the second half of the year. To that point, our free cash flow in the quarter was negative $851 million. The cash performance in the quarter was impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak most notably at Gulfstream due to delayed customer payments associated with the net 11 airplanes we weren\u2019t able to deliver. As Phebe noted, customer orders were also postponed in the last two weeks of the quarter. On the defense side, we've seen accelerated payments coming from some of our customers starting in the month of April in the form of increased progress payment rates and other contract mechanism, but we've passed those monies on to our suppliers to help sustain our supply base. In fact as of last week, we had received approximately $55 million in accelerated payments from our customers and advanced almost $300 million to our suppliers on an accelerated basis. After all this we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $5.3 billion and a net debt position of $12.7 billion down slightly from this time last year. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $107 million down from $117 million in the first quarter of 2019 on a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance. But for the year, we're revising our interest forecast up to approximately $490 million to reflect the additional borrowing I discussed earlier. Q2 will be the peak interest expense for the year. As Phebe noted, we had ample liquidity including $5 billion in lines of credit which we renewed during the first quarter and we expect the outstanding debt balance to come down over the next couple of quarters as we repay the $2.5 billion maturing in May as well as our commercial paper balance. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $185 million in the quarter were consistent with year ago. We expect CapEx for the year to be down somewhat from our original forecast as we manage that spend in light of the circumstances but still in the range of 2.5% of sales on a reduced sales number. In the quarter we paid $295 million in dividends and spent $500 million on the repurchase of 3.4 million of our shares. This covers the dilution from stock option exercises the we were unable to address last year due to cash constraints plus the anticipated dilution for the current year. For the year we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 85% of net income versus the 85% to 90% we previously forecasted, reflecting the reductions in Gulfstream aircraft production and delivery rates, partially offset by the reduced capital expenditures, cost savings across the company and somewhat lower cash taxes. Speaking of taxes, our effective tax rate was 16.7% for the quarter benefiting from several factors including lower international taxes and increased research and development tax credits. For the year we're lowering our anticipated tax rate from 17.5% to 17%. As Phebe mentioned in her remarks, we finished the quarter with total backlog of $85.7 billion, that's up 24% over this time last year and total potential contract value including options and ideology IDIQ contracts was $124 billion up 20% over the year ago quarter. And just one last thought for you as you consider the quarterly progression throughout the year. Obviously there's more uncertainty than we would normally have at this point in the year but as you might expect, we anticipate the second quarter being the low point in EPS in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 below the first quarter with a steady ramp in the second half to achieve the updated targets that Phebe discussed. Howard, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard Rubel : Thanks Jason. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Chad could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Thank you.  And our first question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hi. Good morning. Sorry I was on mute. So I realize this is probably very difficult given where we are in the unprecedented nature of the situation. I think the deliveries you talked about at Gulfstream this year coming out a backlog I think was probably fairly consistent with maybe where people thought and maybe even a bit better. As we look out beyond this year and we think about what might happen to the backlog as we move through the year and as you deliver out backlog, is there any way to kind of I don\u2019t know if there any way to bound that or maybe any way to talk about some of the distinct aspects of this pressure that Gulfstream is seeing now versus periods of pressure in the past? Phebe Novakovic : So let me address that in two parts. Our reduction in production this year was driven most exclusively by probations in the supply chain. Some of our suppliers entered this crisis somewhat impaired both from exposure to the commercial aviation market and some financial difficulties. The crisis exacerbated that and even before they saw hit, they were having some difficulty keeping up with our original production rate. So we took down production which we believe helps de-risk the current environment and frankly de-risks some of '21 if in fact we see weakening demand. But look with respect to this year's production you can only go as fast as your weakest link in your chain. So that's part one. Part two, which really I think teaming out a bit is how we demand in this environment. And as I think we eluded to we fully expect business aviation to recover in due course. The question is specific timing but this will again be a robust market for us and will lead with a strong portfolio of new products. If you think about it one of the outcomes that could occur as a result of this particular crisis is the business can ill afford to rely on those commercial airline providers who are either financially weak or unpredictable. So the fundamental case for business aviation remains the same if not somewhat strengthened by this crisis and frankly I think there is a case to be made that much will inert of business aviation as a result of this particular crisis. But there is an important reality I think for all of us to comprehend understand this market and that is in all markets up or down we have the distinct advantage in product, service and cost that leads the competition to compete only on price and availability. Operator : The next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on what you might seen in the shorter cycle business jet off the market and the FBOs this quarter and partly in April as well, whether this could be a lead indicator of where the demand environment is going. Phebe Novakovic : Sure, I think is a particularly unusual environment and that it was worldwide and the fact that all human beings, not just particular sectors. So hence the imposition of travel restrictions both in the United States and elsewhere, that really drove our flying hours. So we saw a considerable decrease in the number of flying hours that we believe will resume when some of these -- some of the travel restrictions begin to ease and people are still a little bit safer in traveling. I'll tell you the loading at most of our service centers remains solid. We've implemented some rolling furloughs at a couple of our smaller sites, scheduling inspections and planned maintenance continue at a good pace but some of the discretionary work I think referred for avionics upgrades have fallen back a bit, but again once we resume normal or begin to approach normal flying cadence that we anticipate that some of this will likewise resolve. Operator : And the next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : One for Jason and then one for you Phebe. The one for Jason and maybe you mentioned but if you did, I missed it. If you can reconcile, you have in the back your gross orders and then if you just look at backlog, I guess that's a net number. Is the roughly $300 difference primarily cancellations, which you gave the list in the back there or what is it? And then for you Phebe, in terms of the expectation for deliveries for the year, I assume the second quarter is going to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year and also where the status of the Eisai certification for the 600, thanks? Phebe Novakovic : Okay. Well, we had four defaults in the quarter. A chunk of those were not for 2020 airplanes. Their customers we expect to see back. With respect to the second quarter, I think deliveries will be stronger, but as you can imagine with the reduction in production we are taking cost out of our business and we'll have some charges around those particularly in any of the risk charges in the moment and so that could -- that depresses second quarter a bit. But deliveries could be we expect them to be higher once and depending on how fast and at what sequence and in what areas these travel restrictions lift. It's very hard if you think about it, it is we need those travel restrictions to kind of abate because people typically come to pick up their airplanes in Savanna or we fly -- we fly them elsewhere to effectually transfer and that's extremely difficult and kind of constrained environment. But as we see some of the rolling reopening both in the United States and outside the United States, we expect some of those deliveries to revolve nicely. Operator : And our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Just Phebe one on the implied Gulfstream decremental margins, I think you took down revenue by about $1.5 billion and you EBIT expectation by about $400 million applying some more mid to high 20 decremental margins. How much of this is driven by just reduced productivity because of production issues, work related issues and supplier issues? The decremental margins are a bit higher than I thought we would see? Phebe Novakovic : Some of that is based on efficiency particularly as we learn to optimize operating in a CDC driven environment, but some of it is also mix. David Strauss : Okay. And then a follow up on capital deployment, obviously you have the debt pay down here in May. You guys deal with commercial paper, but how are you thinking about share repurchase in the current environment given maybe political headwinds to doing that versus where your stock price currently sits, thanks? Phebe Novakovic : I think you're quite right to point out the political concerns, the concerns in the policy arena about stock buybacks but from my perspective in periods of great uncertainty and volatility, maintaining your liquidity and the strength of your balance sheet is key. So we're going to stay on stock repurchases at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Phebe, I know each one of these downturns are demand flips in aerospace has its own sort of unique fingerprint and I wondered if you might just kind of help give us some color on what this one is like in terms of your customer conversation I would imagine that the big majority of your customers the Fortune 500 companies out there going through some sort of exercise on the timing of expenditures on aircraft when the tapping revolvers and what not. I just -- how does that discussion, how is that going and then how does that evolve in terms of the timing of those, what I would assume are continued purchases in the future, thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So one of these elements that is distinctly different from the last time that we experienced in the 2008 timeframe, the great recession was that interest remains very active, whereas in the recession it simply stopped because of the impact on multiple key sectors. Here it's really been about more about simply timing. How soon does the economy reopen and how soon can we get travel restrictions back. So the conversations are continuing. That hasn\u2019t stopped, but in terms of translating that activity into orders, some of that is going to take some time as we see how all of the reduction in travel restrictions as well as the stabilization in the economy occur, but we see this more as a question of timing in this environment. As of the moment the backlog is holding up very nicely, which results are distinctly different from the last time, but we're always mindful that if you have worldwide economic crises of the large economies that become really dire, backlog is an issue that we're going to have to follow very carefully and we're being very mindful. This is a company that has been through this kind of environment before albeit for very different reasons and manifesting itself at different ways. Carter Copeland : And is it fair to characterize the decisions you will make from a production standpoint to get to the lower deliveries s temporary in nature whether it's furloughs or timing related, I guess are you protecting upside in your production capacity for when things return to normal? Is that the right way to think about what you're doing? Phebe Novakovic : I think the right way to think about it is that when you have changes in your environment, you have to react fairly quickly, postulating the best possible outflow -- postulating the best as you can what various outcomes are like and what we have done is in the moment sized our production so that our supply chain can keep up with it, but also recognizing that it prepares us if in fact demand does increasingly weaken in next year to manage that risk as we'll. So I think we have found our risk as well as we possibly can in the moment, understanding where what we see. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you very much. So number of dealers we've talked to expect as you indicate the demand should pick up later in the year as kind of COVID impact abates, but one of the concerns they have is that basically there's been a weakening in terms of the preowned market. The pricing there is starting to erode and may go down and in particular with the G650 where you have a large install base that preowned G650s would compete with your production. Are you seeing or to what extent are you concerned about potential pricing pressures from the preowned market, thanks? Phebe Novakovic : We have yet to see any. We done see any significant build up of like new preowned Gulfstream and we've seen no impact on price. That preowned inventory for each of our large cabin including the 650 is well below the market standard threshold. So at the moment, we either have a lot of preowned inventory in our house nor do we see that it is impacted our current demand, nor our current -- our current pricing. So this again is very different than what we saw in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. Preowned is simply not an issue in the moment. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks so much and one follow-up would be can you give us an update on how you are doing G500, G600 production and the expectation or certification of the G700 in late 2021? Phebe Novakovic : So let's go in reverse order the G700 continues to performance test -- it's test pattern. So we have about 100 hours under our belt and airplane is performing extremely well. The G500 and G600, of course are going to be some of the change in the production that we have set for the year, some the mix issue but the demand for both of those programs has been wholesome and is increasing. And I think George asked the question that I failed to answer on EASA, and you tease it that as well indirectly. EASA had been slowed by the impact of the MAX. And while I can't speak to them directly in terms of their timing, this has no doubt impacted them as well but we'll get through that and these airplanes, the more that they're in the market, the more people see exactly what these airplanes can do for them and they're pretty impressed. Operator : The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak : Phebe, is 100% of the Gulfstream delivery and revenue outlook reduction that you\u2019ve made here today, is 100% of that from supply chain disruption and inability to fly to deliver airplane disruption and none of it from demand impact? Phebe Novakovic : Really isn\u2019t demand driven. I think I noted two factors a couple of times, but let me just reiterate as I think I've discussed some fulsome detail but supply chain, but we also have some efficiency issues within these plants within our assembly manufacturing plant as we learn to optimize production under the social distancing rules, additional PPE cleaning as shift work as we've increased the number of shifts. So as we began to optimize that over time in production environment, that will also allow us to mitigate any impacts from some of the inherent inefficiency there, but that was also an issue, but overwhelmingly the predominant issue here was the supply chain. And frankly as I said if you think about it in terms of you simply seen significantly weakening demand. We have done a nice job to de-risk some of '21 and I think that's where you could potentially see demand and one of the salutary benefits of the actions that we're taking today, do provide some risk mitigation for '21. So that's why I've said a couple times, we believe that we've founded our risk in all respects at the moment. Noah Poponak : Have you seen any -- not just through Q1 but year to date, have you seen any cancellations or deferrals in the existing backlog? Phebe Novakovic : Yeah I mentioned earlier, we had four and all of whom we have while three of whom we expect to come back but that is all that we've seen today and the backlog of how they're continuing to hold up very nicely. But we recognize that this will de-risk any additional impacts to the backlog, but so far we're not hearing noises coming out of the customer base and the backlog of any note at the moment. Operator : Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Maybe changing gears a little bit to your navy business, the navy has accelerated its procurement of systems, I mean if you talk to the procurement leadership in the navy and they\u2019ll tell you how they're very proud of the amount of work they put under contract in a short period of time. How are you seeing that in your naval business and how do you expect that to flow through the rest of the year? Phebe Novakovic : So our navy procurement people have been really leaders and beacons of stability and foresight during this entire crisis. They have increased the velocity at which we've gotten contract awards, we particularly see that on the repair side. Our new ship construction is our large big contracts. I wouldn't expect to see any additional particular increase in velocity on those but we have on the shorter cycle businesses and they have been very, very supportive in understanding the need to undergird the defense industrial supply chain. Ron Epstein : And then as one follow-on, you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks and even in some of the questions that you\u2019ve got some concerns over the supply chain. How do you see that playing out particularly if you\u2019ve got a smaller let's call it a mom-and-pop supplier who is largely commercial aerospace that don\u2019t do much defense work and their supplying into Gulfstream? How are you trying to mitigate that risk? Phebe Novakovic : So if you can imagine these are all sensitive negotiations. We're working closely with all. We know all of our challenge suppliers are at the moment, working closely with them to get -- to provide on-site mitigation and support where we can and ultimately if we have to bring it in house we will. But we have managed through this and will continue to do so, but there is risk here. It's not without the risk for reasons that I think you all can understand as well as we can. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Turning to IT for a moment, any visibility or perspective on when we might see some of those nice backlog trends translate into growth when some of those items that you slide might dissipate. And then also can you talk about how IT is supporting the customer in the current environment and how it can be oriented to support new priorities coming out of the coronavirus crisis? Phebe Novakovic : So one of the elements of GDIT is an enormous agility coupled with their customer intimacy. So as our customers adjust both on the defense Intel and federal civilian environments. We'll work very closely with them on new opportunities. I think one of the challenges is that our customer needs to get back up and in a regular cadence and regular order and that will then drive our ability to attend these sites. While many of our people can work from home. A lot of them have to be on site with the customer and so once the customer gets up in full bore operations, that will drive then additional revenue on our part but look these GDIT has had been very successful in winning additional business that ultimately begins to translate into revenue and profitable revenue at that. So I think we need to particularly on IT get everybody back and working and then have a sense if we have any timing issues from some incremental backed-up impact from the revenue side from just this a bit of a hiatus that some of our customers have taken. But they're positioned for good growth with their backlog. They had superb winning capture rates. So they fit very nicely and comfortably right now in their market space. Jon Raviv : And just as a follow-up can you talk about how customer conversations in that business might be developing in the current environment where there might be more focus on this aggregated workforces further acceleration of the cloud, further IT monetization, larger implementation of CDC, NIH type work packages. So any sort of thinking about how the national priorities might shift or accelerate coming out of this. Phebe Novakovic : I don\u2019t know that we have seen anything that one could realistically discern a trend from. I think it's too early. As far as the distributed workforce I think that's way too early. I think we have to look at the efficiency metrics on how that actually plays out as they say a lot of our people need to be on customer sites. But we haven't seen a wholesale strategic or structural shift in the way that our customer is thinking about, either the cloud or its mission in a post COVID environment. I suspect naturally there will be some. Again as we think about how long do we keep social distancing, how long do we keep distancing, how long the integrated shifts and rolling shifts. So I think, some of that will play out, but so far I haven't seen a material of structural change in how our customer is thinking about their mission. Howard Rubel : And then we have one final question, operator. Operator : And that question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Jason, maybe this one is for you, given the free cash flow, can you revisit some of the dynamics of the 85% to 90% conversion in 2020 it seems the Canada payments are intact. So that's still about a $1 billion and what are other changes to working capital perhaps with either progress payments or inventories? Is it fair to assume that Gulfstream was may be $500 million or so of inventories in Q1 given you couldn\u2019t deliver 11 aircrafts? Jason Aiken : Sure. I think you\u2019ve picked up on a number instantly on a number of the drivers here. The two $500 million payments on the Canadian program were inherent in our forecasts of those coming in is certainly welcome news to solidify that element of the outlook. When you think about the defense side of the business and some of the accelerated contract payments progress payment rates have moved from 80% to 90% and some other advance mechanisms we're seeing. As I mentioned most if not all of that is essentially flowing through to the supply chain. So that's really sort of a net pass when it comes to the outlook. So bottom line really when you think about the overall impact, it really is at Gulfstream and it's that portion of the production out or I should say the production rate down. When you think about it, we were expecting to start this year with sort of the inflection point on working through some of the inventory working capital at Gulfstream between the test airplane deliveries and getting 500 and 600 up to a more steady state production level with these production shifts that sort of pushes that out call it 6 to 12 months and so the inflection point on that working capital drawdown at Gulfstream will just push out some somewhat. So that's really the driver in the difference on the free cash flow conversion. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you and Chad thank you and everyone else for being on this call today.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard and good morning all. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me briefly discuss how COVID-19 is continuing to impact us. We continue in a professional and proactive way to create a safe work environment for our people adhering to CDC guidelines, encouraging social distancing and instituting a company-wide mandatory mask policy. We temperature screen our employees and send those home who fail. These procedures have ensured that we have lower infection rates than the locales in which we operate. Of our over 100,000 employees globally we have had 515 cases to-date less than one half of 1%. As you would expect we continue to incur significant  in addition  considerable program impacts which we estimate to be around $127 million by the end of the second quarter. The most significant impact appears that later in my remarks. On the good news front with respect to Congress all of our major programs are well supported in the congressional markups of the defense funding bills. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I will date comparisons that are well stated in the exhibits to the press release and focus my remarks on the operations and the significant non-recurring items in the quarter. Regarding the company's second quarter performance as you can discern from my press release we reported earnings of $2.18 per fully diluted share on revenues of $9.26 billion operating earnings of $841 million and net income of $625 million. As one would expect revenue was down $291 million or 3% against the second quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $249 million or $22.8% and net earnings were down $181 million. The defense side of the business was down very modestly against the year ago quarter and even less year-to-date. For the defense business in the first half revenue is down only six tenths of a percent and operating earnings are down 3.7% on a 30 basis point lower operating margin. Most of the revenue and earnings challenges in shortfall occurred at GDIT and in our aerospace segment which was particularly impacted by jet aviation. I will comment on this in considerable detail later in my remarks. We experience solid growth at combat systems and marine systems in both the quarter and the first half along with declines in revenue at GDIT and mission systems in part caused by the divestiture of our  business mission systems. However, mission systems had growth and operating earnings for both the quarter and the half on significantly improved operating margins. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will start with some observations about our balance sheet and liquidity position following our first full quarter of operations influenced by the pandemic. We generated free cash flow of $622 million in the quarter a 100% net earnings conversion and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion. Importantly, operating working capital remained essentially flat during the quarter even as we've advanced in excess of $1.1 billion to our suppliers to support their liquidity compared with approximately $360 million advanced to us by our customers over the same period. Phebe Novakovic : Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast as I promised at the end of the first quarter in an effort to be as granular as possible in the midst of significant uncertainty. Our aerospace forecast given to you at the end of the last quarter appears to be holding fairly well. We expect about $100 million less in revenue than forecast 90 days ago roughly $8.4 billion and operating earnings of $1.13 billion that is about $20 million less than I gave you 90 days ago. Given everything at work here these are very modest changes. With respect to the defense businesses the impact is now more apparent. We're holding our full-year targets for combat systems for both revenue and earnings. Marine systems has about $200 million of sales pressure but it is holding its earning target even assuming an extended strike at Bath. Mission systems is also holding its revenue and earnings forecast with the exception of the $150 million of divested revenue that Jason discussed. Finally, GDIT has identified between $300 million and $400 million of revenue degradation and $130 million reduction in forecasted earnings including the $40 million charge on the international program I discussed previously. So on a company-wide basis we see annual revenue of about $38.4 billion and operating earnings of about $4.2 billion. This rolls to an EPS of $11 to $11.10 about a $0.30 reduction from what we forecasted at the end of the first quarter. All in all we weathered the storm of the second quarter reasonably well. This will be the low point of the year as we and many of the analysts had anticipated. Finally, as you can see from the highlights pro forma chart we've provided with the earnings release absent COVID the underlying operations of the company are quite solid with double-digit first half EPS growth. That concludes my remarks and I will turn the call back to Howard for questions. Howard Rubel : Thank you Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : Absolutely sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Jason, Phebe last quarter you highlighted a lot of details around just kind of the health of the Gulfstream backlog. You also mentioned a couple defaults that you expected that might come back. Maybe you could just give us an update on what you're seeing regarding kind of the health of the customers and what are you seeing on the -- regarding the sales cycle? I know you mentioned that there was quite challenge this quarter. Phebe Novakovic : So our backlog is holding up pretty strongly which is in marked contrast to 2008-09 for example where the backlog experienced some significant erosion. While it's very difficult to sell airplanes in fact impossible over the telephone. We were in constant contact with our customers who expressed the same needs and the same requirements as they had going into -- going into this downturn but look implied in your question I think is a little bit about the demand environment. So let me talk to you a little bit about that. As I said we've continued to talk to our customers and we continue to see their interests much the same. We rebuild our backlog but this isn't we've held our backlog and rebuilt our pipeline but this is an interesting downturn. Unlike previous downturns, this one is not driven by anything in the economy itself or in the economies of the world itself. It's driven by an exogenous force impacting the economies with closure and summonses of entire sectors and certainly slowdowns among many others. So that means I believe that it is very hard to predict with any level of certainty and assurance what that economic recovery looks like across the world including most particularly the United States. So when we look at where we are right now at Gulfstream we've seen the beginning of it what would appear to be an increase in demand but it's way too soon to be able to tell the slope of that recovery. Peter Arment : Yes. And just as a follow-up to that Phebe is there any, has there been any pickup in defaults or is it still been holding as expected? Phebe Novakovic : Holding as expected but I think we had five in the quarter but holding up pretty darn well. We haven't seen many defaults. That as I said differentiates this downturn from all of the other two or the two that I lived through the 2001 tech bubble and then 08/09. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Well, I apologize. It looks like our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning guys. Phebe could you give us an update on what's going on at Bath Iron Works because I know there was some labor stuff and some work disruption if you could update us there? Phebe Novakovic : So we are working quite closely with the federal appointed mediator. So I think it's best to be somewhat quiet at this time, silent at this time but I would note that across our company we have many-many union partners and in all respects we have very strong decades-long positive working relationships with them. This union appears unfortunately be the one exception. So we just need to work through this and as I said because we're working with the mediator, I think we're best to sort of say nothing at the point but in any case, given their size and the fact that they all are smart shipyard they really had an immaterial impact on the quarter. Ron Epstein : Got you and then maybe the one follow-up on land systems. Have you seen much of an impact yet are you expecting to see much of an impact on the COVID, on the international portion of that business be it that for some countries the spending that they're doing to stimulate their economies potentially COVID impact on spending? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So if you're talking about in the quarter, I think it was pretty clear about what those impacts were but in terms of the demand, first of all that we don't see any of our in production vehicles being impacted in the slightest. I mean these are highly performing programs that are very much in demand by our international customers. On a going forward basis, we still see that the demand, it's interesting, it's been my and you and I have talked about this it's been my long-held view that whether it's in the United States or in any of our allied nations that demand is really driven by the threat of the perception of threat and in all respects, I think there's a general consensus that the threat has not dissipated. In fact arguably some of our potential adversaries have become, have raised additional questions. So I think with respect to our overseas markets, I see a fair amount of stability right now. We'll see going forward but not hearing a lot at the grassroots level on any pending economic or any pending in defense cuts. Operator : And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So Phebe, good for Gulfstream given the $42 million in severance, kind of as I go through the mix, I have a little trouble getting to your number was there a big cut back in R&D and SG&A or were the accrual rates on any of the newer programs 500/600 increased in the quarter. Phebe Novakovic : So look we are, in the quarter we had the severance. We had lower R&D. We expect that to continue in the year really as a result of some of the right sizing we're doing and we had disadvantageous as I noted in my remarks mix. There were several 650s to international customers that because of, it entirely because of COVID travel related restrictions we couldn't deliver. So I think if you add those up along with the pre-owned you'll see that sort of gets you to the number. That helps? Cai von Rumohr : A little bit. Last question when you look at -- Phebe Novakovic : Come on Cai, I miss the question somehow. Cai von Rumohr : Well, no I mean, so R&D was a lot lower is that I mean because you did have the disadvantageous mix? What I am trying to say is that I was surprised the profit was as strong as it was given the severance and I guess you answered it when you said lower? Phebe Novakovic : Well, okay I am sorry. I misunderstood. So the underlying operations are quite effective and in fact on a production level we are really humming nicely. So I think that was a significant contribution. I know it was a significant contribution to our costs. Like we've been -- as you know we took some charges that we needed to take. We had some mix issues but this company performed beautifully operationally and that's reflected in and what we consider to be in the environment a pretty good margin. Cai von Rumohr : And just a quick follow-up, when you look at demand for your products, can you give us some characterization in terms of where is the interest coming? For example, is it coming from international, from domestic, high net worth corporate buyers? Any color would be great. Phebe Novakovic : So as I noted, Europe and the far East has been pretty active. In the United States, we talk to all of our customers and potential customers quite frequently but we've been a little slower to get back into the order execution phase though the interest remains quite intense and their needs are the same; nothing has changed about that. This is just a question of timing. We've got to get some of the economic uncertainty behind us but look, we entered this downturn in a very strong position with the best portfolio of products unmatched by any with a great service, the best in the industry service and support business and by far the strongest financial position. So given that nothing is materially changed that we can see in the nature of the orders on a going forward basis, we expect to emerge out of this stronger even than when we went in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey thanks very much and good morning. Jason, I was wondering what's the appropriate level of working capital for across General Dynamics that you guys can potentially settle out on at some point in the future and ideally if you could express it as a percentage of sales? Jason Aiken : Yes. I don't know that I'd peg it as a percentage of sales so much that it's clearly at this point at an elevated state. We probably I think over the past couple years about what we're seeing in the combat systems group, particularly on the large international program as you're well aware at the beginning of this year. We'll see that continue I think in a more accelerated way over the next two three years. So that'll have a good tailwind to it in terms of reducing the working capital level and then the other big piece of course is Gulfstream. As we've talked about when you're in a mode of introducing new models that naturally comes with a working capital build associated with the test articles as well as the initial production ramp and inventory of those models and then as you get them into full rate production you start to see that inflection point and see that turn. We had been expecting that to happen this year but of course with the disruptions that we've seen associated with the pandemic that has caused the production and delivery schedule to move a little bit to the right and as a result I think the inflection point with the working capital moves a little bit to the right but we ought to see that start to come down reasonably starting at some point in the next year and compounding that with the combat systems\u2019 improvements in working capital, I think those two big muscle movers will see us having a good favorable impact to our free cash flow performance over the next two three years. Seth Seifman : All right. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, maybe you could talk to the second half implied margin transit at aerospace obviously pretty robust bounce back and maybe talk about what that means for \u201821? Is this 15% that you're talking about in the second half, a road map to \u201821 in any way? Phebe Novakovic : So our margin performance this year and frankly into next will benefit significantly by the charges that we took and paid for in the quarter. So that is a significant benefit. We also see a more advantageous mix to our deliveries particularly if I am assuming that we don't get a worsening of international travel restrictions or we get zero abatement in them. So a path where we implied we've got a clear path to 70 to 75 deliveries as I said our operations are performing well. We have a plan to deliver each and every one of those airplanes. So we're comfortable in the moment that trajectory while steep is quite achievable. So going into \u201821 all the benefit from this year's cost reductions and rationalization will clearly benefit \u201821 margins. Myles Walton : So you could maintain the second half margins into \u201821 or maybe is that  -- Phebe Novakovic : Well, it's going to be a little lumpy and we're not going to, I am not going to start parsing \u201821 but you can imagine that they will benefit from them. Myles Walton : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Hey. Thank you. Good morning. Jason, following up on the cash generation question, can you talk about how the rest of the year shapes up and kind of what brings you into that range and then also obviously things should get better going forward to get back that the more consistent 100% with all that cash coming towards you though, what is the capital allocation thought and decision process going forward,  purchase any in second quarter but how's the capital allocation conversation going at this point? Jason Aiken : So as it relates to the outlook on cash I think you'll see this year frankly look quite similar to the way it's looked over the past couple years. It's a fairly steady and steep improvement in the free cash performance in the third and fourth quarters. That's become a more frankly typical pattern for us over the past several years and so you'll see a, I think a particularly strong fourth quarter and again, I think that has to do with some of that working capital starting to unwind in the fourth quarter and I think as I described in the earlier question we expect to see some of that working capital unwind in a more meaningful way into 2021 and frankly even \u201822 and \u201823. So those are really the underpinnings of where we see the free cash flow start to get to back -- not only back to 100% but we've been expecting it to get up above 100% as we look at it in the next couple years and it really is all about unwinding those elements of working capital. As it relates to capital deployment I will turn it back over to Phebe perhaps to answer that question. Phebe Novakovic : So I think in the moment in periods of great uncertainty preserving liquidity is the most important thing. We did not buy any shares in the quarter and we'll hold pat for now. With respect to that we'll continue to honor the dividend as we've told you for years. Our dividend is the one part of capital deployment that is repeatable and predictable. So that's all I think we're going to say about capital deployment at the moment. Jon Raviv : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Phebe, when you talk about right sizing the operations at Gulfstream in order to get the margins, get improved margins, how do you think about this medium to longer term? In other words, you're right sizing to a level but I would expect you certainly want the flexibility to take that rate up when demand re-emerges. So how do you balance the two things? Phebe Novakovic : So let me give you a little bit of color on how we set in any given year, the production rate and then we can talk a little bit more in detail. So and if we talk specifically about \u201921, the production rate in \u201821 will depend on the number of airplanes we have in the backlog for delivery in \u201821. The number of airplanes particularly in the third quarter of 2020 that we sell for delivery into third were into 2021 and then our -- how we see demand when we set our plan and all of this is done in the fall and it's part of a multi, it's been a long standing discipline process that we have had for a very long time. So look, that will give us some time if we need to increase our production schedule. We've got some flexibility around that our production plan for next year but it is way too soon to speculate about that but in any case is right sizing, I think that we've done are in many instances permanent. This was a good opportunity to just cut costs and I don't expect under any scenario for all of those costs to come back when revenue increases. Doug Harned : So this is something that would allow you to hopefully move margins up higher. One of the things that also, I wonder if we could understand a little better is when you think about the G700 and compare that to the G500, the G650, can you talk about how you're leveraging past designs, manufacturing processes and should we see margins rise on the G700 more quickly than these other new programs? Phebe Novakovic : I would expect that. That is unlike the other two a modification of an existing airplane. So all those lessons learned on the 650 we can apply to the 700 and you can expect us to do quite well as we come down a learning curve which will be obviously less steep. We know how to build this type of airplane. We've done it before. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Phebe Novakovic : Hi David. David Strauss : Phebe, on GDIT, what proportion of the business contracts or people actually need access to customer facilities and can actually just do the work from home? Phebe Novakovic : So let me put it to you this way. We've got about 10% of our workforce that is either idle or underutilized and a significant portion of that workforce is in classified area which has been a long-standing series of relationships we've had for many-many years and a good solid partnership that we have with our customers but as it's impossible to do classified work from home. So as our customers sort through how they judiciously and prudently bring back employees in this COVID environment and then how we manage now we augment all of that will sort of depend on going forward where we are. Now right now those costs are being covered by the CARES Act but with no margins. So they've been very dilutive to margin but ultimately this will resolve and it all depends on when our customers believe that they can get back and working at full steam once that some of the COVID uncertainties have been eliminated. David Strauss : Okay. Great. And could you give a little bit more color on the loss of jet? I guess what was unique about this situation jet as compared to I guess, the rest of your service business and then also the exposure to pre-owned that loss there? How does that mitigate going forward? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So jet was really about absorption. That was a headwind that we tend not to have in our other businesses. Revenue went down very, very quickly, there's only so and we can only take the fixed costs out so fast by any given schedule but as I said that will return. That was a one-time impact and they had disproportionately more higher severance charges given the nations in which they work. So that's I think an important element of that. And with respect to the pre-owned, we discipline our inventory of pre-owned very, very, very clearly and with very strict structures. So I don't see us having much material risk on this. This was in the quarter. We're not expecting any on a going forward basis but we'll let you know. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey thank you. Good morning. Phebe, can you talk a little bit about how the virus is impacting the fractional biz jet market? How it has impacted so far and any potential changes that you see in the landscape going forward out of this? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Look let the operators of the fractional businesses talk about that but on a going forward basis we do not see any structural change in this market. We simply don't and we see no evidence to suggest that there would be. Hunter Keay : Okay and I will just squeeze one more and just to follow up on the comment about the 700 margins. Are you suggesting that margins just to clarify can exceed peak margins on 650 -- Phebe Novakovic : I think that's a little too early to declare victory but let's just put it this way. Everything about this airplane is performing exactly as we hoped in fact better. We have over 100 hours of test on that airplane and it is all indications, all character in all respects is outperforming in some of our specifications. So why does that matter because we really understand this airplane and I think it's premature to say we understand how to build it but it's very premature to say at this juncture that we're going to eclipse those margins but as we get closer to the in-service we get this through tests, we get it through the certification process and we'll have a little bit more color about the timing of the margins and earnings associated with that airplane going forward but this is going to be a very good airplane for us. Operator : Thank you and our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Pete Skibitski :  Good morning guys. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Pete Skibitski : Phebe, it looks like you're expecting some back half of your margin expansion at combat relative the first half. I am just wondering is that the Spanish facilities coming online or is there some mixed benefit potentially and -- Phebe Novakovic : So we always ramp in the last half of the year. That's that businesses pattern but really as you quite accurately point out it's at our European land systems but we've got those facilities up and they're at near peak production. So that's behind us with respect to that. Pete Skibitski : Okay and just, I have lost track of this but the big Spanish and Morocco combat vehicle programs, when you expect to have those under contract if they're not yet? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I have learned not to speculate on the timing of sovereign governments. I had decisions but I will tell you that we're going to get this and it'll be a nice addition to the backlog. Pete Skibitski : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Howard Rubel : And then operator we'll take one more question. This upcoming one will be our last please. Operator : Yes sir. And our final question today will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on aerospace. I was wondering if you could tell us what you've been seeing on some of the more short cycle parts of this division such as the aftermarket services in terms of trends in recent months or the FBOs and then secondly pricing. You commented on what you've seen in this down cycle versus previous cycles, how is pricing held up this time versus what you've seen in the past? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen really no degradation in pricing and as you well know we consider price pressure. So we do not compete on price. We never have and that doesn't change in this kind of environment. So our pricing is holding up pretty well. With respect to the shorter cycle aerospace businesses look those are really volume driven and entirely at the FBO it's volume driven. So the more flying hours we get across all models of airplane the better the FBOs do. Service; services was down but only slightly. It may be a little bit mercurial through the rest of the year but we will have nice performance on service and we expect the mix to improve as well. It was hard for in the second quarter for people to get some of their airplanes in for scheduled maintenance. Most of the scheduled maintenance we did but some of these guys -- it was they couldn't travel. So hard to get the airplane that will resolve. Robert Stallard : Thank you. Howard Rubel : Thank you. Operator we now end this call and thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder please refer to General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions I can be reached 703-876-3117. Operator : Thank you sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Rocco  and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Howard and good morning. Before I address the company's quite good performance in the quarter, let me briefly update you on COVID-19's continuing impact. As we discussed last quarter, we're working hard to protect our people. We adhere to CDC guidelines, encourage social distancing and have a mandatory mask policy. We continue to have lower infection rates in our surrounding communities. To-date of our 100,000 employees, we've had about 1,800 cases. 1,500 of whom have fully recovered and are back to work while many of the others are working from home, during their quarantine. In short, the pandemic remains an issue. But we've dealt with the help of our workforce in effective way and continue to do so. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I'll spend less time on quarter over year ago quarter and year-to-date comparisons that are well stated in Exhibit's A and B to the press release. And instead focus my remarks on operations, the significant sequential improvement and meaningful development in the quarter. Regarding the company's third quarter performance as you can discern from our press release. We've recorded earnings of $2.90 per diluted share on revenue of $9,430 million operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net income of $834 million all very significant improvements over the second quarter. As one would expect, revenue was down $330 million or 3.4% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $132 million or 10.9% and net earnings were down $79 million. For the temps  businesses alone the year-to-date revenue is up $98 million and operating earnings are down only $51 million. All up, the defense business has been seriously impacted but is holding up and recovering well as you will see in the details. As you all are aware most of the revenue and earnings shortfall this year to-date has occurred in our aerospace segment which saw significant write-off last quarter associated with reductions and force at both Gulfstream and jet aviation. However, there's mostly good news for both companies this quarter which I'll get into shortly. But before I get into the details of the operating level particularly at aerospace and GDIT where we experience significant improvement. I want to spend a moment on the resilience and strength of the company's backlog. Total backlog of $81.5 billion is down $1.1 billion against the end of last quarter. Funded backlog at $60.2 billion is down only $950 million. However, total estimated contract of $132 billion is down only $336 million against the end of last quarter. While these numbers are down slightly, they represent a solid and enduring backlog. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with some comments on our cash performance in the quarter and our latest thinking on how the year is shaping up. Cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $903 million, 108% conversion rate. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $11.9 billion down almost $400 million from the second quarter. As anticipated when we started the year, the cash performance has stepped up markedly in each sequential quarter this year and consistent with that original expectation we have a big fourth quarter ahead of us. That said, our forecast for the quarter is right in line with what the fourth quarter has looked like in each of the past three years, so not an unusual task at this point. So with that at backdrop, we continue to target free cash flow for the year to be in 80% to 85% of net income range. The biggest variables in achieving that mark will be Gulfstream order activity and our ongoing efforts to support our supply chain as we settle on production and delivery rates for next year. You heard Phebe's remarks on that subject so assuming things continue to trend favorably as we've seen of late, we've got a path to close on our cash target for the year. On the defense side, our Pentagon customer continues to lean forward with accelerated contract payments to support the industrial base and we in turn continue to do the same for our supply chain. Through the end of the third quarter, we've received approximately $400 million of accelerated payments from our customers and advanced more than $1.7 billion to our suppliers. To the extent, we eventually see additional relief from our US government customer in the form of incremental contract funds to offset the ongoing impact of COVID to our business. We'll include the benefit of that relief in our results only when it's authorized and funds are made available. As I mentioned earlier, our net debt is down to just below $12 billion and our interest expense in the quarter was $118 million versus $114 million in the third quarter of 2019. That brings the interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $357 million roughly unchanged from $350 million for the same period in 2019. At this point, we expect interest expense for the year to be approximately $480 million. Howard Rubel : Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco , would you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : Absolutely. Today first question comes from Ron Epstein with BoA. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : I'm sorry there'll be a bunch of questions on Gulfstream, so I'll just start with defense. Right, I'll leave those for other folks. In the naval business I know there's been some discussions, some whispers about a III Virginia-class. What do you think of that? Is that a possibility? And what that means for you guys, if that happens? And then I have one follow-up after that. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so we've been talking to our Navy customer about the ability of - essentially the supply chain and the facilities to ramp up production and as you can imagine, we're developing plans to do that as well. But you'll note that in all of the recent discussions about US National Security strategy and particularly the Navy's articulation of the criticality of the size of its fleet submarines figure prominently in all of those conversations because they remain a national competitive advantage for the United States. So we'll continue to work with our customer and we'll see where that takes us at the moment. We're not planning for that increase. But if the nation needs it, we'll accommodate it. Ron Epstein : And then my follow-up is kind of dovetail's in one of our comments. When you look at there's been discussion, I guess Secretary Esper was talking about 550-foot  Navy, a portion of that is unmanned under sea vehicles. What opportunities that present for General Dynamics? Phebe Novakovic : Well let's think about in two parts. In the first instance, it's the job of our shipyards to integrate those capabilities into the existing platforms and we're very good as you can imagine that integrating mission payloads into our ships and our submarines. With respect to individual lines of business within the unmanned world. Mission systems has a number of lines of business that have been very active for quite some time in the undersea domain and unmanned under sea domain, so I would imagine those continue to grow. It's all going to be about performance and their performance throughout testing has been outstanding. So I think there's a lot more to come on that. Ron Epstein : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : The aerospace impact of $541 million of COVID. What do you base that on? Is that deliveries you plan to do, that you didn't do? And then given that it looks like the decremental margins on the revenue you missed were 22%. Would the profitability value soon  the profitability would have been even better if you've gotten most deliveries? Phebe Novakovic : So think about what we did, very quickly in response to COVID. We lowered our production. We did it in two respects. One, to better meet demand but very importantly to allow the supply chain to catch up so that is really what has driven all of the - overriding factor that's driven all of the performance at Gulfstream. Now within that, we've also quite predictably and as we've told right sized that business and we'll continue to do so. So that we manage our margins and nearly push them to be as high as they can. So I think Gulfstream has done a remarkable job in bringing down its cost both for restructuring and then cost savings and productivity. So with respect to the profitability of Gulfstream I think we've seen really some good discipline actions to size the business supportingly  and then continue to perform superbly on the manufacturing line. Cai von Rumohr : And then the last one, Jason mentioned he had $400 million at advances COVID cares related and yet you advanced a $1.70 billion  supplier or so, so that's a delta or like a $1.3 billion when do you expect to recover that? When do you expect that to burn down to near zero? Jason Aiken : So Cai, keep in mind that's an accumulative number that's been building throughout the year and so that sort of paves in and then it gets phased out and paid in and phased out overtime. That said, you'll note if you look at our cash flow statement and our exhibits our receivables and unbilled receivables in the quarter as well as payables and on the supply side. Continue to be a bit of an OWC  headwind for us and that's really all attributable to lot of that timing. So I think you'll see that phased out as this pandemic starts to abate and the customer sort of moves its payment practices back to normal and we'll in kind sort of move back to normal cadence from our perspective. In the meantime, our priority is to make sure that our supply chain which is, we're all in a symbiotic relationship here and what's good one for is good for other, we've got to continue to support the elements of that supply chain that needed particularly on the smaller business side and so we're going to continue to do that as the impact of the pandemic continues. Operator : And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : First of all, perhaps on GDIT. You had quite a few comments there Phebe about the demand environment, the bidding that this business has been doing. Have we finally turned the corner in this division? And can we expect revenues to accelerate from here and to hold onto this operating margin? Phebe Novakovic : The operating margin - we'll take that in inverse orders was severely decremented last quarter by a loss that we had on a legacy GDIT program as well as the impact of COVID. And if you recall, we had significant number of our workforce to were covered under the CARES Act and Jason I don't know if you recall those numbers, but it was a lot of revenue that carried in the earnings . Jason Aiken : About $150 million in the quarter. Phebe Novakovic : So those are considerable headwinds GDIT has from the very get go, had superior industry leading and not by a little, but by a lot EBITDA margins and I would expect that performance to continue. Here's a predicate that we finally turned the corner. We can quibble over the predicate. But let me just give you some idea of what's going on the order front at GDIT. In the quarter our overall win rate is an excess of 75%, our re-compete win rate was over 90% and I think it is really just a positive factor that in the third quarter with our largest quarter over 50% of the awards coming from competitive new work. And so I think that's an important indicator of this business on a going forward basis. We had a number of nice enduring wins in the quarter. our performance has been very, very strong on our existing contracts. So I very much like where this business is and again, they've continued to have outstanding cash performance. Robert Stallard : Okay and then on the aerospace division. I was wondering if you could give us any clarity on the order intake in terms of whether any differences by model or by region that were notable in the third quarter. Phebe Novakovic : Well I think I noted in my remarks that the 650 led the order book. That has been an extraordinarily successful airplane and continues to endure and successfully endure. So internationally, we saw more of a pickup. I was pretty I think fulsome in my remarks about the demand environment. But we saw good order activity internationally. Robert Stallard : That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Carter Copeland : Phebe, I wondered if you might talk a little bit about the performance at EB. I'm pretty intrigued by the margins given the COVID cost that you've outlined year-to-date. I mean obviously those come through the reimbursement of those, the treatment there, just implies you guys have found some performance efficiencies there. I wondered if you could speak to that. Phebe Novakovic : So electric boat had continued to find and will continue to find performance improvement as well as cost cutting. This is a very efficient yard that's getting better and better at what they do. So I expect their performance to continue and as I noted in my remarks, we're - all of that top line growth we're going to push for margin expansion. We're going to see bottom line growth that the more that we can accelerate that bottom line growth, the better and that's all about productivity and efficiency at electric boat and they've done a superb job in the last four quarters even within this environment of driving productivity improvements. If you think about it and this is just not with respect to the shipyard, but across all of our operating divisions. The COVID has amplified the underlying strength of the operations in this business to the extent that they're driven by disciplined, continuous improvement that helped manage any crisis including this pandemic. So we're continuing to see each and every one of our businesses improved their bottom line performance on the operating side. Now we've long talked about that the strong operations are the key to financial success that and good contract bidding. So I think you'll continue to see this march toward productivity improvements in electric boat is leading the win. More to come. Carter Copeland : Okay, great. Thank you for the color. Operator : And our next question today comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Richard Safran : Phebe, just a quick. You discussed portfolio shaping in your opening comments. so I wanted to get your thoughts on future portfolio shaping. Are you considering any further divestitures or additions to the portfolio? Do you think that there are any holes in the portfolio right now that you need to fill? Just any color you can provide on just how you're thinking about it right now? Phebe Novakovic : Richard, I know how much you like that but you know I think - portfolio shaping is only effectively discussed after the fact. So we're always looking for opportunities to improve and focus our activities. But it's really no comment in the moment. There's really nothing on our horizon at the moment. We're sticking to our operations doing what we do best. Richard Safran : Okay and as a follow-up at mission. You noted expansion into naval air and electronic systems. I want to know if you could elaborate on that a bit more versus share gains, new contract wins versus expansion into new markets, just any color you could provide there. Phebe Novakovic : These are really within our four, that we've had continuing contract wins and that is a business where we've done a fair amount of portfolio shaping because they've got some nice growth in looking at in front of them. I talked about those cyber defense, tactical communications we have, a decades long history and expertise and in the nuclear triad that will continue to grow and missile fire control as well as short position navigation and timing. In a world where on the battlefield GSP reliability is questionable, that's a key and critical factor. That we have developed over quite some time and very strong expertise and so I think it's important when you see these really critical important franchises that you divest yourself of non-business  and that's exactly what we've done. Richard Safran : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : Phebe you mentioned earlier about leveraging the breadth of GD of a corporation for opportunities and there were some things that really stood right into that like unmanned, under sea. But when I think of General Dynamics over the long history, I thought of the units it's operating very independently driven by numbers within the unit. Does this suggest that you're thinking differently about how you manage from the corporate center? Phebe Novakovic : So look I believe in centers of excellence at the business units in which they concentrate on the really value creation levers at their disposal. That said, we have a long history of our units working together and mission systems in particular. They've heavily embedded in combat systems platform within the marine group and within GDIT. So we're moving increasingly in response to the market I might add increasingly working on joint activities between those two businesses and they worked well together, they blend well together. So there's no fundamental change in how we see our business across our portfolio. I really do think people excel when they stick to what they know, but when we have opportunities to augment that value creation through partnerships across the units, we've done - so we've done for over 20 years. Doug Harned : One of the opportunities could be in the area of 5G and you've won contracts both at GDIT and at mission systems related to that. Is this something that we should expect to see as a strong growth area and when might we see, if that's the case? Phebe Novakovic : Well I think the department is still working through - how to operationalize 5G? it is an enormous capability advantage for our Warfighter and we have been a part of both their planning and thinking it, at our customer levels for some time. And the way we define how we operate both in the moment and gloom for to how to meet our customer needs so as their need and the clarity around it's used, with respect to 5G in this instance gets increasingly clear. We'll be there to work with them. Doug Harned : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks for the color on Gulfstream as you looked out to 2021 deliveries. With regard to that, I think your forecasting $1.13 billion in EBIT in 2020, would you still expect some Gulfstream EBIT growth in 2021 despite lower deliveries? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let us continue to work that. But in addition to efficiency, the number of airplanes delivered really drive EBIT. So we've got a long way to go in determining what the final plan is. But I try to be very specific in my remarks about how to think about the delivery plan that we have at least at its current notional level. It's really the 550 has gone away and we're not able in this demand environment to replace it with new airplanes. But our new airplane models that we have anticipated. So the production is going to be very similar on our existing fleet, with a little bit of decrement on the mid-sized cabin. So I think that's all we can say in the moment about any specificity around the future. David Strauss : Okay and as a follow-up I guess Jason on free cash flow as we think about next year. How much potentially could that conversion number bump up? I mean is 100% conversion next year out of the question at this point. Jason Aiken : I don't want to say anything is out of the question, David. I think what we're focused on is growing free cash flow year-over-year and obviously the two major muscle movers there, that have really been all part of the operating working capital side of that story on the one, the combat systems international program we've told you, I think a good bit about that throughout this year and this is on a trajectory, it sort of set on a path with timing to eventually unwind that working capital over the next three years and then the other side obviously is Gulfstream with the inventory build that really is largely associated with three different aircraft models with test aircraft and the unwinding of that both those test aircraft as well as just general inventory build into the new aircraft models is all going to be predicated on the macroeconomic recovery and when that production rate gets back into full stride and starts to unwind that. So I don't want to put too many caveats around it. But I think the most important takeaway is we expect to see growing free cash flow year-over-year and we'll work out the details as to whether we get to 2% or above 100% as we were projecting before the pandemic. David Strauss : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Robert Springarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Springarn : Two quick ones, Phebe for you. I know you talked about Gulfstream demand but I just wanted to ask from one other angle. Has the customer mix lately since COVID changed between the number of high net worth individuals versus corporate buyers, so that's the first question on Gulfstream? Phebe Novakovic : Well let me address that, I talked about that in my remarks. That I think there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the economy, political uncertainty and then we still have highly restricted travel restrictions across the world. So that is an issue. That's going to affect corporate buyers, but as I also noted we're seeing international pick up is nice and high net worth individuals continue to be in the market. So as the economy's recovery. We'll see diminution in inflection rate. We'll see a pickup in all of that. Robert Springarn : But see what I'm getting at is, is the virus causing people I guess the high net worth group to want to travel privately, where they might not have before? Phebe Novakovic : Well I think it's driving motive to people is very difficult. But the high net worth individuals have always been an important part of our portfolio and they remain so. Robert Springarn : Okay and I had a quick one for Jason and that's just on mission systems and applied margin in Q4. It sounds like the guidance holds in the mid-14, so just what's driving that fourth quarter? Jason Aiken : I think what you're looking at there is mostly a mix issue for that business. As Phebe talked about as well with some of that portfolio shaping some of that is to get out of non-core businesses and by association in many cases, some less than desired margin businesses, so that has an uplift effect as well. So I think they're expecting to see a little bit of rebound and some pent-up demand that they've experienced over the past several months that will drive some of that product flow through which will bring some strong mix based incremental margin in the quarter. Operator : Thank you and our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Couple of quick questions was the book-to-bill of the 650 in the quarter above one. Phebe Novakovic : Well let's not parse that out for you, but it was quite wholesome. As I said that's a spectacular airplane that continues to be in demand. George Shapiro : Okay and then just one for you Jason, can you clarify a little bit the impact on the free cash from the $400 million that you received and you gave out $1.8 billion. I mean if I look at the balance sheet in Q3 it looks like between the working capital would have been $410 million worse  with receivables and unbilled receivables and etc. and so I'm just trying to reconcile what the actual impact on the cash in a quarter was from your earlier comment. Jason Aiken : Just to clarify George, I think the numbers you're quoting from the cash flow statement are pretty much en pointe as it relates to the impact of OWC in the quarter. the numbers on the payment advances and accelerations from our customers and to our suppliers. Keep in mind, that's not accumulative $1.3 billion of implied pent up cash on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter. as we're accelerating, this is what I was trying to get into on an earlier question. As we're accelerating cash to suppliers, we're helping keep them going on an ongoing basis from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. so if they've got implicit receivables that are due 60 days from now and we're accelerating that to paying immediately. Well 60 days later that payment was due and so that kind of comes off the balance sheet naturally. But cumulatively we've been accelerating overtime for call it the past five, six months in excess of $1.7 billion to those suppliers. So you've got to kind of reconcile that with the in the quarter what was the net billed of OWC which speaks to the numbers you were speaking to coming off the cash flow statement. so that's kind of how you reconcile those two concepts. Operator : And our next question today comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph DeNardi : Phebe, it wasn't too long ago that you used to provide kind of backlog duration by platform at Gulfstream. Would you be willing to provide that now just given some of the changes in build rates that you're seeing? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : That was appropriate when we had all existing long-term airplanes that had been in the backlog for some time. This is a whole new fleet and we're not going to start that until these have been in our production for some time. It is a material difference in the kinds of airplanes that we have, these are all new model and frankly as you all know we are the only airplane manufacturer with - we are truly clean sheet airplanes and it's best just to focus on how well we're doing in selling those. I think it is an important indicator that by the end of the fourth quarter, we're going to have 90 of these 500s and 600s in customers hand and let's not forget also we've got over 450, G650s out in the fleet. It's pretty impressive, if you ask me. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, yes understood. And then just on GDIT. I think the traditional metric that folks look at to kind of understand growth as book-to-bill and book-to-bill there, for you all is okay, is that expected . Phebe Novakovic :  on revenue. I think it's quite nice. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, so that's what you expect from that business going forward. There's not an expectation that book-to-bill improves materially there? Phebe Novakovic : We're going to have some variances over the quarter. but you know look there's - I wouldn't say that we don't expect book-to-bill to stay the same in perpetuity. It's all going to depend on the win rates in any given quarter and when the customer start deciding all of this enormous pent up backlog proposals, they've got in front of them. And as you can well imagine the velocity in which these contracting decisions are made on the part of the contracts or the part of the customers have slowed down by COVID. So we'll get through all of that and the key areas for us to win more than our fair share and this business is doing I think quite well in that regard. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Howard Rubel : Operator, we'll take one more question please. Operator : Absolutely and our final question today will come from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Phebe, I wonder if you could talk a little bit. I know you don't give multi-year guidance. But maybe in kind of a qualitative way. Thinking about the growth in marine that's going to be driven by Columbia, just so we have maybe some way to size the magnitude of that in the coming years and have some guardrails around it and are aware of the timing of any kind of occasionally we see, picks up and growth as programs move from development to production and kind of when those happen. Any additional color around that? Phebe Novakovic : So I think the way to think about the future and while this will be somewhat lumpy on a going forward quarterly basis. The fact that 50% of our growth this year has been in Columbia. I think it's a nice indicator of what this is going to mean to us in the future. Electric boats alone size will be double in the next five to six years. It's already quite a large business and it will continue to grow. This is a - as we've been talking about for sometime an enormous program of critical national importance and we've geared up to both the  to support it as well as prepared all of our manufacturing processes to support it. I'll give you one little note that to give you a sense of what's going to propel this growth. We go into production on Columbia with 80% of the construction drawings done compared to 43% on Virginia and Virginia was one-month successful program the department has ever seen. So that tells that all of the growth that's embedded in those current budget numbers and future year budget numbers within the Department of the Navy are going to be able to be capitalized by us in nice, nice top line growth and then as I noted. We'll continue to work on margin expansion. So we'll give you a sense of what next year looks like and overtime as we really get into the - in the fourth quarter call and overtime. If we really get into full rate production on Columbia. You'll get also lot of clarity on what the future looks like. Seth Seifman : Great, that's all from me today. Thanks very much. Operator : I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Rubel. Howard Rubel : Thank you very much for joining our call today and as a reminder. Please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions. I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results in comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest, it is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially. For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings diluted shares of $11, once again modestly below consensus. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the Board positions the Company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks. Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by three aircraft, two of which delivered after the first of the year, for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer, but it was not ready for delivery by year end, that one's on us. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income. To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020. In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time. And the Technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned, in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next three years. As part of that agreement, we received two payments of $500 million each last year and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind as we've discussed on past calls. Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales. You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is three years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plant at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations. Phebe Novakovic : With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast, and in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550 as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the three slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft, this reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first two cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line. We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more. So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020 and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperformed many operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021, leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter. Back to you, Howard. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask each participant one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Absolutely. today's first question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Raviv : Phebe, if you could just sort of talk -- I know you mentioned that you want to have this for the end of the first quarter, but you're starting a repo again in 4Q, looking at a much better conversion rate this year. Just sort of big picture on where free cash flow conversion goes this year and ahead, especially if you see a big recovery, a bigger recovery in 2022 and then kind of what the levers are for capital allocation as the year progresses with those debt repayments, but also saying that you might have some excess as well? Phebe Novakovic : Let me ask Jason to give you a little specificity there. Jason Aiken : Yes. So John, I think at a macro level, the best way to think about this is we have to think about this is we have every expectation that we will see year-over-year increases in our free cash flow. As you saw, we had a nice outperformance of our expectation in the fourth quarter to wrap up a pretty strong 2020. That set us off on this course a little quicker than we expected. A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. I think we expect to see those trends really continue. I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoy by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that that program continues at pace. And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, at which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address. Phebe Novakovic : So look, we've been real clear over the years that we invest in our business depending on the need and the expected return on that invested capital. The one element of capital deployment that should be repeatable, achievable, each and every -- and sustainable each and every year are dividends. We'll be discussing that with our Board. Obviously, debt repayment and then share repurchase. And let me just leave it at that. We have more work to do with our Board. But you can expect us to be good stewards of capital. Operator : And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : I asked this question a little sheepishly, but I wanted to go back to something you said about Aerospace. And you said, if you've been following our R&D spending, you know there's more to come on this subject. I like to think that I'm following it, but maybe if you could speak to that in a little more detail and what that means? Phebe Novakovic : So as you and I agree that I gave you as much detail as I intend to here. So why don't we find another question to discuss together? Seth Seifman : Okay, maybe on the cash flow then. Jason, it looks like we're moving from 2 9 in 2020 to maybe about 3 1 in 2021. Can you talk about the key moving pieces there, especially working capital and they ended the year with a very low receivables balance, and sort of, is working capital overall going to be a contributor and so to the extent it can continue to decline? Jason Aiken : Yes. I think to cut to the chase. I think you put your finger on it. It is the continued working of that OWC. It's partially receivables, you saw some good movement there in the fourth quarter of last year, but that should continue as well as the inventory side of things. We'll get to unloading these test articles, a Gulfstream over the balance of this year and into early next year. So that will be a big help as well. And that will continue in terms of the OWC turn, not just through the balance of this year, but it will be a big mover in 2022 and 2023 as well. Operator : And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. So Phebe, you mentioned Q4 initial deliveries of the G700. I think at one point, it looked like G700 was going to be early in the year. I know a lot has happened obviously with MAX and COVID. How confident are you that you can really hit that delivery bogey? And what does that assume in terms of certification? Phebe Novakovic : So Cai, I think if we go back and look at the record, we've been pretty consistent that it would be toward the end of 2022. And the test program, all the test points, the expectation of the airplane throughout its test program has met all of our design specification. So the program is going very, very well. And we will work with the FAA on certification prior to the entry into service. But the progress of the test program supports end of year 2022. Cai von Rumohr : What I mean you said you're going to expect an up year in '22. How many G700s? What if the G700 slips into '23, is it an up year or a down year? Phebe Novakovic : Well, look, our expectations are predicated on a recovery in the market that will drive fundamentally all of Gulfstream's performance. But we're pretty much counting on the 700. And if it is, it would be by a quarter or so, but I don't believe that that's the case at the moment. And so what we do is in work with our FAA teammate and made the best estimates that we can for one, we believe this is going to enter into service. We're not going to get into the number of production and deliveries by model we never have or not going to. But that airplane is coming, and it comes with nice margin performance and good cash. So our expectation, I think, is reasonable given all the fat patterns we have an evidence at the moment. And if it changes, of course, we'll let you know, but we have nothing to believe at the moment that it will change. Operator : And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Phebe, you mentioned that there's been some commentary around the G650 and the market demand for this aircraft. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the sort of slot availability is for this plane, looking out over the next 12 months or two years? And whether you're seeing any sign of the G700 cannibalizing the market? Phebe Novakovic : So the 650, as I've noted, continued to be in demand. It is a powerful airplane. There's nothing close to it in its market. We are not going to get into open slots. We've never really done that with any specificity, and we're not going to start now. Just suffice it to say, we don't build strings and white tails. But look, we've talked about this a couple of times and just to refresh, the 700 and the 650 have materially different missions and there are at different price points and the customers well understand the distinction. And I think the parable to think about to amplify that point is that when we announced the 700, 650 demand increased because of the clarity provided in that market space. So that was a -- it was additive, not subtractive. So we believe that, that pattern will continue given the differentiation between the two airplanes. Does that help you? Robert Stallard : Yes. And just as a follow-up. On the G650, you did bring the rate down there modestly. Do you see that now as a sustainable rate over the next few years? Or could it actually head higher again? Phebe Novakovic : We are comfortable with the rate that we're looking at the moment. But look, you've seen us sufficiently agile to adjust on the up. I don't expect that at the moment. We still have very good demand. Our rate supports that demand and the demand supports that rate. And we anticipate a nice steady order book and production schedule for the time to come. So we're really pleased with that airplane. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Phebe, I just wanted to touch on Marine and the growth that you're forecasting there. I think you said there's potential upside, but looks like your forecast about 3% top line growth. I know it's on a tough comp. Can you just talk about where the potential upside could come from? How much Columbia is accounting for of that growth? And would you expect Marine's growth rate to reaccelerate once we get beyond 2021? Phebe Novakovic : So, the growth is -- can be on any given year, a bit lumpy, but the trajectory is there, supported by that backlog. I think this year, in 2020, I think Colombia accounted for 50% of that growth. But the way to think about this in crudely approximately from a trajectory perspective is, we're looking between $400 million to $500 million of growth a year. And then that will continue to accelerate as we pull through more production. So in the moment for 2021, as I alluded to in my remarks, the opportunity there is for increased revenue. And that happens in these shipyards by increased throughput. We pull work in, depending on the work cadence, the schedule, the planning, the availability. So that is in the moment. If any upside comes to growth in 2021, it will be based on that. But you are quite right, we -- that comparison base is off for this year is very, very strong growth. But there's nothing to suggest that there's any particular issue here. It's simply just the timing and the mix. David Strauss : Right, the $400 million to $500 million that you just referenced, is that the annual revenue increase that you're expecting out of Columbia per year for the next couple of years? Phebe Novakovic : No, the whole group. David Strauss : Okay, got it. And then on Combat, can you -- may be split it out kind of what you're seeing on the U.S. side versus Europe? And are you having any issues in Europe given some of the shutdowns that we've seen over there? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let's talk about the U.S. As we've talked about, we are the premier systems integrator for combat systems platforms in the United States. And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization, it comes in two flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue.  And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, we deliver things on time at cost. That puts us in very good stead, along with the Technologies investments we've been making over the last four, five, six years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight. So, I feel good about that. On top of that, in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents, on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So, these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States. When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the Ajax program that has just begun its testing. So, we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service lab-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous. And it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So, we expect ELS to grow and the world hasn't got any safer and that reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So, I hope that gives you a little bit of color here. Operator : And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Phebe, I noticed when you call out 0.96 book-to-bill, that's a gross number. So, it looks like there were like $244 million of cancellations in the quarter, if you could specify what they actually were? Phebe Novakovic : So, look, we still have a very low default rate that's really not meaningful either in the moment for us or going forward. So, we're not going to give you a model by model. I can tell you nothing particularly surprised us. And it signifies for us at the moment, really nothing on a going-forward basis. Does that help? George Shapiro : Not as much as I'd like. Phebe Novakovic : I'm sure. Do you think I want to start to  backlog. You . George Shapiro : I can figure, but I figured I'd ask anyway. And then my other question is the sequential backlog at Technologies dropped like 6% and this sector continued to disappoint again in revenues, as you mentioned. So, what's really going on there? I mean, I mean we've seen this for quite a while at this time. Phebe Novakovic : So, look we had anticipated going into 2020 that we would see the growth that we had expected. COVID derailed it back a bit. But as we do our planning and think through how we are going to manage COVID going forward and the advance of COVID, at some point in the year, we see that growth in supported by that backlog. And again, I think Jason gave you a very fulsome explanation of how we treat our backlog, and we do that differently than anybody else. And I think we sometimes get penalized for it, but we have the backlog to support growth that we are anticipating. Jason Aiken : And George, just to add another fine point, and I alluded to this a little earlier, but I want to make sure it's clear. This business, in particular, I think, is the most relevant to pay attention to that total potential contract value versus the -- strictly the traditional firm-funded backlog. And the reason is, I think I mentioned this earlier, this business year in and year out, 50% or more, and in fact, I think in 2020 was 60% of their annual orders and revenue value, comes out of that bucket of value that we articulate as IDIQ/options potential contract value. So that's very different than the pure-play platform businesses that have the traditional contracting firm backlog and so on. And so, I don't think it can be overlooked and in fact, it should be emphasized and should be the focal point of analysis on where that value is coming from and to Phebe's point, what's supportive of our expectations of growth for that business. George Shapiro : But even Jason, on that basis, it was still down somewhat sequentially, if I looked at the total number that you gave. Jason Aiken : So there's pieces of that, there's Mission Systems and GDIT in there. GDIT was actually up, I believe, in fact, I think in like 10% or 11%, between you and me. And again, to reiterate what I discussed earlier, when we get these large programs, think of DOs as an example, it's a potential $4.4 billion program, not even a small fraction of that went into even that IDIQ bucket. So major resolution of a significant headline award, so you're not yet seeing manifest in the backlog or even in the IDIQ bucket, but will over time support the fundamental underpinnings of the growth that we're alluding to, so a pretty conservative approach to it, but we think appropriate, and you'll see measured out over time as those programs progress. Operator : Our next question today comes from Doug Harned at Bernstein. Please go ahead. Doug Harned : In the GDIT emission systems, I mean, once upon a time they were together and you split them up, and now they're coming back again. Could you talk a little bit about the evolution of your thinking about these businesses? And I know earlier, you talked about these integrated systems where they can work together. And perhaps you could highlight some of the programs that of the programs that are opportunities for you in that kind of work? Phebe Novakovic : So we have -- look, you would expect us to remain agile to changing trends in the marketplace. And what we were observing is that while our services business and even the older incarnation of Mission Systems work closely together across a number of programs. Increasingly, in the last three years, we're seeing more and more of that. They're working together on bids. They're submitting bids together. And that -- what I've liked about that, these are two separate businesses managed separately. They understand each other. The guys who at Mission Systems know how to run their product portfolio, and the guys at GDIT know how to manage their IT work together business in the last three years, we're are opportunities for you in are two separate businesses managed separately. They services business. And I think those areas of expertise, it's very important to keep them separate from a management point of view. To have them come together to work more seamlessly, we believe this reporting structure helped. But no other respects are we changing anything. So we have a -- Howard, can give you a pretty definitive list, but Jason could give you a few of just the indicative kinds of programs we're looking at. Jason Aiken : Doug, it's going to come across if we get into this in too much detail sounding like a bunch of alphabet soup just based on the nature of these businesses. But suffice it to say, it is an increasing portfolio of opportunities where they're going to market together, including work on areas like supercomputing, which they're doing for NOAA, broader-based end-to-end enterprise network services, for example, like what they're working on for FAA, work on ground-based strategic deterrent, so on and so forth as well as a number of items for classified customers in FAA. They've got work for the Air Force. Again, the list could go on and on, if I name the programs, it wouldn't necessarily mean anything because they're all code names, but it is an increasing portfolio where they are getting pull-through overlap and commonality in these offerings. Doug Harned : Okay. And then also one more thing that gets into the details here on programs. If we go back to combat, Phebe, you talked about the trajectory here and flattening period, probably growth in 2023, where do you see that growth coming from? You mentioned some things, but if you had to say, this is why I'm confident in 2023 growth, would it be from some specific U.S. programs? Would it be ELS? Could it be other international? What are the things that get you most confident on that longer-term trajectory? Phebe Novakovic : So look, we've got -- I think, longer term, we're looking at additional Stryker configurations. If you think about the Stryker, it is a very versatile very versatile platform. And we've seen the Army in working with us, finding innovative and increasingly more fight critical variance of Stryker. So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical. And there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4%, 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our assumptions about growth in this portfolio. Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program, it's soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I will just say one thing about MPS. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation. And I believe we are the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's a discipline will do for you, disciplined product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future. Howard Rubel : Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We have time for one last question and I'll turn it back to you to do that and then give us final instructions. Operator : Absolutely, sir. Today's final question comes from Ron Epstein with BofA. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Sorry about that. I was on mute. So just maybe a bigger picture question. When we listen to the earnings calls of the group, every company tells us that they're well positioned relative to the defense budget. And I'm not saying you're not. But my question is this, if the budget flattens with the change in administration and the deficit and so on and so forth, where do you expect to see some pressure in the budget? How do you dodge that? I mean it seems like you are, but like where would you not want to be? Does that make sense? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let me tell you, I never speak to anybody else's portfolio, but a couple of observations. It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions, are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budget tiers get their night out. Those are almost always the last fall. So that's, I think, a longer perspective to look at. But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia in particular. And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threats that are key elements of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported. We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at ASCO, with the exception of the nuclear powered carriers, and nuclear submarines, all these navy's fleets needs gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiled program. So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear, even in a constrained budget. They will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that. And then in terms of the shorter cycle businesses, in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budget tier, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely. And I think, frankly, insulated, given the criticality of IT and then within -- to the war fight and DoD into other missions. And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas to think against submarines. So, I think it's a height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters criticality to the war fit matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rubel for final remarks. Howard Rubel : Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. And as a reminder, on our website, gd.com, you'll find the deck and our press release. And with that deck, you'll also find the data for the -- our outlook for 2021. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you, sir. And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million. Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million and net earnings are up $2 million. To be a little more granular, revenue on the Defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the Defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the Aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I'll have more to say about this A bit later. The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rated Aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and have 50 more operating earnings. So, it's a pure operations beat. I must confess that we were also beat our own expectations rather handsomely. This is in almost all respects a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year. So, let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason at color around cash, backlog, taxes, and deployment of cash. And then we'll answer your questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million, with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell side expectations. Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventories. Without the charge from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb. Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with the book-to-bill of 1.3 to one. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34 to one. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last two years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years. This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So, the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increase the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital. But this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond. During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains two provisions that affect our business. First, it extended the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who were prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs. So that will have an ongoing diluted impact on the segments margins. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Raviv : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Thanks for the opportunity to hear. Question on actually on GDIT. The staffing , you guys had talked about 7% growth this year. You did 5% of the first quarter, so definitely a good start. So, any kind of milestones to look upon there. And then just overall commentary on the environment. We've heard of some delays and slowness in awards. Some other contractors have been highlighting, some disruptions that impact the organic growth. So, any view as to how that's impacting your 2021 and how that could flow out over 2022, some of these new businesses -- using awards come through. Phebe Novakovic : So, as I noted, we submitted a very large number of proposals in the quarter, and we are waiting over $30 billion in customer\u2019s decisions on contracts. And COVID, obviously, had some impact on those -- that decision-making process. But we suspect that as -- we expect that as the government gets back to full operating cadence that we will begin to work through some of that backlog on the order decisions. Jonathan Raviv : And then as -- thank you, Phebe. As a brief follow-up, again, sticking to the technology and maybe also like key market. When you look at this huge -- almost backlog of things to be adjudicate, you mentioned that a lot of it is new business. Would you consider a lot of this new business to be takeaways from other contractors, or is this some that element of whites-pace almost with the government creating and doing more things that are contractor addressable? Phebe Novakovic : So, I think, it's a combination. I think, we're winning more than our fair share, number one. Number two, the government is combining a number of preexisting current workload in the larger contracts given that the scale and magnitude of the effort that's required again is a good thing for us to bid on those large contracts. And then, some of it is just pure program programming. So, I think that's pretty much how we see that market unfolding. Jonathan Raviv : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Seth. Seth Seifman : I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned some inventory right downs on G500, I was wondering if you could quantify that. Just so we could have a cleaner look at the Aerospace margin. Phebe Novakovic : Yeah. So, we're not in the habit of giving detailed product by product margin. We did have a mark-to-market on some of our test airplanes, on the 500 test airplanes, which is pretty much to be expected with test airplanes. But we see that as largely behind us. So, I noted that just to tell -- to give you awesome color that absent that we would have seen even better operating performance. Seth Seifman : Right. I guess maybe without quantifying it, is there -- is it possible to talk a little bit about the -- I guess the trajectory of margins at Aerospace, when we should expect through the year and sort of as we go into Q2? Phebe Novakovic : So, we expect, as I noted, deliveries to be lower in Q2, margins to be compressed in Q2, but increasing nicely then quarter-over-quarter, as we go through Q3 and into Q4. But recall, we admitted before that we see 2021 as our lower margin year for all the reasons that we noted, not the least of which is we took about 10 airplanes, largely as -- on our production last year largely as a result of the -- ended the 550 production and some mid-cabin. So, when the demand begins to increase or increasingly picks up and we ought to see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and hence delivery rate. So, that'll drive margin. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : By the way, when you think about margin, particularly out the impact of the entry into service of the 700. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. Good quarter, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Cai. Cai von Rumohr : So, could you give us some more on demand at Gulfstream? You basically said it's broadly based. But first, what are we looking at in terms of corporate demand, which we've heard is still weak and ultra high net worth, which we've heard is very strong. And any color on specific models. Like I think you said you had 70 orders for the G700, are those -- is that number moving up at a decent pace? Phebe Novakovic : indoor 22 :46: So, look, if you think about demand, as we see the lifting of the international travel restrictions and removal of quarantine restrictions and the increased confidence of obviously the U.S. economy, but also global economies, we expect to see demand continue to increase and should it, we see Gulfstream as being in very good stead. Cai von Rumohr : So, you mentioned demand getting better. And we know that pre-owned prices are continuing to come down and we have the weird situation where all of this happening, while international routes are not opening up. Given the strength in demand, if you wanted, or if the demand were there to sort of deliver more planes, how long would it take you to kind of uptick your production rate so that we can see those deliveries moving up? Phebe Novakovic : So, on average, it takes about six months lead time. But we're -- looking at just a few more production airplanes, as I noted in my remarks, and we'll continue to adjust and be sufficiently agile as we see demand continue to increase. So I liked how we balanced ourselves right now. Prudent, yet forward looking and we are pretty efficient when it comes to that to ramping up. But it does take the lead time of about two quarters. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Phebe, want to follow-up on some of your earlier comments around the margin in Gulfstream. So, over time we got used to this being a mid to high teens business. Is that still the right way to think about this business going forward, particularly when the 700 comes in? And do you expect the 700 to be margin accretive when it starts to deliver? Phebe Novakovic : So, the 700 will be margin accretive when we begin deliveries. We think about this on -- given our portfolio and our place in the firmament as a mid-teen margin business for the short-term. But as you can imagine, we'll continue to work margins. And as we've talked about many times before our margins at Gulfstream are a whole host -- driven by a whole host of issues, not the least of which is service mix, mix of airplanes. And when we were -- a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, which kind of solitary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog. So, there wasn't too much of wait for people. But also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 450, 500 -- the 450, 550 with 500 and 600. So that is largely behind us. And we -- as I said, expect to see some nice margin accretion as we go forward. David Strauss : Great. That's helpful. And do you think -- could you comment a little bit on the moving pieces of capital and what to expect there? Inventories come down a bit, advances, benefit of headwind. So, just -- how we should expect the different pieces within working capital to move from here? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Sure. You'll recall the major moving pieces that we've talked about, sort of outside the normal run rates for the business, in general, have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we have invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen, a little earlier than we thought was going to happen. And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020. You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So, that'll become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shifted into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond. The other piece is, obviously, the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years, that turned with the modification to that contract that Phebe discussed earlier into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year, and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in 2022, 2023, and a little bit more in 2024. So, when you think about the way those two pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60%-ish range moving toward an expectation of the 80% range. Last year, we outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid to high 90% range. The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems. So, once that normalizes, next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us the whole business at large being in the 100% to 100%-plus range, really with those two working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above a 100%. So, that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead. David Strauss : Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Ronald Epstein : Yeah. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, Ron. Ronald Epstein : How are you? Switching over to the ship business? How is the electric boat adjusting to both having the Virginia Class and the Columbia Class in -- everything that they got to do in terms of workforce, supply chain, so on and so forth, and how's that going? Phebe Novakovic : It's going very well, on both ramping up Virginia and equally importantly, more significantly Columbia. There's something important to remember when you think about Columbia. We started work on that program 14 years ago. And in that 14-year-period we have worked assiduously with the Navy to reduce all known potential risks that we could foresee in the ramp up of a very complex new program that -- and that included workforce hiring and training, supply chain readiness, facility readiness, construction prototyping, technology readiness, retiring potential known risks -- the potential risks in new high-end technologies and then the design maturity. That -- this boat entered into construction with a 83% design completion level and break contest to Virginia, which has been an exemplary program at 43%. So all of this prior planning and 14 years of detailed blocking and tackling at every conceivable level has mitigated an awful lot of risk and allowed us to -- for verbally hit the ground running on Columbia, and so far so good. I will know, it\u2019s a very complex program, so you can't declare victory on any ship building program right out of the bat, but we have taken unprecedented and historically unprecedented measures to retire all the known risks going forward. So that has really allowed us to execute coming right out of the gates very strongly. They've done a very good job. Ronald Epstein : Got it. Got it. Got it. And it seems like the focus on the Pacific's been good for the ship business. How's it been for Gulfstream? I mean, when you think about U.S., China relations, has that had an impact on Gulfstream demand in the region? Phebe Novakovic : Not that we can see. So, our demand in Asia has been quite steady and good. We've got nice, large install base, a lot of customer intimacy there. So, today we have not seen it, that particular impact. Ronald Epstein : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, Myles. Myles Walton : Heard your thoughts on M&A for a little bit, so I was hoping maybe we could go there. Obviously, you're getting to a point on your leverage, which is getting pretty attractive, building up plenty of firepower. What are you looking at in terms of landscape GDs, always historically been an acquisitive company. Is the appetite growing there? Phebe Novakovic : So, we have been through a significant investment period across many of our large lines of business and our focus here is on execution and primary focus. We will -- we always look for potential niche bolt-ons here and there. But we don't see anything on the horizon here of any significant opportunities that would entice us. Myles Walton : Okay. And Jason, what's the target ratios that we're aiming for? I know you said you'll refinance some of it, but maybe a little color there. Jason Aiken : Yeah. I think perhaps less of a target ratio then -- we're going to continue to prioritize our mid A rating. That's always going to be sort of where we seek to land long-term. And so, the key for us right now is we had -- as you're aware of sort of an outsize level of debt maturing this year versus if you look out over the next 10 to 20 years what our debt ladder maturity phasing looks like. And so, really what we're aiming to do is sort of bring that into more of a balanced picture of capital deployment that allows us to step down the debt over time in reasonable measures, as well as have considerable flexibility and firepower available for other deployment opportunities. Myles Walton : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey. Phebe, maybe a big picture question for you, because I know Howard always has us covered on the numbers. You've been at GD as the -- over almost a decade now and at the company for 20 years, how do you think about where GD goes over the next decade, whether from a portfolio focus or customer focus as the budget flat lines or where operating leverage comes from that? Phebe Novakovic : So, from a strategic perspective, we decided several years ago to invest in a number of our significant lines of business, where we believe that we could realize the best return on invested capital and really drive value. We have been in that period at Gulfstream, GDIT, primarily the Gulfstream, GDIT and the Marine Group. So the key now from my perspective is all about execution. And execution has been the hallmark of everything that we do here, and it is the undergirding of all financial performance. And it requires a discipline across -- it requires discipline across a series of elements and that are faster than all operations. But really, as I see the next several years, it's all about execution and wise deployment of capital to drive nice value creation. Ultimately, long-term value creation is based on good product. It's a perm execution wise investments and smart capital limit. So that's what I see us doing. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead with your question. Pete Skibitski : Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason and Howard. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Pete Skibitski : Phebe, I was wondering -- in Combat, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what international orders are out there for you, maybe both kind of sole source expectations as well as competitive opportunities. Phebe Novakovic : So, international consists of two items, primarily sales outside the United States from entities outside -- from our business units outside the United States, as well as FMS sales emanating from the United States. And unfortunately, for the state of humankind, the world has become an increasingly dangerous place. And so, we see the reflection of that concern in many of U.S. allies with increased demand for many of our products in Europe, Eastern Europe, a little bit in Asia, parts of the Middle East, and in the former Commonwealth nations and in the U.K. as well. So, we looked for nice, steady demand signals coming from outside the United States for our business units that are domiciled ex-U.S. And FMS, United States has had a long history of providing its allies with FMS opportunities. And we have a number of those in our comp opportunities and our Combat Systems again, selling through the U.S. government to key us allies positions in particularly dangerous. So, we see that nice cadence continuing in terms of our orders. Pete Skibitski : Okay. And U.S. wise, you expect programs that you're competing for this MPS and all MSP. Do you think they survive any budget tightness? Phebe Novakovic : So, new programs are always the most vulnerable. But with MPS, we were -- the only person -- they're only contracted to develop -- I think there were 12 prototypes. We delivered those last year. We liked our offering. We think it's what the army wants. But we are very attuned to army demands and how they see their site. And that's where -- intimacy with the army helps significantly. That plus -- so with all of them at MSP, that program got stretched considerably. So, we are taking it seriously and participating, but there's a long way to go before that comes to fruition. But recall another element and a key element of army modernization is upgrading with key -- with important and innovative new technologies, their existing platforms. And for us that means Stryker and Abrams, and both are undergoing major upgrade programs. So, all-in-all, we see the demand for our programs continuing to go strong. And there is nothing like -- going back to the earlier comments about execution. There's nothing like performing on schedule and on budget to amplify and provide a bit of an antidote to any potential cuts that come in the future. So, Combat is the army's major integrator of Combat Wheeled Systems and will remain such. So that ensures that our place in the firmament remains pretty strong. Pete Skibitski : Right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Arment : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, a question on the budgets, I guess just kind of following up on your comments there. Just -- we got the skinny budget from the new administration, and obviously we're to get some -- a lot more details soon. But how are you thinking about just the alignment with the new administration priorities when you think it look at GDs portfolio? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So, clearly, as I think -- perhaps it was Ron mentioned the demand for products that meet the pacific theater have -- has increased that puts our ship building business, particularly submarines in a very good stead. And you can see all of -- both the rhetoric of funding supporting increased submarine production. And we are executing on the current programs of record and working with the Navy to -- additional submarines can be executed in a relatively short-term. With respect to our Combat Systems Group, unfortunately, but regrettably the case, the hottest theater at the moment is Russia. And so whether we like it or not, that is the reality with which we were faced and this administration has been very quick to respond appropriately to the Russians. And so you see -- we believe that Combat System is highly aligned with that reality that we're now faced with in Europe. So, all-in-all, we liked our positioning with the new administration's priority. Remember, and particularly administration and this president has been an advocate of strong national security throughout his long and distinguished career. U.S. National Security strategy is driven by the threat of the perception of threat that has not changed. So, we will see some changes in relative priority among systems, but in all instances, we see ourselves very well aligned. Peter Arment : And just as a quick follow-up. Something that doesn't get talked a lot about, but you have a lot of CyOps  capabilities. Maybe you could just give us a little color on how you see the opportunities there. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So, if you mean from both cyber, cyber is embedded in all of our business and if you get to -- but I think you referred to CyOps. One would be -- it would be the height of fallen to discuss any of that. But let's just put it this way. We have always been on the leading edge of innovations with respect to cyber and electronic technologies that apply to the real world site in the moment. Peter Arment : Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question. Richard Safran : Phebe, Jason, Howard, good morning. How are you? Phebe Novakovic : Fine. Richard Safran : First question I had is, I was interested in the announcement and I think it was back in February where at IT you added Amazon cloud services to the milCloud 2.0. What I wanted to know is, how much does the addition of Amazon enhance your offering? Was this something that just improve the cost on the program, or is this something that maybe opens up new opportunities for expanding cloud service to the government? Just anything you can tell us regarding the size of the opportunity, or what this does, would be appreciated. Phebe Novakovic : So, not surprisingly, the U.S. Department of Defense is moving as all major institutions are increasingly to the cloud. And so, our cloud offerings are -- an incrementally important part of our offerings that we believe will ultimately drive increased adoption across our existing contracts and adoption of the technology suite that we offer. And frankly, an expansion of the market. So, cloud presents a significant opportunity, and we are well-positioned to execute on it. Richard Safran : Okay. Thanks for that. And then second -- and just to kind of a broad strategic question for you and your comments about execution. Over the past year or so, you've made a number of changes to adjust how you're operating, clearly for obvious reasons. I was just wondering, what are the more permanent changes and how you operate -- and that are going to persist long after COVID? I was just wondering if you discuss how these changes? How you're thinking about that impacting and improving margins. Phebe Novakovic : So, let me infer a little bit from the question you're asking. We hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that there may be systemic changes emanating from COVID that have to do with work-at-home and what that might mean for a commercial real estate footprint. We still believe it is too soon to declare any change structural. We do expect to see some -- the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work-from-home either in hybrid capacities, or in some cases more completely.  But I don't see that move as something that is dispositive and determinative of real performance and execution. I think what you saw -- going back to execution through COVID -- and frankly, this company's performance across its business units during COVID was really a manifestation of the discipline that we have in all of our operating -- and our operating performance and our operating leverage. The more disciplined a company is the better they were able to adapt to the vagaries and some of the really significant challenges that COVID provided both to the workforce and frankly, the costumers and the environment. So, I think that, to me, it underscored, amplified our operating excellence. And I suspect that that will continue -- then understanding of that will continue to permeate as we go forward. And we will continue to build on that. Operating excellence is never static. It has to get better and better and better. That's what continuous improvement is all about. And frankly, we have a longstanding discipline of around that. So, I don't think there'll be a structural change in our operating performance, but it's simply undergirds the importance of that discipline that focuses on performance. Richard Safran : Excellent color. Thanks. Howard Rubel : And Jamie, we will have time for just one last question, please. Operator : And our final question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks very much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on the Aerospace division. Clearly, a very strong first quarter here. But I was wondering if you had seen any demand pulled forwards into the first quarter from the second quarter. And then secondly, you talked this before. How is the lead time for aircraft looking at? Are we still looking at roughly 12 months between an order and a delivery? And also how has pricing fed in the first quarter? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So, think of that demand, less about pull forward, demand comes when it comes and you execute it as it arrives on your doorstep. So, what we saw with respect to demand is starting -- as I noted in mid February, we start -- and we saw a nice steady increase in demand across a broad specter of our customer base and the U.S. Our initial estimates show or indications are that that demand is carrying through into the second quarter. Pricing is holding up very well. As you all know, we are very disciplined about our pricing. It is precious once lost. You don\u2019t get it back. We\u2019ve had a hard slog. So, pricing has done very well. And as I noted earlier, it\u2019s about six months to ramp up additional production and I don\u2019t see that interim significantly changing anytime soon, given all of the elements that have to perform. So, I hope that answers your question. Robert Stallard : Yeah. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Howard Rubel : Operator, this now ends our call. Thank you very much everybody for your time. And I will be available to answer your questions, and I can be reached in my office. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we have reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million, earnings per share are up $0.43. To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million or 14.3%, and operating earnings in aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis points lower than anticipated coupled with a somewhat lower share count, this led to the earnings feed. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3% and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall margins are up 40 basis points. The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective; free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us solid start to the year and enabled us to raise our forecast for the full year which I will share with you at the end of these remarks. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international Combat Vehicle contract. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow as Phebe noted was $943 million or 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year, so the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment; I mentioned capital expenditures which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales, that's down from last year but our full year expectation remains in the range of 2.5% of sales. We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares; that brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity saving purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Jason. Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4% which is 10 basis point below what we previously forecast; this will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin; so total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin of around 14.6%. Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin, so annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but add 30 basis points of operating margin, so annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%, this rolls up to EPS around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : Absolutely, sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Hi, yes. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Peter. Peter Arment : Nice results. Phebe, maybe just to start with Combat and my follow-up will be related to that. Just -- maybe, could you just talk about, I think there is really strong performance that you're seeing, but also, we're seeing a lot of activity in the international market that -- for some of your key platforms. Just how you think about Combat growing in what is a domestically flatter budget environment but based on how you're doing in terms of a lot of your works ? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So domestically both of our large platform programs, and Stryker and Abrams are continuing to grow, particularly Stryker, as the army assigns new missions and capabilities to that platform. There are also, as you all know, a number of developmental programs that factor into our longer-term thinking. Externally, outside the United States, demand is increasing, primarily driven by Europe. And again, that is focused and centered on our Combat vehicles, both -- both of our wheeled vehicles, as well as our track vehicles, most specifically, the Abrams main battle tank. Peter Arment : And just as a follow-up. Just as you talked about, I guess, some of that activity , have you -- do you expect that the discussions around recent comments around Poland, will that would be closing this year potentially? Phebe Novakovic : So, you know, Poland's been a very dangerous neighborhood. And I think there is no stronger deterrent than the Abrams main battle tank. I think press reports have suggested that they want 250 tanks for working very closely with the U.S. government to ensure we meet whatever ultimately United States and Poland determine that they want. I think our initial estimate to close is probably good solid year plus out; but again, more to be -- more to come, and then we'll keep you informed as that program unfolds. Peter Arment : Appreciate it. Thanks a lot for the color. Operator : And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Seth. Seth Seifman : Hi. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned in the remarks, Phebe, about what needs to be done on the engine for the G700. And I wonder if you could tell us specifically what milestones we should be looking for? And what risks that the engine poses to the schedule for the program? Phebe Novakovic : So as I noted, we continue to make progress on both, the airplane and the engine development; but as I'm sure you know being a student of new engine development programs, they are always difficult to get through certification, and while there is no particular issue at the time, we still have a ways to go with respect to that certification process. But at the moment, we don't have any particular issues that would impact our overall estimation of timing. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then, just as a follow-up. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about the AJAX program; how that's going and that it doesn't really seem to be having too much of a negative impact on the segment's financial results but -- the way that it's playing into financial performance of Combat? Phebe Novakovic : So, our U.K. customer is constructively and actively engaged in this program, and we're working very closely with them on two issues that were identified during customer test; one is noise and one is vibration. And given our long decade-long history of Combat vehicles design and production, you know, interestingly enough, this is a transformational vehicle for the U.K. army, and with many transformational programs it has emerged during the testing process. So, we will then are dealing with both of those issues quite closely with our U.K. government customer. Seth Seifman : Hey, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Next is Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kristine Liwag : Hi, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, can you provide more color on the type of our profile at Gulfstream or the demands from corporate or individual of U.S. versus international? Phebe Novakovic : Sure. All in all we see a reasonable balance across the broad cross section of buyers. The U.S. had a particularly strong quarter, generating more of this quarter's orders, some of the new customers and a broadening of the market and importantly, our core Fortune 500 customers have re-engaged. So in all that the markets we are looking at the moment is robust. Kristine Liwag : Thanks. And my follow-up is on pricing. Since there doesn't seem to be too many used jets in inventory, are you getting more pricing power for new orders? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let's just say as a matter, of course, we never talk about pricing. So, I am not about to break my discipline, but let me let me give you a little context here. Gulfstream has always been extremely disciplined about its pricing and that long history of disciplined control around pricing will continue. Price is precious and once you on rely on your discipline around pricing, it's a long way back up the hill. Kristine Liwag : Great. Thank you, Phebe. Operator : And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please, go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, just a follow-up on that topic and the strength of the demand environment in the order intake at aerospace. At what point would you feel comfortable raising business jet production? Phebe Novakovic : Well, we're increasing our business jet Gulfstream production rates throughout the remainder of this year. We've got 71 deliveries to go and we will, as you well know, set production for next year, in the fall of this year and then report fully to you on those production levels in next year. Robert Stallard : Okay. And just a follow-up on the pricing issue. Are you seeing -- you might call maybe irrational -- on the new pricing front? Phebe Novakovic : Well, that's your word, not mine. Hey look, we tend not to -- first of all we don't compete on price most importantly and I never comment on other people's behavior. That's a wise injudicious  stance to adhere to. Robert Stallard : Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, good morning and thank you for the time, Phebe, Jason and Howard. Maybe, on mission. If we could just talk about what's going on there for a second. I appreciate the divestiture in the semiconductor chip issue, but it seems like it was flat year-over-year organically and then the book-to-bill is slightly below one. So, maybe Phebe, can you talk about what the drivers in that business are and what you're seeing? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think you need to look -- as you well noted, our divestiture of our SATCOM business. But I believe absent that and given the chip issue that we and others have had and that we are working assiduously to address, we have seen some growth and we anticipate some additional growth going forward. But it will be best measured. Jason Aiken : And I think to add on to Phebe's point, assuming that business can overcome some of the supply chain issues that they've seen, which at this point they're getting good signals, that they'll be able to do in the second half. We ought to see some modest organic growth out of that business for the full year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And then maybe just one on Combat, that was also a really good quarter there and the first half is up, I think, 7%. It implies a deceleration into the second half. What's may be falling off there? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think it's a only slightly in percentage terms. We think we had originally guided to an increase burst what  impetus behind growth in the first half will repeat in the second half and that's logic and vehicle production deliveries in both the United States and outside the United States. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes, Phebe. Could you commented on what services did in the quarter? I imagine it was up and what you expect for the rest of the year? Phebe Novakovic : You mean in aerospace services? George Shapiro : Yes in Gulfstream. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, well, our services include both jet aviation services as well as Gulfstream. So, we saw some nice order, nice recovery in the United States, but here in Middle East  and Asia recovering a little more slowly. So, I think we had anticipated about $0.5 billion increase in revenue. I think that is a bridge too far in the moment and I think we're looking more along the lines of... Jason Aiken : Call it $375-ish million for the year at this point. Phebe Novakovic : So, not tremendously off our original estimate, but as I said, it's the international recovery. That's been just a touch slower than we anticipated, but the U.S. has been very, very strong. Jason? Jason Aiken : And George, on to that point, I think it's driven a nice rebound this year, I think to the tune of around 25% growth over last year and importantly, I think that some people are watching the levels we've seen through the first half of this year or within, call it 95-ish percent of where we were at this time in 2019. So, I think that's a good initial indication of the strength of the recovery in that business here in 2021. George Shapiro : Okay. I'll stick with my one. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, George. Operator : And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please, go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Doug Harned : I wanted to go back to Gulfstream because when you talk about the demand where it's obviously very good, you talked a little bit about where they're coming from. But can you give us a sense of the psychology of your customers? By that I mean, are you seeing these orders come in really as kind of pent up demand that's been slowed recently? Or are you seeing people actually think about the use of business jets differently coming out of ? Phebe Novakovic : So, we have no evidence that there has been any fundamental shift in thinking about the use of business aviation, I think that it would be way, way, too premature to get real clarity about that. You're kind of getting a question that we've received a number of times and that goes to kind of, is there a structural change as a result of this pandemic in business aviation? And if you think critically about change, what we know is that structural change is almost never apparent prospectively. It almost always is apparent retrospectively. And so, I believe that it is premature to assume any pronouncements about structural change. Now that said, we've seen our customers are the same kinds of customers that we've had historically back in -- I think there was some slowing obviously. There was some slowing of demand last year and a number of our customers, particularly in the Fortune 500 are on their aircraft replacement cycle. That remains unchanged. We did see some new entrants into the market as some industries have expanded in the COVID environment, creating opportunities for those companies. But yes, I think psychology is an interesting word, but I think I've gotten to the essence of your question. Doug Harned : And a little bit related to that, you described the unit book-to-bill is higher than the revenue book-to-bill. Have you seeing a mixed shift towards a smaller aircraft and what do you see driving that difference in unit versus revenue book-to-bill right now? Phebe Novakovic : Well, we have not seen a movement particularly into the smaller jets. I think the 280 was maybe about less than that 20% of the order book and really, it's demand for both the in-service airplanes, the 500, 600, 650 and of course in 700. So, really a strong demand pull across all of our airplanes. I don't think there's anything in particular discern from that. These are our regular customers back buying to replace the airplanes in the missions that they need and they have and the airplanes that they buy, then with each one of those missions since the way we think about it. Doug Harned : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please, go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. David Strauss : Phebe, on Gulfstream production, just to kind of level set us, you talked about it coming down  in COVID. Are you taking Gulfstream -- I guess just looking at holistically on the large cabin side and adjusting for the G550. Are you taking large-cabin production back to where we were prior to all this or above that? Phebe Novakovic : Follow-up, we are increasing on a reasonable basis. Our production of all of our existing now airplanes and we are not back at the 2019 production levels, but to-go basis we're looking at second half orders of 71 and so that in it of itself suggests that we've got solid production I will tell you and that production plan contemplates increased production in each and every one of our in-service large-cabin fleet. David Strauss : Okay, all right. And Jason, quick follow-up. Just given the strength of Gulfstream order activity and advances you're seeing there, could you be looking at closer to kind of 100% or maybe even a little bit above that free cash flow conversion this year? Jason Aiken : Yes, I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way to think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half and getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly at times most, if not all, of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half is not even most in the fourth quarter. So, that's not anything I would put together by design and I'm really encouraged by the shift in that slope that we've seen this year. So, it does give us, I think even reinforced confidence to getting to that 95% to 100% range. I think if you think about that range as a percentage of net income and combine that with Phebe's guidance on increasing net income, you can imply increasing free cash flow to support that number. And frankly, if I'm going to lean a little forward, I think it could possibly put us towards the top into that range of the 95% to 100% range. I don't know, but I'd want to get out above 100% this year. I think we still look to next year and beyond to be nicely above 100%, but bottom line, I think this reinforces improvement in overall free cash flow and maybe pushes us up towards the higher end of that 95% to 100% range. David Strauss : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please, go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the 12.4% margins in aerospace and obviously in the first half, you're slightly under that, but the first quarter included a charge in the second quarter, I'm sure had production inefficiencies because of the manufacturing being close point. So I'm just curious, it would look like there is more upside in the second half, barring some pickup in in R&D or other expenses. Is that an area of conservatism that we should be ? Phebe Novakovic : So, when we think about the second half margins, they will be better than our first half margins -- our first half margins were at low point. But we will see some negative impact from two factors. One is the absence of the 550  deliveries as that airplane is now out of service and a higher R&D as we move toward G700 certification. Myles Walton : Okay, all right. And then, maybe just give us some color if you can, if you want to on the first availability of delivery slots, particularly on the 500, 600 at this point? Phebe Novakovic : We got out of the practice of doing that because it became a lot less meaningless with new airplane deliveries -- with new airplanes. So, we're not going to, I think, reinstitute that. Myles Walton : You can't go back to there? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, go back to there, but I think if you think about the environment that we're looking at now and we think we've been very clear and consistent about this -- starting really, it was in mid-February, we saw an increase in demand and it was consistent and steady throughout that first quarter that led to the order quarter you saw this quarter and second quarter. And then, as we look at both the pipeline and the market, at the moment, it is robust. So, we're seeing a return as I said, of our Fortune 500 customers, as well as new entrants and North America is quite strong. So all in all, I think we're looking at about a pretty good market. Myles Walton : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Matt Akers, Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. Matt Akers : Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. A couple on the IT business. I guess, anything in particularly you can point to that kind of drove the strength this quarter either by customer or product? And then I think you said you were seeing some delayed awards. Is that the comment, sort of the protest that you mentioned or is that kind of a broader statement about the market? Anything you can elaborate on there. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, sure. So, our growth in the quarter with shield across many of our 7,000 contracts, but notably proportionately a bit more from our new contract awards. So, contract awards for new work, I think which is significant, we have seen a delay in contract awards from two fundamental factors. One, there has been an increase and elongation in the customer decision cycle; and two, we've seen an increase propensity of many in the IT industry to protest repeatedly. Early and often seems to be the mantra. So, both of those have increased our expectations for when we can see that growth coming, but I think I mentioned that we've got about $34 billion already in customer hands awaiting some sort of decision and we've got about $20 billion in the pipeline. So, all of that drives growth. It's just given this elongated cycle and given this increased propensity to protest, it's going to make the recognition of that revenue a little bit lumpier. Matt Akers : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, just maybe one on shipbuilding. A little bit strategic, but one of your peers in shipbuilding stated that the future of the Navy is going to be Platform Plus, where shipbuilding platforms will be tailored around capabilities and technologies that are key differentiators. Would you agree with this? I'm not sure it applies to submarines as much surface ships, but would you agree with this and would GD need to make any additional investments either organically or inorganically to position yourself from this? Phebe Novakovic : Platform Plus. I'm not sure I can give you any real insightful color around that. I will tell you how we see our ships. Let's talk about the surface combatants first in the DDG . That is an extraordinarily versatile ship that has over the years had multiple instantiation of improvements and remains a very, very agile ship in terms of its ability to upgrade. So, we're already on the block. Our fight free upgrade which gave an additional capability, I suspect that that ship and others like it can be the type of platform that evolves over time to address different kinds of missions. I think that that's pretty much regular order. I don't know that that's a systemic change in the way the Navy has ever looked at it's combatant fleet. With respect to our auxiliary ships, I think that those tend to be , and I'm thinking the oilers, EPS, those tend to be purpose-built ships for a particular mission. And then submarines, submarines remain a pivotal competitive advantage for the United States and what we have historically focused on and will continue to focus on is integrating any new technologies or capabilities up that's submarine. I think it's very important when you're in a complex business like shipbuilding and particularly submarine design and construction, that you focus on the business of designing and building those ship and ensuring that you can successfully integrate any new capabilities that your customer wants, and we have a long history of that and I suspect us to continue that for some time to come. Howard Rubel : Raquel , we'll just take one more call, please. Operator : Yes, sir. And our final question today will come from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please, go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So GDIT, when do you expect those two protests to be kind of adjudicated? And secondly, you have an above-average exposure to fed civil, which where the funding is strong, Q3 normally is the strongest booking quarter for the sector's book-to-bill quarter. So, give us some color on what we should expect this quarter to the extent? Phebe Novakovic : So, Cai, you got a glass to judge . We have very little insight, like none into the timing of protest resolution. That really is up to the reviewing authority. With respective to the federal civilian, I think we've been with many of those customers for 30 years and we have a lot of customer intimacy across several many key federal civilian agencies. And I would imagine that as they receive more funding and the ubiquitousness of IT infrastructure to all of their missions, I would see that is some additional upside and potential for us. When that comes, again, we'll depend on whole series of issues around timing. But you can rest assure that in that pipeline on a going forward basis that we're looking at, we've got some good work in there. Cai von Rumohr : Great. And so a follow-up on the AJAX; you mentioned you're . Phebe Novakovic : So far we've had -- I think we had two issues . Cai von Rumohr : Okay, two issues. Good point. But I believe it's a fixed price contract and there has been call there that basically you pay for all the state-issue expenses. Do you see that jeopardizing profitability on the contract? Phebe Novakovic : We have been able to make any changes here before in a very cost-effective and time-efficient manner to meet the needs of our customers for the testing program. But I do not see at the moment any impact on our EACs, or frankly on our ability to produce this vehicle efficiently. The kinds of changes we're likely to see that we anticipate, typically are cut into the production line. So, I don't see a whole lot of motivations  from a cost or schedule impact from the changes that we can envision resulting from this -- from the resolution that we come to our customer with on these particular issues. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific, thanks so much. Howard Rubel : Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and of course, the highlights presentation, which includes our revised guidance. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you, Raquel. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you as well.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.  We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, our earnings press release and our filings with the SEC, all of these which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.  With that completed, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.  Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1%, and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.  On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%. We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion. That is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.  So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.  We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.  With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered. On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part, by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulfstream service centers.  The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, this quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.  As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.  From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum. The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.  As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We had planned for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.  The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems. Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S., with a brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half a brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.  In the near term, we are stable internationally but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.  Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.  Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.  We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.  Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%. Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1 :1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1 :1 and somewhat less in Mission Systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.  From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unclassified spending in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model. So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.  Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year. Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.  We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.  With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.  The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter, with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1 :1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion. That's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Myles Walton : Phebe, I wonder, could you talk a bit about the transition potential margin impact of the new generation of the 400 and the 800 coming online? It seems like the 800 is a pretty advantageous move for the 650 engine with the 700 engines. And you usually would expect some level of reset on margins, but I'm curious if that reset will be materially lighter than we'd normally expect with the new entry into service. Phebe Novakovic : So we get a fair number of questions on this, so I think it's worthwhile walking through each element here. And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700. The 800 replaces the 650, and the 400 comes later. Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.  And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift, remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck. The G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings and the same basic fuselage. The G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.  Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like Jason to talk a little bit more, and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting. Jason Aiken : Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.  Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development, and so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supplier offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts. And those come in lumps and chunks, so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.  But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the -- frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time. Phebe Novakovic : So what does all that mean if you step back? So margins this year are at their low point in aerospace. Next year margins will improve, and '23 margins will improve. Earnings were better in '21 than they were last year. They're going to be better in '22 and '23. And by the way, when we give you guidance on the next call, we're going to give you some color and some insight into both of those years to help explain and amplify again what we're looking at, at Gulfstream. So I hope that helps answer your question, Myles. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question, which will be coming from David Strauss. David Strauss : Phebe, I wanted to ask you, you highlighted that the Gulfstream backlog is the highest it's been in about 6 years. I think if I just take kind of the aircraft revenue, you've got something like 2.5 years in backlog based on today. So how -- and at the same time, you also comment on supply chain challenges. So how do you balance all that as you think about where production rates go at Gulfstream? Phebe Novakovic : So the increased demand supports increased production. We'll get into all of that specificity on the next call. But as I noted, after we reduced production last year in response to COVID, supply chain challenges that were in large part driven by COVID and COVID demand, the supply chain needs to gear back up. So there's a little bit of a headwind. But that's why I wanted to give you the color around the margin and earnings performance. David Strauss : Okay. But all that being said, we should see higher production in '22 and '23? Phebe Novakovic : We're anticipating that to drive a higher revenue. So as I said in my remarks, this is a rich problem to have. I wanted to be as transparent with you as possible to tell you, hey, look, we've got this. There's a nice strong backlog. We've got very good demand, a continuing demand. But as we ramp up, and we will be ramping up, there are some challenges. We can manage those challenges and manage through them, but I thought it was important that you guys understand that. Operator : We're now going to move over to Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I was wondering if you could elaborate on these challenges. You obviously face some chip issues in Mission Systems, but it seems you're also conscious of some potential headwinds in the aerospace division that ramps up. And one of your peers also talked about broader supply chain challenges in its Defense business. I was wondering if you could comment on this topic generally and what you could be seeing in the future. Phebe Novakovic : So I tried to give you some measured look at the Aerospace issues. But on supply chain, the chip shortage impacted Mission Systems. I would note how -- and we do expect that to go into next year somewhat. I would note, however, even since the close of the quarter, they have begun to significantly mitigate some of those chip impacts. But across the portfolio of our defense businesses, we are not seeing significant or even material supply chain challenges. So we've been able to manage through that pretty well. So for us, and I can only speak for us, that hasn't been a significant issue other than its impact at technologies and driven by Mission Systems. Robert Stallard : Yes. And in aerospace, the challenge is there. Is that just a lead time issue with suppliers? Or is it specific parts that you're finding particularly tight? Phebe Novakovic : It's primarily a lead time. The fact that we pulled down last year adds a little bit of headwind to the increase in production that we see on a going-forward basis. But I don't see any particular problems at the moment impacting that. This is really just a timing issue and getting folks back up to speed. Operator : We're now going to move over to Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : Yes. So Phebe, could you give us some color on demand at Gulfstream, specifically high net worth versus corporate versus fractional? And most importantly, are you seeing any opportunity for improved pricing in this sector? Phebe Novakovic : Let me answer those in the inverse order. We have seen some upward pressure on pricing, and then let me unpack your demand. So look, our own view of our increased demand is a combination of factors. One, the very attractive product mix, a strong economy, the return of the Fortune 1000, increase high net worth individuals. And in fact, COVID did create in pockets some wealth creation and the pent-up demand that's built up during the pandemic. The demand is -- and I think importantly is spread evenly pretty much across our product line. And there's nothing unusual to report on customer mix or geographic distribution other than the North America was quite, quite strong. Operator : And we're now going to move to Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : Just maybe changing gears a little bit. I think everybody is going to focus on bizjet, so I'm going to maybe not do that. A while back, there was some discussion... Phebe Novakovic : Oh my, how innovative. Ronald Epstein : Imagine that, right? There were some discussion in the press around the Polish defense ministry purchasing some Abrams tanks and 1 Abrams. I think maybe 250 of them, if I remember right. Where does that stand? And if you can give some color on that and maybe some of the other international business going on in the Land Systems business. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we're working very closely with our customer as well as the Department of Defense to support a potential order of 250 tanks out of Poland. If we -- and frankly, this is a powerful system for the polls to have given their geographic location and their historical experience, particularly with folks stream and West. So if we think through again the FMS process, and this is an FMS sale, we're looking at somewhere between maybe in the 2-year period. But just to give you a little bit of additional color we see increased demand signals coming out of Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and, of course, the Middle East. The world hasn't gotten any safer. Operator : We'll now move over to our next question from Richard Safran of Seaport Research Partners. Richard Safran : Phebe, Jason, Howard, with such great cash flow performance, I wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about capital deployment, invest in the business, dividends, repurchases, commercial paper. Now, Jason, I heard your remarks about retiring commercial paper. But as we look ahead, are you thinking about maintaining your current strategy? Or are you considering any changes? I think in the past, you've stated you invest in the business depending on need and that dividend should be repeatable. But I was just curious if there's any update here on how you're thinking about it. Phebe Novakovic : So let me give you the strategic framework, and then Jason can fill in any specifics. But essentially, our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged. We invest opportunistically in small acquisitions or in investments to grow the business where we can get a good capital return, return on our capital. Dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. This has been our strategy from the day 1 and the advent of this management team. Jason? Jason Aiken : Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to your point on the commercial paper repayment and future priorities around debt is that commercial paper will mature here in the fourth quarter. We've got more than sufficient cash on hand, so we'll just repay that in normal course as it comes due. The next debt maturity is in late next year. I think it's around $1 billion that will come due. So no real imminent issues there, so we can focus on the priorities Phebe mentioned. And then as those elements of the debt ladder do mature, we'll pay those down in due course up to  a point until we get to a comfortable place that we think long term continues to support our target mid-A credit rating for the company. Operator : We'll now be taking our next question from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Phebe, when you think about the certification timeline for the 700 and the 800, I guess, is there anything you'd point out to as a long pole in the tent? And thinking specifically about the engine certification, which you mentioned today, and then also the changes in ODA that Steve Dickson outlined last week testifying before Congress. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So our estimate at the moment still remains late next year for the 700, with the 800 to follow 6 to 9 months later. For those of you who have followed engine certification for years and decades, some of you, you'll know that they are always challenging. This engine is performing extremely well in terms of its capability in either meeting or outperforming its design specification. We've got a lot of test growth on a going-forward basis to get through. So we don't see any particular issues at the moment, but we are mindful that these are always complex and challenging processes to work through. And we've adapted to changes in the -- in our regulators in the FAA's game book before. And at the moment, we don't see any reason to adjust our estimates. But if we do, we'll let you know. Seth Seifman : Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Jason. If you could update us on where you expect to be on working capital at the end of this year and then kind of maybe without specific guidance, just what the opportunity buckets are in working capital for '22. Jason Aiken : Sure. I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter. Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems. You've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems. And that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.  The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023. So those are really the big movers there and should give you a sense of where we ought to see the working capital moving over the next 2, 3 years. Operator : Our next question will be from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Phebe and Howard and Jason. Phebe, how do you anticipate the vaccine executive order will affect labor and production? And also, do you have a sense of the percentage of GD employees that are currently vaccinated? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So before I get into the mandate, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate again our acknowledgment of our workforce. I think it's important to remember that we were declared a critical national infrastructure business early in the onset of the pandemic. And as a result of that, our workers stayed on the factory floor in the shipyards and in places where they were needed, frankly, throughout the pandemic. They stood their watch and, from my perspective with courage and fortitude, to produce the goods and services that are necessary for our national security. I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed. Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate, and many others are set to implement accordingly. And because of our customer, operational and geographic diversity of many of our businesses, we are working with our customers as contract modifications are received that could trigger an implementation. So we keep a pretty running tally. We're at, we believe, in some form of either full or partial vaccination in the 75% range or so. And then yes, so we understand the mandate. Kristine Liwag : And then maybe if I could add one on supply chain and aerospace. We're seeing that some of the suppliers also have to comply with the mandate. How are you mitigating potential supply chain issues in aerospace if you're not able to get parts? And how do you think about that with regards to your production rate plans for Gulfstream? Phebe Novakovic : Well, frankly, to the extent that there is an impact in the supply chain of this mandate, it will affect a lot of lines of business throughout the defense aerospace world. So I don't see a particular challenge at Gulfstream or in the moment at any of our other large lines of business. But we will certainly be mindful and deal with any workflow perturbations should they emerge.  Look, we have a history of dealing with challenges methodically, systematically and thoroughly. So you'd expect us to approach that operating discipline and apply that operating discipline to any emerging issues that may or may not arise. Operator : We'll now move to our next question from Peter Arment of Baird. Peter Arment : Phebe, maybe just to ask on the Technologies segment, just given the strong operating performance there. Is there any -- just a clarification, is there any onetimers in the 10.5% that you had this quarter? Phebe Novakovic : No. Peter Arment : And just if not, do you view this segment being able to sustain its kind of 10% or a double-digit margin going forward or just any color around that? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Double-digit margin going forward. Okay? Peter Arment : Yes. No, I just -- any -- are you seeing any changes there or your ability to kind of manage that in terms of I know it's a very price competitive environment. Phebe Novakovic : No. I mean not at the moment. We've been pretty consistent in our margin performance across this entity. So I don't see any systemic change that should impact that. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : I wonder if you could talk about for the G400, 800, just kind of early feedback. And how much, I guess, of the demand you're seeing there, sort of customers that are sort of incremental that wouldn't have bought some of your other platforms versus potentially kind of cannibalizing some of the other aircraft? Phebe Novakovic : We have no instances of cannibalization to date. The 800 is ultimately a replacement for the 650. About 650 demand remains pretty steady. And the customer base is pretty much our typical customer base. There may be incremental adds here and there, but I would argue that we see that in both the 700 and 800 and frankly, the rest of that portfolio to the extent that there are incremental here and there. And this tend to be high net worth individuals or some new Fortune 1000 or 500 companies. But I think there's nothing particularly notable here in terms of being exceptional outside the norm. Other than there's a lot of good interest here. We've taken a good number of orders. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : Phebe, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the fiscal '22 defense budget. There seems to be a lot of tailwind to the President's request in Congress. And I'm wondering if you could share with us if you see some of the support, incremental support, occurring to GD programs and maybe you'd wager odds if that budget could be signed into law by the end of this calendar year or not. Phebe Novakovic : So I think you know as much as I do, given the fulsome and in-depth reporting on congressional budget processes about the likelihood of signing, so I'm not going to go speculate on hypothetical timing. But I think, importantly, all of our major and frankly all of our programs were well supported, and some are beneficiaries of  increased spending on the part of the Congress. So all in all, we had no particular surprises, by the way, up or down. So we were quite comfortable on how this budget is being played out. Operator : Our next question will be coming from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Phebe, the -- in the business jet market at large, the end market and investors keep debating the sustainability of this recent uptick in demand and some people feel like it's... Phebe Novakovic : I haven't heard a lot of that. Noah Poponak : Yes. Exactly. Well, you've made, I guess, the pragmatic decision to kind of not wait in there. And I guess, I just wonder if you've had enough time or you speak to so many customers, if you've heard enough from real deal new customers to perhaps have more of a view on the sustainability of what we're seeing. Phebe Novakovic : Well, I wouldn't be taken little about this. I think that -- and nor should anybody. I think the demand that we're seeing is, I tried to reiterate before, is across our existing customer base. The Fortune 1000 is back in force. There are, as I noted, new entrants into that market as some companies have increased their profitability over the last 2 years. And there are additional high net worth individuals who have entered into the market. So I think that the data -- and I can only speak for Gulfstream. The data would suggest that given our attractive product mix as strong, as I noted earlier, strong economy and the fact that our customers are back and broad-based demand, I'm not worried at the moment about sustainability. These are -- Gulfstream is in and business jet market is in a cyclical market, driven in part no small measure by the economy. But we have been the most resilient in terms of demand through most economic cycles. So again, I think we are [ very resilient ] and we've got a good pipeline going forward. Noah Poponak : That's helpful. Do you have a sense, even if directionally, how many of your customers in the last 18 months are truly brand new? Phebe Novakovic : We're not going to parse it, but it's pretty -- we've gotten a fair number of new folks, but also our regular and historic customers. They're back on some new customers from market share increases. So as far as I'm concerned, we had very, very good demand, and the pipeline remains robust. As that was our final question, I would like to hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached (703) 876-3117. That will now end our call. Operator : This concludes the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you, all, for joining, and have a great rest of your day.",

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page on our Web site, investorrelations.gd.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, and thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion, net earnings of $952 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.39. The sales in most respect consistent with our previous guidance sell-side consensus. The results in comparison with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. I'll go through some of that detail quite briefly, as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated, it would be, the final quarter is our strongest quarter of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings, operating margin, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the prior quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvements. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue was up $724 million, operating earnings were up $106 million, and earnings per share up $0.32. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good operating performance. For the full year, we had revenue of $38.5 billion, up 1.4% from 2020; net earnings of $3.26 billion, up 2.8% and earnings per fully diluted share of $11.55, modestly better than consensus and up $0.55 over 2020. We ended the year with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value of $127.5 billion. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in aerospace backlog to $16.3 billion. I'll have more to say about that when we get to the business segment comments. The total company book-to-bill is one-to-one for the quarter and the year, led by the powerful order performance of Gulfstream. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year is very strong. The conversion rates of the quarter is 136% of net income and 104% for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject and backlog in his remarks. Now let me turn to reviewing the quarter and paying some attention to quarter-over-quarter and sequential comparisons as well as full year in the context of each group and provide colors appropriately. So, first Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.6 billion is up 5.1% over the year ago quarter on the delivery of 39 aircraft, 35 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectation by one aircraft, which has flipped  into 2022. For the full year revenue of $8.1 4 billion is up modestly from the prior year even though we delivered 119 aircraft, 8 fewer aircraft than we did in 2020. The increase was driven by higher service revenue at Gulfstream and a nice increase in revenue at Jet Aviation. Fourth quarter Aerospace earnings of $354 million are down $47 million from year ago quarter, even though revenue was $125 million higher, resulting in a 270 basis point reduction in operating margin. The major source of the variance is a $50 million increase in net R&D costs driven by the certification on the G700 and G800 and accelerated work on the G400. The year ago quarter was also helped by a significant launch assistant payment that was an offset to gross R&D. Nevertheless, Aerospace operating earnings and margins are better-than-anticipated by consensus. The same can be said for the full year results. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved throughout the year and that was true with respect to both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. At midyear last year, we told you we expect revenue of about $8.2 billion; operating margin around 12.4% with earnings of $1.01 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.14 billion; operating earnings of $1.03 billion and a 12.7% operating margin. In sum, we were slightly better on earnings and margin, but very close to our forecast on revenue.  the most important story in the quarter for Aerospace and frankly for the company was the extraordinary order activity of Gulfstream. Last quarter, I told you that orders in the third quarter boarded on the spectacular. This quarter, they were significantly better. Order activity in the quarter was beyond anything we had seen since 2008 with the introduction of the G650. Demand that turned very good in mid-February and continued through the second and third quarters was red hot in fourth quarter. Let me give you the particulars. The Aerospace group in dollar denominated orders had a book-to-bill of 1.7 to 1. Gulfstream alone was 1.8 to 1 and in unit terms, it was over 2x. Remember that these multiples are off of an increased denominator with 39 deliveries. This translates into a very significant backlog growth. Aerospace added $1.6 billion to backlog in the quarter and $4.7 billion for the year. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains robust and sales activity is brisk. The buildup in backlog and the pace of current demand leaves us with a rich problem, but a problem nonetheless. How do we satisfy the demand manifest in our current backlog supplemented by continuing brisk activity having previously turned down production? Can the supply chain support us? Are we ready? Well, the answer is we will increase production in 2022, but not to where it needs to be. Remember also that some of our increased production in '22 will be in building G700s, and G800s that will not deliver in '22, a prebuild, if you will. As it turns out, the long pull in the 10 is manufacturing wings, which we do ourselves. You may recall that we previously vertically integrated wing supply because of  in the supply chain. So, what do we need to do? We need to expand our new modern wing facility and acquire another set of tools and fixtures. All of this is underway and will be in place to satisfy our needs for '23 and beyond. This leads to the question of what are the implications of this for 2022 guidance. I'll address '22 guidance a little later. Further, given the robust and enduring backlog of Gulfstream, we also feel comfortable with giving you a look at what is anticipated for '23 and '24 as well. Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 2,200 flight test hours. We have completed over 65% of all required testing. Next Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.89 billion is up 3.7% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $281 million are off $28 million on a 90 basis point decrease in operating margin. Let me point out, however, that a 14.9% margin in the quarter is highly respectable. For the full year, revenue of $7.35 billion is up $128 million, a 1.8% increase after strong growth in 2019 and moderate growth in 2020. Operating earnings for the year of $1.07 billion are up $26 million, a 2.5% increase. By the way, this performance is in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe that Combat volume will soften somewhat in the increasingly constrained budget environment faced by the U.S Army. While our platform programs remain critical to the Army War fight, we may see some contraction in part offset by international growth in Abrams, and real combat vehicles. We will continue to drive margins as we always have. Remember that Combat Systems has had very good margins and much more constrained revenue environments. In short, this group has had a positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, has good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was up less than 1% over the year ago quarter. However, revenue is up 8.8% sequentially and 5.5% for the full year. Similarly, operating earnings are down somewhat in the quarter, but up sequentially and for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. In our initial guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $10.3 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $855 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings and spot on the predicted operating margin. Our shipyards have continued to perform well overcoming most of the challenges that COVID lay in our path. First, continuing to operate without ceasing throughout COVID, and more recently managing labor shortages, part shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing commodity prices. Importantly, on the latter point, our long-term shipbuilding contracts provide protection from material escalation. I'm happy to report that we are working very well with the Bath unions and workforce and together we have worked put the past behind us and concentrate on improving schedule and performance. As a result, Bath has begun to see improvement on both scores. In response to significant increased demand from our needy customer that you'll see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at EB to prepare for Virginia Block V, and the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer, as they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog. Finally, the Technologies group which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems. Just to remind you, this is the group in the defense segment that had have the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficulty accessing customer locations whose employees also have been working remotely. It is also where we have the most impact from this short supply of chips and other key components that mission systems. With that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the Group and the specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $2.98 billion, up 7.9% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings, however, of $334 million are up only 5.1% on a 30 basis point improvement margin. The operating margin of 11.2% is the strongest since the formation of this group. Revenue for the full year of $12.46 billion is up 1.5%, but earnings are up $64 million, or 5.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. All considered the group performance showed good strength and earnings are in line with guidance from us. Revenue came in at $543 million below our guidance driven by mission system challenges that we have discussed last quarter, offset in part by 2.2% growth the GDIT. Margins at both companies were very good enabling us to meet our earnings forecast. So very good operating leverage in a very challenging environment. The group enjoyed a nice order quarter with significant wins and a book-to-bill of 1 to 1, a little bit stronger GDIT and a little bit lower at Mission Systems. Mission Systems did a very good job overcoming many of their supply chain challenges, was working hard to satisfy the pent-up demand that was driven by a significant backup of work orders in some customers sites and by supply chain shortages. Turning to IT. Our Fed and Civilian division had a particularly strong year in '21 and help drive a 60 basis point improvement in margin over 2020. And as been the case since the acquisition, GDIT's cash performance was outstanding. Well in excess of 100% of their imputed net income GDIT's backlog at the end of 2021 was $8.7 billion, 4% higher than yearend '2020. Book-to-bill was 1.1 to 1 on sales growth at 2.2%. This is notable in light of the dollar value of GDIT wins and snared and protests that went from about $800 million at the end of 2020 to a whopping $6 billion at the end of '21. While we expect these protests will resolve in our favor, protest resolution timing is outside our control. As we look into '22, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities to pursue as customers focus on digital modernization, and over $32 billion of bids, largely all new work awaiting customer decisions. So, all in all, we expect a good year for the business. Let me turn the call over now to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason? Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter or 136% of net income with strong cash performance across all four segments. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $3.4 billion, a cash conversion rate of 104%. That was nicely ahead of our anticipated 95% to 100% of net income, and again reflective of solid performance across the company, but in particular, the strong order activity at Gulfstream. That strong performance enabled us to continue our balanced and robust capital deployment activities. To that point, capital expenditures were $385 million in the quarter or 3.7% of sales. That's up more than 10% from the prior year, and brings us to $887 million for the full year. Of course, Marine Systems continues to drive the elevated CapEx with facilities investments in support of the unprecedented growth the Group is experiencing now and for the next decade plus. The full year total for capital investments at 2.3% of sales is slightly below our original expectation of 2.5%. That's due strictly to the timing of the phasing of those projects. While our investments to support the Navy's submarine programs have peaked, we expect capital expenditures to remain somewhat elevated at about 2.5% of sales in 2022, slightly higher than 2021, before returning as we forecast for some time to our more typical 2% range in 2023 and beyond. We also paid $332 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.3 billion, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 10 million shares for the year for $1.8 billion at just under $179 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $135 million in 2021 and we expect that to decrease to approximately $40 million in 2022 as a result of the ARPA funding release. As we've discussed for some time, we expect to continue to generate cash in the 100% plus conversion range in 2022 and beyond. Our outlook assumes the unfavorable impact of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures for tax purposes beginning in 2022, as called for under current law. There's proposed legislation to delay the effective date of this requirement, but we'll have to wait and see if it's approved by Congress and signed into law. Assuming there is a deferral of the R&D capitalization provision, we would expect our free cash flow to be in the 110% conversion range. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with a net debt position of $9.9 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year and the first time we've ended the year with net debt below $10 billion since 2018. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $93 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $424 million. That compares to $120 million and 477 million in the respective 2020 periods. The year-over-year reduction in interest expense is due to the retirement of $1.5 billion of long-term debt back in May. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $1 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on the declining net debt balance, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $380 million in 2022. Turning to income taxes, we had a 15.9% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect the full year effective tax rate to remain around 16%. The rate for 2022 is not impacted by the R&D matter I discussed earlier because that legislation impacts cash taxes, not the effective tax rate. The 2022 rate also assuming there's no other enacted legislation impacting corporate tax rates. From a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the first quarter rate to be lower due to the timing of certain tax items, so the rate for the remainder of the year will naturally be higher given the full year forecast. Quarter activity and backlog were once again a strong story with a 1 to 1 ratio for the company in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill on the quarter and 1.6x for the full year. As a result, the Group's backlog was up 40% in the past year. Technologies recorded a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 and within that group GDIT was 1.1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value which includes options and IDIQ contracts of over $127 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2022 and wrap up remarks. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. And with that, I will turn to your expectations for 2022. So let me provide our operating forecasts for '22 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll up. In Aerospace, we expect 2022 revenue to be around $8.4 billion, up around 4% over 2021 with about 123 deliveries, up from 119 last year. Operating margin will be around 4.8%. So, a little color here about what is driving this forecast. Well anticipated deliveries are up only 4 units from '21, production of completed aircraft is considerably more than in 2021. Last year, we produced fewer than 119 aircraft that were delivered. We delivered a number of test aircraft that were either produced and completed in prior periods as well as a few demonstrators all up about 11 aircraft. In 2022, production we are building some G700s and G800 test articles that will not deliver this year. Finally, our ability to ramp up further in '22 is limited by the wing supply issue I described earlier, which will be remedied for '23. This leads me to a quick look at '23 and '24. In 2023, we expect to deliver 148 airplanes, 25 more than in 2022 and have revenue of approximately $2 billion more than '22, with margin improvement around 200 basis points. In '24, we expect to deliver around 170 airplanes, up another 22 driving another $1.6 billion of revenue over '23 and another 100 basis points of margin growth. So, all up over that 2-year near-term timeframe, we expect to see $3.6 billion of revenue growth over '22 and 300 basis points of higher operating margins. Mind you, none of this is supported by heroic assumptions about continuing demand. We assume a book-to-bill of around 1 to 1 during the period, a notable reduction from this year's demand. If demand is greater, it will impact favorably '24 and '25. In short, we fully expect Aerospace to be a significant growth engine for both revenue and earnings in 2023 and 2024. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue in the range of $7.15 billion to $7.25 billion, a modest reduction against '21. We expect operating margin to be about the same at 14.5%. Growth should resume later in our planned period as developmental programs move into production and several anticipated international orders should be received. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.8 billion, a $300 million increase over '21. Operating margin in '22 is anticipated to improve to around 8.6%. The long-term driver of growth here is submarine work, which will expand as the supply chain improves its efficiency and delivers modules to the Groton waterfront in a more timely fashion. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to increase margins in the period. We expect revenue in Technologies in the range of $12.8 billion to $13 billion. This is a growth of around 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect operating margins around 10%. So, for 2022, company-wide, we expect to see approximate $39.2 billion to $39.45 billion of revenue, and an operating margin of 10.8%. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12 to $12.15 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years, with Q1 about $2.45 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this forecast is purely from operations that assumes a 16% tax provision, and it seems we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with yearend figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator :  We take our first question from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron Epstein : Yes, good morning, Phebe and . Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Ron. Ron Epstein : I know you're going to get bombarded with Gulfstream questions. So, I'm not going to go there. I'll let everybody else do that. I just wanted to jump in -- yes, how about that. Maybe on Land Systems at first, right. I mean, the Ukraine and everything going on with Russia has been in the headlines, what does that mean for your international Land Systems business, particularly in Eastern Europe? Phebe Novakovic : Well, for some time now, the Eastern European demand for combat vehicles has been at elevated level. But I have to tell you that speculation about the considerable tension in Eastern Europe and any subsequent impact on budgets is just still advised given the high threat environment. So, we are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. But that is a national security issue for the U.S and its allies. Ron Epstein : Got it. And then maybe my follow-on question, if I can. And I shift back a little bit towards Gulfstream. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. Ron Epstein : You mentioned in your prepared remarks, you've got a little bit of a bottleneck in wing production. Have you thought about re-outsourcing wing? Or do you look at the wing as to something you guys want to keep? Because it's a key part of the plan. Phebe Novakovic : Outsourcing, you sort of add a question given the problems in the supply chain on wings, which then drove us to internally source. And frankly, our wing production efficiency is not equal by any. This is just simply a question of expanding a wing facility just to touch and we need another set of tools. But we are very good at wing production. So, I think that that's a capability set that reduces a lot of risk and frankly, provides opportunity for the program. Operator : The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much, and congratulations on the good results. So, Phebe \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Cai von. Cai von Rumohr : \u2026 net R&D was up $50 million in the fourth quarter. What do you expect it to be up going forward? And as I look out there, the 100 bps margin uptick I haven't calculated exactly looks like less than a 25% incremental margin. So how come it's not better as we get out to 2024? Phebe Novakovic : Well R&D, we expect to be about $100 million for next year, but let Jason give you a little bit of color. Jason Aiken : Yes, so as Phebe said, roughly $100 million increase in the Gulfstream R&D for 2022 as we continue to progress, as you'd expect to the flight test program on the G700. If you normalize for that delta, margins for next year would be roughly 14% for the Aerospace group. So that really does kind of answer the question on incremental margins I think from our perspective. Otherwise, we do continue to see, as you'd expect, the incremental profit from in-production airplanes 500 and 600 in particular, continuing to be additive to the group's margin. So \u2026 Cai von Rumohr : Sure. And the last one \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : It is a pretty good margin in the out years. Cai von Rumohr : They are. R&D credit, how big are you assuming? Jason Aiken : So, as I said, we're looking without the R&D credit deferral, meaning assuming existing law persists, we'll be in the call at 100% plus conversion range. If the R&D credit is deferred -- current law is deferred, we're talking more in the 110% range. So that kind of gives you a size on what we're expecting. Operator : The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes. Phebe, the four higher deliveries in '22 that you spoke about, are they G700 or what's the status? Because I know, you thought that you deliver some G700s in the fourth quarter. Phebe Novakovic : What we said I think is that we expected the certification in the fourth quarter with -- but I think the way I have, as I noted in my remarks, we're going to have some prebuild, about the 700s and the 800s, which we'll deliver shortly thereafter, the 700s little shortly thereafter the certification. Jason Aiken : And a little more color on that, George. I mean, just to think about it, obviously, we talked about, as Phebe said, fourth quarter certification and EIS of the 700. But there's also obviously with 2021, you have 500 -- excuse me, 550s that were delivered in the early part of the year that doesn't replicate. So, the incremental four is an offset of that decline as well as the test airplanes that Phebe mentioned that we delivered last year and some demonstrators, but otherwise steady increases in all of the in-production models, particularly 600 and 500. So, I think overall, if you look at in-production airplanes 650, 600 and 500, 280, we're looking at somewhere in the 15% year-over-year increase in production in those models. So that should give you some color on what's driving that increase. George Shapiro : Okay. And then one follow-up. There's a $211 million difference between when you have this gross orders, and effectively just the net orders. Now were there any cancellations, there reflecting the fact that some customers are getting the planes later than they would like to get or \u2026? Phebe Novakovic : No, I don't think there was any particular driver. We have, I think three cancellations, but for no particular reason other than idiosyncratic customer issues. Operator : The next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, could you comment on the \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Good morning, Myles. Myles Walton : \u2026 price environment for building out the backlog and I imagine you're now coming pretty close to lists on all of your programs. And maybe give us an impression of the skyline or the lead time for the large cabin miles at this point? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So, we've enjoyed some pricing pressure or some pricing increases and that's all good and wholesome, and we are quite comfortable where prices are. And our lead times within all production aircraft are well within the 24 or 18 months -- more than 18 months to 24 in that range that we like to see. Myles Walton : Okay, great. And 500 versus 600, can you just give a color on the two differences in demand there. And one might be particularly accretive on the 600, given the assembly commonality with the platform. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so just to give you a little bit of background there, the 600 were the parade in the fourth quarter, followed by the 650 and the 500. The 600 margins are obviously quite nice and 500 are improving. And of course, 600, we've always enjoyed good or 650, we've always enjoyed good margins. So, we're seeing some very nice operating margins at the gross margins at the airplane level. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Robert Stallard : Thanks very much. Phebe, maybe you can touch on some other issues. I just wonder if you can maybe give us some more clarity on the supply chain at this point and some of the obstacles you've been facing across the company whether they're getting any better. Phebe Novakovic : So, let me go group by group. In Combat, we haven't had seen any particular supply chain issues. At Gulfstream, we've managed the supply chain, and I think they were benefited by our reduction in production last year. So, we're quite comfortable with where they are. We reported pretty fulsomely on the Mission Systems challenges that they had with chip shortages and other key product material. And Electric Boat, in particular, we've seen some challenges in the submarine supply chain, largely manifests in Virginia scheduled variants. So, we\u2019ve pretty widely reported that, but we're continuing to work with the Navy and to kind of shore up that supply chain, so we can get normalized Virginia schedules. Robert Stallard : Okay. And then maybe a follow-up to Myles's question on the Aerospace lead times. I think you just said 24 months is what you're seeing, in some case. That sounds a bit longer than what we've maybe heard in recent years. Are you seeing any customers, essentially saying that's too long, and maybe going somewhere else to get their jets? Phebe Novakovic : No, we haven't. And as I said, 18 to 24, but 24 is only a handful of cases. But we haven't had any customers say well, I'll go elsewhere, because we're in the backlog, I'm going to go elsewhere cancel my order because I want my airplane faster. And frankly, we're ramping up production to accommodate that demand, that backlog and what we see is a nice solid demand going forward. So, we're quite comfortable where we are in our lead times. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Just sticky -- Phebe, sticking with supply chain and labor, can you frame the risk to entry into service for the three new aircraft programs, the 700, 800 and the 400? And how we should think about potential slippage or whether you've got that covered at this point? Phebe Novakovic : Well with respect to labor, we've seen some wage increases in engineering forced at Gulfstream, but we have covered those with some increasing prices to offset that. But we don't see any labor issues with respect to the delivery of these airplanes. And as I say the supply chain has been pretty stable here . Robert Spingarn : On labor affecting or clearances affecting technologies at all, is it limiting growth? Phebe Novakovic : So, GDIT, particularly in the tech industry, any company that got large exposure to tech here, experts has certainly have their challenges and mobility, but I will say GDIT is holding up very nicely, attrition is at pre-pandemic levels. So, we're holding our own, but very mindful, this is a valuable workforce and coveted by many. Robert Spingarn : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned : Good morning. Thank you. At the Gulfstream, when you described a pretty high-class problem here in terms of demand. And when you get out to 2023 and 2024, though, you have a pretty diverse set of programs at that point. How do you look at this in terms of both your operations and the supply chain, just to manage that complexity? Phebe Novakovic : So, one thing that Gulfstream -- one of the many things that Gulfstream has been quite good at is managing its operations and having very strong operating leverage. And we have brought the supply chain along with us. So, all of our estimates that we're giving you fully accounting for what we expect the supply chain to be able to manage as well as our own operations. So, we're quite comfortable that we do not have an operating challenge. Douglas Harned : So, no, you're not really seeing any additional issues with this mix when you get out in that timeframe. Phebe Novakovic : No? Operator : The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Phebe, I'll take a question \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : \u2026 in 24 months. I'll wait for it. Hi. So, I'm going to ask about Aero because it is a lot of the EPS expansion we have between '21 and '24. So, you've been so generous with your comments, but I can't quite square away Aerospace margins for 2022. And I was wondering if you could help a little bit with that just given pricing should be a tailwind. And I think mix improved from '21. You have a 500, 600 going up the curve. And I think you previously talked about the G700 being accretive to margins right away. So maybe, can you talk about what's changed? And how do we think about that improvement into '23 and '24? And I know you already guided, but if you could square it away a little bit more? Jason Aiken : Yes, I mean, I think you've got a lot of the basic building blocks, we probably have to compare spreadsheets to see what's driving the ultimate outcome. I think the single biggest issue is probably the period-to-period fluctuation in our net R&D expenditures, right, between supporting the development programs and the net offsets that we get from time-to-time from suppliers. As I mentioned before, we've got about $100 million increase in R&D from -- in '22, relative to '21. So that if you normalize for that you're up from 12 -- 12.7 in 2021 to 14% plus in 2022. There's other puts and takes within that, as you know, pricing is a little better, the improvements along the manufacturing lines for 500 and 600 continue to get better growth in service business, obviously, which continues a pace year-over-year, while at good margins does come at margins that are in an aggregate dilutive to the overall group margin and certainly to new aircraft production margins. And so that's really the story I think, in terms of the puts and takes going into 2022. I think we can get into your details or your question maybe after the fact on '23 and '24. But I think 200 basis points improvement in '23 and another 100 basis point in '24. That kind of gives you that trajectory that we've talked about for some time about returning to the mid to high teens margins for the group. When you combine that with pretty significant top line growth that Phebe described, I think it's a pretty -- I think it's a pretty compelling story. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Can I just ask the follow-up on the R&D? Obviously, it peaks for G700 this year. When do we see that for the 400 and the 800? So, obviously, the 800 comes in -- into play shortly after the 700. So, you should kind of expect to see that following a similar pattern. I think we said the 400 enters service in 2025. So, keep in mind the 400 is an airplane that benefited significantly from commonality with the 500 and 600 in the way those airplanes were designed and engineered. So, we won't necessarily see as much of a blip associated with that, but all of this fits over time within the profile of our ongoing commitment to R&D and roughly 2% of sales for R&D. Again, it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but that's how you ought to see it play out. Operator : The next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Nice results. Phebe, I wanted to ask you a question about Marine. How are they doing in terms of battling kind of the labor shortages out there. I know Pratt yesterday talked about having a shortage of welders, maybe what you could give some commentary how you're seeing that? Phebe Novakovic : So, we have worked for many years with our state and local governments to provide them pretty robust training programs that are still up and running. We are hiring this year at an accelerated rate over what we had anticipated, largely because of the backlog. In terms of hiring in COVID, obviously constrained. These are hiring levels for '22 at levels we have seen before and executed before. So, the question is all about the efficiency of your training programs. And we're pretty comfortable that once we get these people in the door, we can get them trained and have them go as new shipbuilders. They've got learning curves, obviously, as they get more proficient and become veterans, but we factored all of that in our thinking. Peter Arment : Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up to some -- just on Aerospace. It sounds like the customer base continues to expand, how would you kind of characterize it? Is it a lot of the corporates that are renewing? Are you seeing just a complete expansion during this kind of COVID -- post-COVID period? Phebe Novakovic : So, to give you a little bit of additional color on that, demand was quite good in the United States and also increased throughout the rest of the world we saw as we had begun to see earlier, a return to the Fortune 500 as well as private companies as well as smaller companies. So, it's pretty robust across the portfolio and the kinds of both individuals that we see, but also companies that we see. But I don't see any structural change here, if that's kind of what you're poking at in terms of . Operator : The next question \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Operator : The next -- apologies, the next question comes from Seth Seifman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much \u2026 Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Seth. Seth Seifman : \u2026 and good morning. Maybe if I could dig in for a couple of more Aerospace details. There any comments you could give about the services assumptions underlying the guidance, and also the CapEx impact and timing of completion of the additional wing capacity? Phebe Novakovic : So, I'll answer those in the inverse order, almost negligible CapEx. So, this is just simply a timing of -- timing issue of expanding an existing building somewhat and getting in place the tools and fixtures to effectuate the increased production. On the service side, we expect '22 to see some nice service growth at Gulfstream as well as Jet Aviation which have a nice year as well. And we expect service volume quite naturally to grow with the expanding fleet. And we have included those assumptions on a going forward basis. Seth Seifman : Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, definitely heard earlier and appreciate the commentary about the multiyear outlook being conservative. I guess any other sort of support you can give to that characterization would be great. If we look at, I guess, if the backlog remains stable at about $16 billion, looking at like 1.3x coverage out in 2024. And if that's kind of what you're aiming for, and any other color that kind of gives you confidence in the conservatism of the outlook? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so think about it this way. What I wanted to explain is that the guidance that we are giving you for '23 and '24, was based on a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Clearly, if it's better than that, we'll increase production accordingly. But for planning purposes, that's what we have assumed and I think that's prudent planning. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss \u2026 Seth Seifman : So maybe just -- go ahead. Phebe Novakovic : David? Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Okay. Phebe, can you hear me? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Loud and clear. David Strauss : Okay. So, you give us a little bit of a longer-term outlook for Gulfstream. I want to ask about Marine and Combat. I think, Marine, you'd previously said expect kind of $400 million to $500 million in incremental revenue a year. Last year, you were at the high end of that, this year you're forecasting a little bit below that. So maybe if you could update us there on kind of the longer-term thinking. And then on Combat, I think you had said kind of low growth over the next couple of years. Now you're talking about a decline. So, what's the longer-term view, I guess, on Combat? And how much could the fiscal '22 budget that still yet to be decided, but it looks pretty good for you guys how that might influence things? Phebe Novakovic : So, let's talk about Marine. We have for some time said that we expected revenue growth in the $400 million to $500 million range. We still expect that. Next year is a little bit later, a $300 million increase and that's largely just workload timing. When I go to Combat -- so I think what we are anticipating is some decrease in pressure on the army budget. Look, we're  in '23, in particular, so we're pretty early on in the budget for that fiscal year. We don't have full OMB or tax back. But I think that the pressures on the army budget have been very well articulated. And while we expect that ultimately the funding levels for our platform programs will be sufficient and relatively stable, we will see some rather dramatic drop offs in O&M funded accounts, like maintenance, for example. So, we are factoring all of that into what I see is that increased army pressure. We're factoring all of that into our estimate for between 1% and 3% lower growth this year, but we anticipate growth returning as a number of these international orders come in a couple of years as well as new army start. So, I think we have given you a balanced and realistic view of combat. David Strauss : Okay. A quick follow-up, what are you assuming for CR this year in terms of what's -- what you're baked into your defense guidance? Phebe Novakovic : So, for this particular CR, given our portfolio and the prior year funding levels, we don't see a material impact of all, almost nothing. Operator : The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : You already got me. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : You\u2019ve already got David. I need to get . Operator : My apologies. We have Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Matt Akers : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. There was some commentary around the budget discussions about potentially going to the three a year on Virginia class. Could you comment on how feasible that is and sort of what further investments required? What kind of time frame that might be possible? Phebe Novakovic : So, we've been talking to our navy customer and clearly, some investments would be required. But I think, too, at the moment, we need to get the supply chain stabilized on the two-a-year cadence before we actually think about really ramping up to three. It is doable. We just need some time for that supply chain to adjust from the ravages of COVID. Matt Akers : Great, thanks. And I guess a couple of details within the cash flow outlook for '22. Can you say how big the impact of that prebuild is that you discussed at Gulfstream and then also can you just update what's the latest on the large international receivable? And is that meaningful as an impact for 2022? Jason Aiken : Yes. I think on the Gulfstream side, while we are having, as Phebe mentioned, the ramp-up on the 700 and the prebuild on the 800, that's not a material impact that we see in terms of the headwind. Gulfstream wants to be a nice producer of cash again this year. Obviously, not quite to the extent that last year, we -- as we mentioned, we sold off the inventory, in particular, in the test airplanes. So, it won't have quite the trajectory it did last year, but it will still be a nice contributor on cash. So, don't see that as a headwind. On the international side, the international Canadian vehicle program we've talked about for some time remains on track. That program is in a great position, both in terms of the vehicle and the performance of the production line, and we continue to receive payments as scheduled for the renegotiated extension of that contract that occurred back in 2020. So, all in a good place in that regard. Howard Rubel : Operator, we will take one last question. Please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. So, our final question then comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Richard Safran : Hi. Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Howard. How are you? Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Richard Safran : So, on Technologies, I was impressed by that $32 billion comment that you made. What percent of that is adjudicated in '22? Is it all of it? And would you be able to tell me how much of that is recompetes? And I asked because I'm assuming that recompetes come with a bit of a higher win probability. Phebe Novakovic : Those are largely new work in the $32 billion and the customer adjudicates that as they get to it. But I think we've recognized as well that not only is the customer decision cycle, but it's also their protests that affect the timing of any of these wins, and they're significant. Richard Safran : Yes. And just as a very quick follow-up here. Jason, I heard your opening comments about what you were going to do with debt. And I wanted to know, just to be clear, your fourth quarter maturities, is that the extent of debt reduction this year? And if you would, longer term, could you just tell me what your overall debt reduction target is? And when do you think you might be able to get there? Jason Aiken : Yes. The $1 billion that matures in November of this year is the only maturity this year. So, you've got that right. In terms of the longer term, we will obviously play that out as it goes. We've indicated that we have a reasonable debt laddered out over the next several years that offers us the opportunity to continue to step down the debt in, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion increments over time. That said, we've never indicated we were going to go back to the essentially zero net debt that we had before the CSRA acquisition. So somewhere in that period with flexibility remaining open, we will decide where the right point is to settle out on that. And frankly, if there's an overarching sort of guiding light that we have around that, it's continuing to target and try to sustain a mid-A credit rating. And obviously, there's a lot of factors that go into that, but that's really sort of the compass that we have around the debt trajectory. Howard Rubel : Well, thank you all for joining our call today. And as a reminder, please refer to our website for the fourth quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation, which will now include our outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Katie? Operator : Thank you all for joining. This now concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I will now hand over to your host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations for General Dynamics. Over to you, Howard. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $908 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is flat against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are down $30 million, but net earnings are up $22 million in line which distorts the truly strong performance of the operating units. The improvement in net earnings was aided by less interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes against the year ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share are up $0.13 or 5.2% year-over-year. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, 30 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was as anticipated in our earlier guidance to you, but also shaped by the aforementioned expense at the corporate other line. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.10 per share. We have roughly $400 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $20 million more in operating earnings. We also beat our own expectations, particularly so in aerospace, about which I will have more to say shortly. As we indicated in our press release, cash from operating activities is just shy of $2 billion and about 270% of net income. After capital expenditures, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, 250% of net income. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is, in important respects, a very strong quarter, a good foundation for the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around the spectacular cash performance, backlog, taxes, deployment of cash and the makeup of the corporate other line then we'll answer your questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed another strong quarter. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $243 million with a 12.8% operating margin. Revenue was $16 million ahead of last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 3 fewer aircraft. Revenue was almost $180 million higher than anticipated by the sell side. The difference is almost entirely growth at Gulfstream Services and Jet Aviation. Operating earnings of $243 million or $23 million ahead of last year's first quarter, a 10.5% increase and well ahead of sell-side expectations. The 12.8% operating margin is 110 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. Here, the gross margin on delivered aircraft was slightly better, particularly the 500, but fully offset by increased R&D spending. The improvement comes from higher service revenue, coupled with significantly better margin on net revenue. On the Gulfstream side of the service business, it was the result of an extremely attractive business mix. For Jet Aviation, it was strong performance at the FBOs in the United States. Aerospace also had another very strong quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream aircraft orders alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. The order activity at Gulfstream was strong across the board, but driven by orders for the 650. Strong sales activity and customer interest continues so far this quarter as well. The U.S. market remains robust with some slight improvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. China remains slow. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stopped activity in Eastern Europe and slowed activity in Western Europe. All of this, however, is trumped by the strength of the U.S. market. I should add that flight activity is increasing in Western Europe, including flights to the U.S. This is a good leading indicator of an improving market in Western Europe. On the new product front, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a steady basis and quality is superb. As of the end of the quarter, Gulfstream has over 160 of these aircraft in service, will support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. In first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups. Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and a stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for Technologies was 1.1:1, led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1 :1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of this quarter's awards represented new business. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. We have 5 flight test aircraft that have completed over 2,800 flight hours. We also have conducted over 25,000 hours of laboratory simulated flying. All structural testing is complete and all structural requirements have been met. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. The new Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 designed specifically to match the G700 aerodynamic to optimize speed, range, emission and fuel burn will be certified in the next few months. The engine is performing well and exceeding key performance parameters. Our final step toward entry into service is to complete certification flying with the FAA. This is typically the most predictable part of our test program. All of this has been achieved during a pandemic and a certification process made increasingly rigorous due to industry events unrelated to Gulfstream. In that connection, this flight test process has a first-time requirement that was not part of our original flight test plan or any prior development effort. It is a model-based developmental software validation, a line-by-line examination of the plane software. The level of effort is considerable, completing 100% of the software validation is the impediment to finishing performance testing by the FAA and G800 first flight. I can assure you that the validation work to date has proceeded well and presented no surprises. It is just resource and time intensive. This leads me to some comments on the timing of certification. We continue to target certification of the G700 for the fourth quarter of this year, but the ultimate timing is dependent on the FAA. It seems prudent for us at this time to recognize the risk of a 3- to 6-month slip in the process and to plan for it accordingly. If such a slip were to occur, we have offset any impact to our 2022 financial plan with an increase of deliveries of current production aircraft. This would also not adversely impact 2023. It also remains our view that the G800 certification will follow the G700 by 6 to 9 months. Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft. Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircraft with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarters as we have previously indicated. So far, supply chain issues have been in the news in this category. However, we expect an increasing number of issues in this regard later in the year and believe we are on a path to work through them successfully. In short, off to a very good start at Aerospace. Next, Combat. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.68 billion, down 8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $227 million are down 7%. The numbers are reasonably consistent with our outlook and sell-side expectations. Margins at 13.6% are a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter, so strong operating performance. Stryker and Abrams have considerable support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. And first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia-class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups. Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and the stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for technology is 1.1:1 led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1 :1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of the quarter's awards represented new business. So good order activity in the quarter and good order prospects on the horizon. GDIT alone submitted over $5 billion in the quarter, bringing the number of submitted proposals in the decision or protest queue to $29 billion. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, provide you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks and then we'll take your questions. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is the unusually high corporate operating expense of $71 million in the quarter, which is up from $32 million in the year ago quarter. Given our full year expectation of around $110 million in corporate expense this year, you might have expected a first quarter number similar to last year. However, this year was impacted by a change to some of the terms of our equity compensation plan, which resulted in the acceleration of the expense associated with those awards. This was a onetime noncash item, and you should expect a lower corporate expense in the remaining quarters to result in our full year outlook of $110 million. If you consider the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, excluding this corporate expense anomaly, the segment margins improved from 10.3% a year ago to 10.4% this quarter. Turning to our cash performance. We had the strongest first quarter we've seen in some time. Following several years of negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this quarter was a marked improvement due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international vehicle program at Combat Systems. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $2 billion for a conversion rate of 270% of net income. Including capital expenditures of $141 million, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion or a conversion rate of 250%. So the quarter was well ahead of our expectations, some of which was favorable timing in our operating working capital, but the performance certainly reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter or 1.5% of sales, which is consistent with last year. We're still planning for CapEx to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. We also paid $330 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend nearly 6% to $1.26 per share. And we spent over $290 million on the repurchase of $1.3 million of our shares at an average price of almost $225 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down $2.8 billion from this time last year and about $1.3 billion below the year-end position. Net interest expense in the quarter was $98 million, down from $123 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in 2022 is due to the $1.5 billion reduction in debt last year. We have another $1 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we'll have more to say about our plans related to those notes as we get closer to their maturity in November. The tax rate in the quarter at 14% benefited from the timing of equity compensation activity and associated deductions, consistent with our expectations. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But, of course, that implies a higher rate for the balance of the year to arrive at that outcome. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1 :1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill, which is also the book-to-bill for the group over the last 12 months. As a result, aerospace backlog has increased by almost 50% in the past year. Technologies and Combat Systems also had solid quarters with a 1.1x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.2 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129 billion. Finally, a quick note on our expectations for EPS progression for the balance of the year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly $0.10 above the first quarter with more significant steps up in the second half of the year. Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Mariana Perez Mora : This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. Phebe Novakovic : Before you get into your question, some of you may have noted an interesting juxtaposition of the subjects in my remarks. And I'll just note this the capacity for technology to air is endless. So nonetheless, I hope you got the message. All right, go ahead. Mariana Perez Mora : That's fine. We got the message, right, but we got it. So on aero, you mentioned strong volumes and margins at services, could you please give us some more color on what were the main drivers? And please help us understand how sustainable are those volumes on margins? Phebe Novakovic : So we had higher R&D, but we had a very strong margin performance in services and a particularly good mix in service R&D at Gulfstream. We had also some improvement in gross margins. So that mix drove margins. Mariana Perez Mora : And how sustainable are the volumes of services? Did anything change in the services business? Phebe Novakovic : We think that, that particular mix is going to be hard to replicate. But for the moment, we're sticking to our margin guidance that we gave you. Just to remind everybody, it is our custom to update you at the end of the second quarter with a full and detailed analysis of our prospects for the rest of the year by group and then a wrap up for the whole company. But we'll stick with what we've got now. We're off to a good start, however. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Myles Walton : Phebe, on your comment around the software validation approach and the certification, is that something that's been recently added after the original certification plan was agreed to? Or is it just that you're getting to the point where you're having to accomplish this new element of your... Phebe Novakovic : No. This was an added process that we had not contemplated when we originally laid out our certification plan. And it's a result of events that are independent of us. Myles Walton : I see. Okay. And then on the free cash flow, Jason, is it the case it looks like unbilled was pretty favorable, and we know about the U.K. combat vehicle, but did the -- sorry, about the Canadian combat vehicle. But did the U.K. combat vehicle also start to pay out? Jason Aiken : No. As you point out, we continue to receive steady payments on the international program that we reset a couple of years ago. So that continues apace. We're still working through issues with the customer on the U.K. side. So we hope to see that resolved later this year. . Operator : Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. David Strauss : Phebe, could you touch on a little bit more on marine margins, I think at 8%, that's the lowest we've seen in a while. I think you've talked in the past about that business eventually getting 9% plus kind of margins. So can you talk about what exactly happened in the first quarter and the progression from here to get to that above 9% level? Phebe Novakovic : So as we've noted before, margins will be compressed as we work down our learning curves on Colombia. And as you may recall, we are booking initial Columbia at a conservative margin. That, coupled with the well-publicized supply chain scheduling issues in Virginia, have driven some margin compression. But we expect those to stabilize over time as well. Jason Aiken : And just to add to that, David, and put another point on what Phebe mentioned there, the Columbia program, while we saw growth, as she mentioned in all 3 of the shipyards, the Columbia program did bring more than half of the volume increase in the quarter. So just from a mix perspective, those are early margin rates on that program are impacting the aggregate margin for the group, too. David Strauss : Okay. And Phebe, I mean the outlook for this business longer term, you still think it can -- as Colombia gets further into production, do you still think it can be a 9% to 10% margin business? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. As we get further into production, the schedule stabilize on Virginia and both Bath and NASSCO will also contribute. So we are targeting that, and we believe that, that is fully achievable. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Phebe, you mentioned the outlook for Gulfstream, both for this year and reinforced the guidance for next year. So I understand that that's where we're headed in terms of deliveries. But I guess can you walk through the mechanics a little bit more? If Gulfstream needs to see a significant step-up in deliveries at the second half at the same time that we'll be seeing incremental supply chain issues and then there might be a need to backfill some G700 deliveries in 2023 with those supply chain issues potentially still out there kind of some of the things that give you confidence in that delivery outlook given those sort of qualitative headwinds that you talked about? Phebe Novakovic : So with respect to the supply chain, we are working through all of those. And we don't see those as impacting our '23 or '24 estimates that we gave you. Our estimates on Gulfstream are predicated on the current demand environment, which has been strong, as I noted, continues into this quarter along with our backlog. So we're pretty comfortable that we've got both the supply chain, the manufacturing capability to meet all of those 2 out-year requirements. And as I noted in my remarks, if -- should there be a slip, then we will increase in production aircraft this year. But look, with respect to that slip -- potential slip, we wanted to be as transparent as possible to give you some insight when we saw it and then tell you that how we were going to address that so that there's no economic impact from that in either year '23 or '24. Seth Seifman : And then as a follow-up, Jason, I guess, maybe you mentioned you talked about addressing the debt on the next call maybe, but we could ask for a little bit of a preview. Just in terms of how you're thinking about it generally, there's probably some debt due each year for the next several years. We just saw one of your peers look to kind of term things out for a while. How do you think about where you want to take the capital structure from here and the role of debt repayment now that interest rates are going up? Jason Aiken : Yes. I think our overarching approach to this remains unchanged. We continue to target the mid-A credit rating and want to get our metrics in line with that for the long term. In keeping with that, I think you can expect us to retire this debt that we see coming due later this year. What happens after that, I think, remains a little bit in play. We'll have to see because we talked about the elevated debt we had post CSRA acquisition and the fact that we intended to bring that down, but we never intended to get back to the level we had been with essentially 0 net debt prior to that acquisition. So now we're getting into the range looking ahead into the next couple of years where we're probably going to be evaluating, is this the place to land. We don't have an answer to that yet, but that's going to become more of the conversation. So we'll see where that plays out. I expect at this point that we'll go ahead and retire the debt that matures at the end of this year, but then we'll be more active in that conversation. But again, I think, ultimately, targeting that mid-A credit rating and everything that is attended to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Phebe, you mentioned the very strong order performance in Aerospace this quarter. But I was wondering what sort of impact this has had on the lead time for Jet, specifically the G650 you mentioned? Whether this is starting to have any sort of impact on customer demand? Are people like saying it's going to take too long to get my jet? Phebe Novakovic : No, we've managed that lead times very successfully. So present and even given the robust demand, we do not see that as an issue. Robert Stallard : And just a follow-up, how is the pricing environment evolved over the last 3 months? . Phebe Novakovic : Well, as you know, we are reticent and loathe to talk about pricing, but you can imagine that the pricing has kept pace with other economic factors. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, I was hoping to dig in to Combat a little bit and just ask what types of products you expect European nations to demand most? And to what extent do you expect those to be products from Combat Systems and particularly from ELS? Phebe Novakovic : So should the recent threat environment drive increased spending in rearming and recapitalizing land forces, we will see an increase in demand. And I suspect it to be aligned along our ordinance business as well as our vehicle business, both in the United States and at ELS. But I'm careful not to get ahead of our customers here. Robert Spingarn : Do you see much opportunity in technologies, perhaps for mission or even GDIT maybe on the cyber side over there? Phebe Novakovic : There could be some because clearly in today's war fighting environment, interoperability on networks and communication is critical and reliable interoperability. So I suspect there could be some increased demand, but we have not seen any of that so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Can you comment on inflation? When you look forward, obviously, we're in perhaps a difficult inflationary environment. In terms of how you see it affecting, both on the Gulfstream side and on the government customer side, in terms of what you can pass through? What could pressure margins? Phebe Novakovic : So let me address that holistically across the company because we've dealt with inflationary pressures and increases in commodity costs in varying ways through a portfolio of actions. One is our contract architecture. A second is to the extent possible price increases. We've cut costs in other areas to offset some of the increases and then where possible we've had commodity substitutions and part substitutions. So that combination of arrows in our quiver has mitigated any impact. And at the moment, we do not project a margin compression as a result of increased prices. Douglas Harned : So your -- so you see -- are these things that you would have not done before? Are you doing things that offset -- basically reduce your costs in other ways? Or is it more on the ability to pass through some of the price increases? Phebe Novakovic : I can't give you a very -- I can't unpack that and give you a very clear distinction between which of these capabilities or which of these tools has resulted in the largest impact on our ability to offset inflationary increases, but -- because it's a combination of things. In some contracts, you've got contract architecture that protects you. In other cases, you take additional cost cuts that you had not anticipated taking before. But one of the things you expect from a company with strong operating leverage is when a cost increases somewhere else, you have to find offsetting cost reductions. And so we have historically done that, and we're continuing to do that. And then in some instances, you can have product substitutions. That's not particularly frequently, but it can happen in some critical products. So I think it's that panoply of weapons that we've used to offset these increases. Operator : Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: So I wanted to ask about R&D profile of the business for Gulfstream in 2022, '23 and '24, since you've given guidance for Gulfstream profitability. When we think about the G700, the G800 and the 400, what's the magnitude of the investment you have to put in to work with the FAA? Or is it more of a heavy time burden? Like how do we think about that, Phebe, in terms of dollar amount? Or is it just more time and a push out of notification and deliveries? . Phebe Novakovic : Well, as we've noted, it's more a question of time resources, certainly on the new requirements. But you saw an increase in R&D this quarter. And it was because that we have this new set of software validation requirements that we need to walk through, and we've accommodated that in our plan. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Jason Aiken : Yes, just making sure we understand the nature of your question. I mean if it's about this potential risk that Phebe talked about and the additional effort we have to undertake in the certification process, it is both a time risk, but, of course, cost travels with time. And so there's the burden of the additional effort that goes on, the man hours that have to occur to accomplish those tasks. So it puts some pressure on the R&D budget. And as Phebe said, you saw some of that even in the first quarter. But I don't think any of this is enough to change the profile of what we've talked about either from an R&D spend in the aggregate in the '22, '23, '24 time frame or as we think about it in terms of the margin rate impact that it has on the business. So again, just to recap where we see this, we're in an elevated state this year. It will remain elevated in '23. And then once we get the 700 and the 800 certified, it remains somewhat elevated, but will notch down a step down in '24 as the effort shifts more towards the 400, and then we'll see it sort of return back to more of a normal run rate level beyond 2024. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: And then maybe one more on technology. How are you thinking about the Technologies portfolio? I think it has a lot of good businesses in there, but organic growth hasn't been as robust as say Marine. So how do you think about the good businesses in that portfolio overall? Do you like it as a whole as a combined technology of an ammunition business? Or any thoughts to that? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. We spent a fair amount of time early on after the acquisition of CSRA, trimming that portfolio both in our IT business as well as in our Mission Systems business. So we like the mix of lines of business that we have right now. We believe they're complementary, and we believe that they're good growth engines, but I don't know that we heard your questions that clearly, but if one of them was -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but if one of them was comparing this to Marine growth, very few items in the defense budget are going to grow as reliably and as robustly as the submarine and shipbuilding accounts. So I wouldn't hold that as the metric, I think continued steady growth on the top line. But more importantly, the bottom line in Technologies has really been our focus. Does that make sense? Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Maugeri from Wolfe Research. Michael Maugeri : I think historically, sort of your commentary has been for $400 million to $500 million of annual revenue growth at Marine sort of implies some moderation from here. Growth has been strong over the last few years, maybe some risk retirements coming through on Columbia class. So with that said, I mean, is there any sort of good reason to think that growth should moderate over the next few years at Marine? Phebe Novakovic : No. We continue to project $400 million to $500 million a year on average. You'll see some perturbations in quarterly growth, largely driven by material sales, but nothing that changes the trajectory. Michael Maugeri : And then sticking with Marine, can you speak to the pipeline at Bath, maybe some upside there as it might relate to hypersonic work on DDG-1000, additional work for DDG-51? Or are we sort of pretty much tapped out there from a capacity standpoint? Phebe Novakovic : Well, yes, those are mixing kind of 2 different predicates. One, there's been a lot of talk about integrating various weapon systems on to shipboard platforms, but we haven't yet seen any of that materialize. And so it is not a question about capacity. We have adequate capacity that we expanded and updated and upgraded in the last few years through our capital deployment improvements at Bath and frankly, the other shipyards. So it's simply a question of the demand coming out of the U.S. Navy, and we haven't had any surprises there. They're continuing with respect to Bath and maybe have continued to support DDG-51 production. So we expect that to be a steady pace going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Peter Arment : Phebe, maybe just circle back on your comment regarding the pipeline increasing potentially with Combat. I'm just curious about your overall comments on how we should expect it's eventually show up in backlog. Should we consider this more of a '23 and '24 event when we're thinking about that? And then just as a follow-up related to kind of the budget outlook, just now that we've gotten the '23 requests and we saw what was enacted for '22. Maybe you could just give some high level thoughts on GD is faring given the request? Phebe Novakovic : If you're talking specifically about Combat, I think that it's hard to give projections about timing when, in fact, the budgets for the most part, have not materialized in significant increases. But were they to in the land forces and land forces modernization, we have every expectation that the vehicle -- combat vehicles demand will increase and ordinance and armaments will increase. So I think it's premature to bake in any assumptions about growth until you really see some of that. And I would say that one of the interesting things that we have not quite seen at the same level is the Abrams interest from multiple U.S. allies. So we'll have to see how that plays out over time. There are some potential out there. But as I said, I don't want to get too far ahead of our customers here, got to see how all this -- takes time to get from the threat to full funding to allocation of awards. I think you'll hear that from a lot of folks, not just us. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : So Phebe, at Bath you recently had a mid-contract wage hike where the lower 5 of the 10 pay grades had a pay hike of over 20%. Now I assume mix is an issue, but could you comment on what that impact is on labor availability and cost and is there any read across to electric boat that this should be a concern there, too? Phebe Novakovic : So the wage increase at Bath is an attempt to help stabilize the manufacturing workforce and build ships faster. So this, in turn, will ultimately help competitiveness and margins. So we think we can fully address any cost impact. And I think the touch labor market has been less impacted by some of the well-publicized labor shortages and they tend to be more regional to the extent that they've existed. So we do -- we take each one of our lines of business on a case-by-case basis and then react accordingly. But Bath was a special set of circumstances given Maine and the realities in Maine regarding workforce. Cai Von Rumohr : And then switching gears a little bit, what impact do the Russian sanctions have on your business at Gulfstream? . Phebe Novakovic : So to the extent that we expected an impact we anticipated it to show up at Jet Aviation in some of their European locations. But they were -- Jet was able to offset that with additional volume. With respect to Russia, as I noted, I think, before, they are less than 5% of our Gulfstream backlog and we had no deliveries this quarter, obviously. We've had no cancellations. And we have, in this demand environment, been able to manage the relatively few number of Russian airplanes in our backlog. So we do not see an impact at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : I wonder if you could talk on Technologies, a couple of things. I guess, one, I think you commented on some supply chain impacts on Mission Systems, just how those are trending. And then also just the timing of some of these new awards and when they get start to ramp up. Phebe Novakovic : So we discussed, I think, with you, I think starting maybe in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, the -- some of the chip shortages that we were experiencing at Mission Systems that was constraining the ability to deliver a series of different kinds of products. So we have largely worked through those issues at Mission Systems, but we are now contending with the pent-up demand that resulted -- was generated by last year's slower deliveries as a result of chip shortages. And as we work through that, that ought to be upside for Mission Systems on the revenue side as we go forward. And then the timing of new orders typically at GDIT, they tend to be a -- tend to have a quarter lag or quarter and half lag from time of award to new starts. So we'll see some of the more recent larger awards begin to show up next quarter and then increasing over time. Matthew Akers : And if I could on Gulfstream, I mean one of the questions I've gotten is how sort of sustainable this business could be if we do go into a recession? I guess can you just talk about if that come up at all with your customers, are people concerned about the economic outlook, and sort of how resilient do you think this business could be if we do have a downturn? Phebe Novakovic : Well, we haven't heard a whole lot of that in the pipeline, but let's pass this prologue here. And I think what we have demonstrated repeatedly at Gulfstream is that Gulfstream is a very good cyclical. And in the past, what we've seen is relatively short economic perturbations and a pretty quick recovery at Gulfstream. So I think our job is to manage and play the cards that are dealt to us, and we've done so very effectively. So you can probably estimate the future of the U.S. economy better than we can. That seems to be a great support and get a Nobel prize if you get it right. But we're quite comfortable at the moment on where we stand, and I'm very comfortable with Gulfstream's ability to continue to be a good cyclical. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Phebe, looking at the fiscal year '23 budget request, we're seeing a generational investment in the nuclear triad benefiting the Columbia-class. And we're also seeing advanced capabilities like safety systems seeing outsized growth. So as you look at your portfolio, with the IT business stable, leverage has come significantly down, what's your appetite to add a new vertical to the business to capture more of this outsized growth in advanced capabilities that you may not have today? Phebe Novakovic : No, I think we do not discuss potential acquisitions or divestitures, but we like where we are positioned to take advantage of the recapitalization of the triad. You want to ask another question? Kristine Liwag : Yes. And maybe following on capital deployment then. Understanding that you're not going to talk about large M&A, what about additional priorities for cash? How should we think about dividend payments versus share repurchases, particularly as you're in the leverage where you want to be and the business is generating significant amount of free cash flow? Jason Aiken : I think fundamentally, there's no change to the way we've articulated our capital deployment priorities. We talked a little earlier about the dividend increase earlier this year. That was the 25th annual -- consecutive annual increase. We've made pretty clear the significant investments we've been making in the business over the past several years. And now really, if you will, if there's any pivot at all, it's shifting back the attention more toward rewarding those patient shareholders with return of capital and share repurchases. And you've seen us do that last year. We embarked on that a little bit in the first quarter, and I think you should expect to see us continue that in a tactical and opportunistic way. M&A is always opportunistic. And as Phebe said, not something that we disclose out in front of anything. So that's kind of how you should expect us to behave. Howard Rubel : And operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our final question for today comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : Phebe, you had $104 million cancellation in the quarter. And I guess from what you said in response to the question before, it wasn't due to Russia. So if you could tell us where that might have been? Phebe Novakovic : We had one cancellation. And I have no clue where it was, but it wasn't Russia. And that... George Shapiro : Yes. That's fine. And then Jason, where the payments from the Canadian contract in the first quarter similar to last year's first quarter, which was around $1 billion? And also, do you expect more to occur this year as well? . Jason Aiken : Yes. Payment levels this year are very similar to last year, both in the first quarter and for the balance of the year. So the pattern should be pretty similar. And again, that customer has been very consistent in their payments since we negotiated the recast of that program. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A for today. I will hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Alex. And thank everybody else for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for our first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you very much for your attention today. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I now have the pleasure of handing the call over to our host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. So, Howard, please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic isn't able to join us this morning. She recently came down with COVID, but not to worry she's on the mend and doing well, but she's asked me to cover today's call. With me is Bill Moss, our Vice President and Corporate Controller who will cover some of the financial particulars that I would normally address. So, with that let's get into the results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.75 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $978 million, earnings before taxes of $923 million, and net income of $766 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Earnings before taxes were up $42 million and net earnings were up $29 million. Earnings per share were up $0.14, a 5.4% increase. To be a little more granular, we enjoyed revenue increases at Aerospace and Marine Systems offset by declines at Combat Systems and Technologies. We also had margin improvement in three of the four segments which led to higher operating earnings and earnings before taxes against the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.03 per share on somewhat lower revenue, but somewhat higher operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. This led to the modest earnings beat. On a year-to-date basis, revenue, for all practical purposes, was even with last year's first half. Similarly, operating earnings were essentially flat, but earnings before taxes were up $46 million, net earnings were up $51 million, and EPS was up $0.25, almost 5%. In the quarter, free cash flow of $435 million was 57% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 86% of net income. This was pretty good in light of the powerful first quarter cash. To that point, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.3 billion was 151% of net earnings. In summary, we had a solid quarter from an earnings perspective and the year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Bill add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then I'll provide updated guidance. I'll try to keep my remarks brief to leave ample opportunity for questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.9 billion, operating earnings of $238 million and a 12.7% operating margin. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. Operating earnings are up $43 million or 22.1% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins. So increased sales volume coupled with improved margins leads to very good operating leverage. We captured improved revenue on only 22 deliveries. We didn't deliver four G500 and 600s that were scheduled to deliver in the quarter. They've been deferred at customer request to the third quarter awaiting removal of the FAA wind directive. However, nine G500 and 600s in fact were delivered to customers in the quarter. So we delivered nine of the 13 that were planned in the quarter. From an order perspective, we did very well once again. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2 :1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 2.7:1 even stronger if expressed in unit terms. As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February 2021 and continued on to the second quarter of this year. The pipeline and sales activity remain strong as we enter this quarter. The Farnborough Air Show was a good one for us. From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We're making good progress in the flight test of the software update for landing and high winds and expect removal of the FAA directive in mid-September. You may recall that last quarter we advised you of a risk of a three to six month delay for certification of the G700 to second quarter 2023, as a result of the time-consuming work on model-based software validation. As a result of the flight sciences engineering resources we needed to redeploy onto the work related to the G500 and 600 FAA limitation on landings and high wind conditions, the risk to the G700 schedule has become a reality. As we've previously advised, this will not adversely impact our financial plan for 2022 and 2023. We feel confident that the G800 will follow the G700 by about six months. Looking forward, we've planned 123 deliveries for the year and we fully expect to do just that. Turning to Defense. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.7 billion, down 12.3% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was impacted by Ajax at both Land Systems and ELS bomb bodies at OTS and some program mix. Operating earnings of $245 million were off against last year's quarter by 7.9% with a 70 basis point improvement in margins. Operating margin was a strong 14.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, Combat Systems revenue was down 10.2% and operating earnings were down only 7.5% on a 40-basis point improvement in margins.  In June, Land Systems was awarded the Mobile Protected Firepower contract the first all-new combat vehicle for the army in decades. The initial award for LRIP-1 was $410 million for 25 vehicles. The program of record for LRIP is $1.1 billion for 95 vehicles through 2026. The entire program requirement is 500 vehicles for more than $5 billion. The program fills a critical gap in the Army's infantry brigade combat force and we expect to move out swiftly on the program.  The quarter was very good for Combat Systems from an orders perspective with a 1.4:1 book-to-bill leading to an increase in total backlog and estimated potential contract value. Demand for our products particularly our combat vehicles, remains strong with Europe leading the way. International order opportunities for Abrams are particularly strong. This was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group in a constrained revenue environment. At Marine Systems, revenue of $2.65 billion was up $115 million over the year ago quarter. It was flat sequentially, but up year-to-date. In the quarter growth was led by Columbia, TAO and repair work volume. For the first half revenue was up $283 million or 5.6%. This is very impressive continued growth. Operating earnings were $211 million in the quarter essentially flat with the year ago quarter as a result of a 30-basis point reduction in margin.  The margin compression was the result of the impact on Electric Boat of additional scheduled delays in the Virginia program from the supply chain as it struggles with recovering from COVID. EB is working closely with the Navy and suppliers including embedding operating and engineering personnel on-site to restore the necessary Virginia program cadence. Nonetheless, Electric Boats performance remained strong and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. Total backlog of almost $42 billion remains robust and is by far the largest of our operating groups. And lastly, Technologies. The segment had revenue of $3 billion in the quarter down $158 million from the year ago quarter or 5%. Two-thirds of the decline was attributed to Mission Systems, largely related to their continuing struggle with a shortage of chips which continues to plague their ability to deliver certain products. On the other hand, operating earnings of $304 million were down only $4 million or 1.3% on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margin to 10.1%. EBITDA margin was an impressive 14.1% including state and local taxes which are a 50-basis point drag on that result. Operating performance at GDIT was particularly strong 140-basis points better than the year ago quarter. These are industry-leading margin figures. Technologies had a good order activity in the quarter with book-to-bill of 1 :1 and good order prospects on the horizon.  Mission Systems had nice orders for many of their product offerings, especially those impacted by the chip shortage. The IT pipeline remains healthy in most of our federal IT lines of business as the government continues to modernize and upgrade its mission support systems. GDIT has the opportunity to submit $35 billion in opportunities this year including $17 billion in the third quarter, most of which represents new work.  That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for further remarks and then I'll provide our updated guidance. Bill Moss : Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Starting with cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first six months of the year. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract, which continues to receive payments as scheduled according to the contract restructure that occurred in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. The strong performance so far reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. And of course, as a reminder that outlook assumes current law with respect to the tax treatment of research and development expenditures. If the Congress acts to defer or reverse the current capitalization requirement we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment capital expenditures were $224 million in the quarter or 2.4% of sales. That's up from last year consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first six months we're closer to 2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target. We also paid $349 million in dividends and spent approximately $800 million on the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 4.9 million shares for just shy of $1.1 billion. The net result at the end of the second quarter was a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down more than $2 billion from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $95 million, down from $109 million in the second quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $193 million down from $232 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 17% bringing the rate for the first half to 15.6%, so no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But of course that implies a rate in the mid-16% range for the second half of the year, to arrive at that outcome. To shape that for you, we expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Jason mentioned, order activity in Aerospace led the way with a two times book-to-bill, which is the fifth consecutive quarter the book-to-bill for the group has been 1.6 times or higher. As a result Aerospace backlog is up over $5 billion in the past year, an increase of almost 40%. During the quarter, we finalized negotiations on the restructure of the last of our arrangements with a fractional aircraft operator, which resulted in a roughly $300 million reduction in the Aerospace backlog and a $900 million reduction in aircraft options. This action essentially clears our backlog of any exposure to fractional customers and has no impact on our production and revenue forecast for 2022 and beyond. On the Defense side, Combat Systems and Technologies also had solid quarters with a 1.4 times and a one times book-to-bill respectively. The increase in the Combat Systems backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of over $200 million in the quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combat's revenue by $65 million in the first half of the year as the euro fell to near parity with the dollar. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion while total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $126 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Jason to give you an update on our guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks. Jason Aiken : Thanks, Bill. Let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to this that will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9% which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. This will result in additional operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can deliver out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems should be on the low end of our revenue range with an improvement of up to 50 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of around $7.1 billion and operating margin around 15%. There's no change to Marine Systems revenue, but 30 basis points lower margin. So annual revenue of $10.8 billion with an operating margin around 8.3%, for the reasons I have previously described to you. Technologies revenue will be in the middle of the forecast revenue range at the same operating margin driven by GDIT with 3.5% year-over-year growth. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of around $12.9 billion with an operating margin around 10%. So, on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue at the higher end of our initial guidance and an overall operating margin around 10.8%, which is unchanged. This rolls up to EPS at the high end of our previous guidance range. In short, we expect only modest deviation from our initial guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be pleased to take your questions. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead when you ready, Robert. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard : Jason, I'll kick it off with one for you. The big question we've been getting from folks is what the impact could be on business jet and the Aerospace division from a slowdown in the global economy. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how this could play out and how aerospace is differently positioned from where it was say in 2007 2008? Jason Aiken : Yes. So, I think the most important point here, Rob, is the robust nature of the demand we've seen up to this point, the order activity that's resulted in the extended backlog that that provides us. Not to mention frankly -- and Bill spoke to this a little bit in terms of some of the cleanup in the quarter, but the durability of the backlog that continues to just increase the quality of that order book as we move forward. So, obviously, we can't predict when and what any type of slowdown will look like. There's a lot of talk out in the market about interest rates, inflation, the stock market recession potential and so on. But to be completely frank with you, we have not yet seen any impact of that in terms of our order pipeline and the resulting order activity that we've seen. There continues to be a very strong customer demand. We're continuing to see that as we embark here into the third quarter. And so I think bottom line between the size of the backlog, the ongoing order activity the durability of that backlog, which at this point is in excess of 2.5 times our annual sales for the group. Notwithstanding, the possibility of economic slowdown or similar conditions, we remain very confident and steadfast in our outlook for the next couple of years that we provided in terms of 2023, 2024 and beyond. Robert Stallard : Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the AJAX program in the Combat Systems division. Could you give us an update of what the situation is there and how it's to pan out from here? Thank you. Jason Aiken : Sure. So the program is proceeding. The vehicle tests are continuing and they continue to confirm frankly the vehicle performance that we've seen to date. With respect to some of the things that the customer has been focused on when it comes to vibration in the vehicle, some concerns that emerged in some of the early customer trials have been addressed at this point. And we are working right now on -- with the customer on securing appropriate communications gear. So I think the key here at this point is that this is going to really be all about how soon approvals can move through the system as we undergo this series of deliberate tests that take time as would be the case on any new platform development program. Frankly this is not inconsistent with experience that we would expect on any new platform development. But like I said we continue to work with the customer and they continue to assure us of their commitment to the program as well as of their need for this transformational capability. So it's an ongoing path forward, continuing to make progress and we expect to see ourselves to the other side of this testing and trials period soon enough and onward and upward with the program. Operator : Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning Seth. Seth Seifman : Good morning. Just to start off, I'm sure you've gotten this question a bunch of times but with regard to moving forward on G500 and 600 and the landing restriction, it sounds like you're still on track to have that lifted this quarter. And just any color you can give on what gives you the confidence there given that the Gulfstream, I think has done all its work but you're dependent on the FAA to do their work? Jason Aiken : No you kind of summed it up nicely there Seth. The fact is we have the software fix for this issue completed. It's been developed. It has been tested. It has been flown. And so we have great confidence in the efficacy of that software fix. And we are currently working with the FAA Gulfstream and the FAA working concurrently toward the initiative to get this airworthiness directive resolved. The program plan for that is to complete by or before mid-September. To your point, we are in part dependent on the resources of the FAA to make that happen. But they have been very good about this. They are committing the resources that we think are necessary and the teams are working together. And right now, everything seems to be right on track for a resolution of this, by the end of the third quarter. Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up still in Aerospace. This might be kind of a crude measure, but just looking at the revenue per aircraft in the quarter, it looks pretty strong. But obviously, we don't necessarily have all the information about mix and price and stuff like that. Can you tell us what the service growth was to help us hone in on that? And then, you mentioned a fractional settlement. Did that have any impact on the revenue in the quarter or any other backlog mechanics? Did those affect revenue? Jason Aiken : Yes. So, on the service side, we did see very strong growth in the quarter. That's continuing a trend that we've seen, since we've been emerging from the pandemic, both including sort of flight hour ramp-up as activity and flight activity picks up around the world, as well as FBO activity at our Jet Aviation business, particularly on the US side. So I think we had somewhere in excess of 35% growth year-over-year in the quarter, in service activity. And it's frankly that service activity that is driving the upside to the revenue and the outlook for the Aerospace group for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're still expecting our 123 aircraft deliveries for the year. So, a couple of hundred million dollars of additional revenue for the year is coming from that service side of the business. And I know you referenced, the cleanup we mentioned the backlog, but I sort of missed the latter part of your question. Do you mind repeating what you were getting at there? I'm sorry, Seth. He has already dropped off the line. Perhaps, you were getting at, whether any of the cleanup in the backlog has affected any of the revenue or other aspects of the Aerospace outlook. And the fact is, no, we're in good shape there. The cleanup as I mentioned or I think as Bill mentioned in the remarks was related to an ongoing negotiation we had with our really last sizable fractional customer in that backlog, and we've come to a settlement with that customer, removed some of the airplanes and expired some of the options there. And none of that activity has any impact on the outlook for the business. So all forecasts remain intact. Seth Seifman : Great. Thank you. Jason Aiken : Operator, hope we have our next question on. Operator : We now have our next question from David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open, David. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Jason, when we were down at Gulfstream back in June, I think you talked -- Gulfstream talked about being about 70% of the way through the software validation test on the 700. Can you just give us an update exactly where that stands today? Jason Aiken : Yes. I don't have an exact number on the update of 70%. Obviously, the progress on that software validation has been slowed somewhat by the fact that we've had to divert common resources in terms of those flight sciences engineers over to the fix on the 500 and 600. So that, as I mentioned before is really what's sort of affirming our risk on the slip of the 700 entry into service. So there's been some modest progress there, but call it in that 70-plus percent range remains where we are at this point. As soon as we get through that airworthiness directive resolution, we'll get those resources back on that program and moving forward to that updated EIS date. David Strauss : Okay. And as a follow-up, can you update us on supply chain? Any constraints you're kind of seeing on the Gulfstream side of things? I think when we were down there it was discussed about some shortages on the engine side. How do you feel about the overall supply chain at Gulfstream and your ability to hit that 123 delivery number for the full year? Jason Aiken : Yes. So as you referenced supply chain is definitely -- not to sugar coat it, it's an ongoing issue for the industry. It's no surprise or no secret that I think the commercial aerospace industry has had a fragile supply chain even before COVID hit. So it's probably no surprise that that's only been exacerbated. And I'd say, it's a daily battle. But that said I think there's no team that I'd rather have tackled this issue than the Gulfstream team down there. They have people embedded throughout the supply chain actively managing these issues with our partners to help them meet our commitments to our customers. And so I think while there can be issues from supplier-to-supplier and it's an active management activity that's going on. It's important to consider the impact of any part or subsystem or so on to the overall tack time of the airplane production process and ultimately the delivery schedule. So just because, let's say, a particular part may be missing its due on dock date doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to impact overall completion of the airplane or delivery of the customer between workaround that our team has and other efforts to keep the overall aircraft flow moving we don't see any impact to the delivery outlook that we have for the year. Obviously, these types of activities aren't optimal. We want to get this corrected frankly for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. But we continue to have great confidence in the team at Gulfstream to get through the challenge and they'll meet their aircraft delivery forecast for the year. David Strauss : Thanks very much. Jason Aiken : Sure. Operator : Thank you for that. We now have the next question from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready, Ron. Ron Epstein : Yes. Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone. Jason Aiken : Good morning, Ron. Ron Epstein : Question for you on again kind of maybe going back to the supply chain, but focusing a little bit more on Defense. So it seems like at Gulfstream, you guys are managing the constraints well. We've heard from some of the engine producers that castings and forgings and things are tight and you're managing through that. But it seems like you've got a lot more flexibility in your commercial business than you do in your defense business. And one of the themes that seems to have emerged from this quarter is that because of the way defense contracting is done we continue to hear shortages of A, B and C. Is there anything you guys can do about chip shortages buying inventory ahead, or are you just so constrained by the kind of the materials management acquisition rules that you can't do that? Because it seems like defense is just sort of fundamentally this sort of just-in-time business, but we're in sort of a just-in-case world if you get the gist of the question. Jason Aiken : Yes. No, it's a great question Ron and I'll kind of break that down into two aspects of our business sort of the short-term side and the long-term side. And the piece that we're seeing a bigger issue in on the short-term side and you referred to the chip shortage it's really that the Mission Systems piece that we've talked about for some time now. And again that's because these are quick turn orders. They're product-driven. They're dependent on these chips and you got to get them out the door. And obviously these are highly engineered high-end design engineering type products. So to your point the specifications are quite specific. That said, number one, I think the team is doing a tremendous job trying to develop work around. They are out there ordering parts in advance where they can. It's tough to get your spot in line because this is an issue affecting not just the industry, but the broader economy, but they're doing their best they can on that front. They are also working to change designs, modify designs, accept alternate parts where they can and be as nimble as they can on that front, but that obviously takes some time. I think importantly for that side of the business, this is just a timing issue we've seen here. If you take for example the second quarter and the product it wasn't able to ship at the end of the quarter, we've seen the vast majority of that actually get shipped in the first month of the third quarter. So that is flowing through. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. I think this is going to be something that's going to bug us for the balance of the year and maybe spill over a little into next year. But the fact is we've seen some of the strongest order activity from the customer in this area. So I think this is just a timing thing. We'll come through it and the order demand is there so that this will continue on into the balance of this year and beyond. So that's sort of on the short-term side of the business. The other big supply chain side that we're seeing frankly is a little bit different. It's on frankly the longest \u2013 longest leg side of the business and that's in the shipbuilding side. And really there it's less about parts or material availability. It's about the availability of labor the price and availability of skilled labor. And so we're seeing that really hit the supply chain for us. And for us it's focused primarily on the Virginia Class program. When you think of NASCO out on the West Coast and frankly the Columbia program at Electric Boat those are all hitting this in stride. But on the Virginia program, the supply chain has stumbled a little bit more. And when you think about it we have been working hard even prior to COVID to ramp-up our resources on those programs to support two per year Virginia as well as the addition of Columbia. And we were making pretty good headwind on that. And then COVID hits and you take two steps back instead -- or at least a pause instead of needing to take two steps forward. So when you think about shipbuilding and the nature of that business -- a shock like that to the system can hit it quickly, but it just takes time for it to recover. And so that's what we're seeing on the Virginia program as the supply chain is struggling to catch back up and, sort of, hit that cadence that they need to be on. But again like Gulfstream like Mission Systems Electric Boat has got all the resources that we can bring to bear and all the sense of urgency to apply to that supply chain. And once we can get that schedule right I think we'll be back on track. But in the meantime that schedule extension brings cost and that cost brings an impact to margins and that's what's affecting our outlook for that business. So that's -- I'm trying to give you a complete answer as I can on the supply chain as it hits the defense side. So that's sort of both into the spectrum from my perspective. Ron Epstein : Yes. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on combat. With all the awards that have been coming in and the activity in Europe when would you expect that to flow through the business? Is that a 2023 kind of thing? When would we expect to see that kind of -- at least on the top line? Jason Aiken : Yes, good question. I want to take a step back and maybe give a little clarity on what we've seen through the first half of this year and then what that means for where we're going. Obviously in the first half of the year we're down notionally a little bit more than you would expect given our full year outlook. I think we're about 10% down year-to-date. If you do some quick checking you'll see that what that's really a function of it that last year, our revenue per quarter was essentially consistent throughout the year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, which is really in contrast to the tried and true annual cycle that we see in Combat Systems and we're frankly once again seeing this year which is a sequential ladder, if you will, lowest in the first quarter, rising to the fourth quarter. So, that created a little unusual headwind in terms of the year-over-year comparisons. But we're still -- based on the way the second half plays out, still expecting to be at the low end of our revenue forecast. So, what does that imply? That implies about a 3.5% growth in the second half versus the second half of last year and I think that's imminently achievable by that group. But looking beyond that to your point, there's a tremendous amount of activity in this market. Obviously, as I mentioned before, the MPF award is a big one for us. That's a whole new additive space in the infantry brigade combat structure there. And there's tremendous demand signals internationally as you mentioned. Obviously, we're working toward the tank opportunity in Poland. There's other international tank opportunities as I mentioned before. And then you alluded to sort of demand generally internationally and everybody has kind of the suspicion that everything going on in Eastern Europe is going to lead to significant growth for the -- on the defense side. And certainly we are seeing those demand signals. I think the key thing that we all have to keep in mind here is to keep and check our expectations with respect to timing. The demand signals are there. We are having regular dialogue and ongoing conversation with those customers about that interest. But it just takes time for interest to turn into budgets to turn it into appropriations to turn into contracts to turn into revenue. So, I think it's all consistent with our long-term outlook that by 2024 and beyond we ought to see a nice uptick trajectory in Combat Systems. We're still talking low to mid-single-digit growth, but we ought to see an inflection point to growth out in that period and all of that is supportive of this. But in the meantime I'd just reiterate our emphasis that the focus and the story for Combat Systems is a margin one. And you've seen how well once again this group can perform on the margin side and be a really good cyclical no matter what's happening on the topline. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research. Your line is open Robert. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Jason I just want to go back to labor and talk across all the businesses where you stand where -- obviously, you said shipbuilding is a tough one. So, maybe that's the most challenging area. But when you look across the business, what is the labor and talent acquisition situation? Jason Aiken : Yes, you touched on it Rob. The shipbuilding side has been the toughest one. We've seen that in Maine. We've seen that all over sort of the New England shipyards as we've tried to ramp up. And frankly those are the two shipyards at EB and Bath that we have the most opportunity to ramp up. And so you got -- it's not like a lot of other industries where you're hearing things about remote work the ability to pull people from all over the country and all over the world. You've got to get shipbuilders in those states and in those regions to do that work and so that's what presents the challenge. The good news is we -- as I mentioned well before COVID, we had been ramping up and anticipating ramp-up. And so we've had a lot of resources put in place as well as great partnerships at the state and local levels to get the kind of trade schools and apprenticeships and so on to make that happen. So, I think the resources are in place. We've just got to keep our flow moving through those processes, keep our training capabilities up and running, and we can catch back up with this. It's just going to take time. And again that's just sort of the nature of shipbuilding and it's a challenge that those teams are up to. When you look on the other end of the spectrum, I think it's all about GDIT. And obviously, they are in a hypercompetitive market for hyper-skilled talent, and that only gets more competitive all the time. I think the leading positions they have in their markets, the strong culture they have and continue to build with that workforce and the opportunities that they provide their workforce within the company, continue to I think put them in a good position to compete and keep and grow that talent, it's -- I'm not going to sugarcoat it though, it's a war for talent every day. And we just -- it's our job to keep up with that and punch above our weight, and continue to retain and draw in the kind of talent they need to do that work and as that business grows. So those are kind of the two ends, of the spectrum. I think the other area, that we monitor it closely, is at Gulfstream. Obviously, with the growth they have you need people to do that. I think, not to underestimate the challenge that they have, but I think they've done a really good job of keeping up with it and I don't see that as being as high a nail, an item for Gulfstream in the moment. There's nothing that we can take our eye off the ball, and they've got to keep at it, but I think they're up to that challenge as well. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, going specifically to Electric Boat and the focus on getting Columbia ramped up and the labor situation, you just talked about there. Have we seen any work packages moved between Electric Boat and Newport News, in order to manage volumes and address labor shortages either for you or for them? Jason Aiken : So, Rob, I hate to give you this answer, but that's the kind of thing I don't think, I should probably get into too great a detail. We obviously, work very closely with them as our teaming partner on Virginia, as well as our subcontractor on Columbia. It's a three-part conversation between us, Newport and the Navy, to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support that customer and the growth that they need. And I think, that's the most important message is we're going to do everything we can, to support that customer and we're working together as a team to do that. And both sides, I think have a mutuality around that that's very important and very supportive. So... Robert Spingarn : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Jason Aiken : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We now have the next question on the phone line from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready. Doug Harned : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Jason Aiken : Good morning, Doug Doug Harned : Good morning. I wanted to see, if you could give us a little bit of a picture on the mix of Gulfstream orders. And in particular the G650, has extended longer than I think you all, first expected strong demand. Can you give us a sense of, what the mix is and then also, how you're looking at G650 production over time? Jason Aiken : Yes, you're absolutely, right. The G650 order activity continues to be robust, frankly, beyond even what we I think perhaps conservatively expected. I think we've said, a couple of times now in the past and it continues to be the case that the announcement of the G700 and the G800 have absolutely for our market and our customers clarified, where we are with this family of aircraft. And it clarifies, what the 650 is in terms of an opportunity for those customers. So that airplane, I think, continues to have legs to it. To make no mistake about it, the 800 is the replacement for the 650. And as the 800 comes into service, we will work the 650 out. There may be some modest overlap as we feather in from one to the other. But I think, what this outsized demand on the 650 does is it gives us a lot of optionality. It gives us opportunity, if this demand environment continues. With respect to our outlook for 2023 and 2024, we'll have to see how that plays out. It's also giving us the optionality, to deal with some of these issues, we've talked about with the certification process. As the 700 slips, we're not backtracking on our commitments to the delivery units, the revenue and the earnings forecast that we've given for 2022, 2023 and 2024. And frankly the 650 demand is helping with that, as well as the demand environment in general. And to that point, you kind of asked about the whole portfolio. And I think there's some question and speculation out there among the community about the airworthiness directive and what that might mean for the 500 and 600. And I'd tell you again, we delivered the vast majority of the airplanes that we intended to this quarter. We expect that to be resolved by the end of the third quarter. And when you look at the order activity in the second quarter, I think, the 500 and 600 represented about half the order activity that we had. So there's no signs of slowing down there. Our customers understand what this little bump in the road is and so, those platforms continue to be very well supported. So across the board -- and I didn't even mention the G280, that continues to have great order demand. I think the mid-cabin space has really picked up in the aftermath of COVID. So really across the board, in the portfolio, we see broad-based demand for our airplanes. Doug Harned : Well -- and then just as a follow-up, switching over to Technologies, I mean, I know there's been -- you've had challenges with award protests and so, there have been some difficulties. But this is something where we've been looking for growth for a long time. And if you look out over the next few years, I mean, how are you thinking about Technologies in terms of a growth trajectory? Because we just haven't really seen it yet. Jason Aiken : So, obviously, this is a conversation we've been in for some time now. And I think if you look back, we had low single-digit growth last year. We're expecting modestly better growth this year. And as I reiterated earlier our updated outlook for the year is spot on in the middle of our revenue forecast range we gave back in January. Obviously, we're off to a little bit of a slower start to the year, but I'd say a little bit of a slower start and that's largely attributable to Mission Systems. I won't reiterate those issues, but we do believe that that is a timing issue for us. GDIT is flat for the first half, but we absolutely have a clear line of sight to growth for them in the second half. And so, look, I mean, what gives us confidence in this outlook? I think, the way we look at it is not any one particular win or loss or one program or another. It's really about all of the key, what I think about as, leading indicator data or statistics that are around a business that is made up of thousands of contracts across the portfolio. You're talking about order activity, win and capture rates on new as well as recompete business, book-to-bill, backlog, potential contract value, so on and so forth. And all of those metrics for us continue to support an outlook for this business of low to mid-single-digit growth. And when you look at GDIT, for example, they had awards in the first half that were valued at about $7 billion. And that's significantly higher than the first half of last year and the vast majority of that represents new work. So, obviously, this can be frustrating, I think, for you all. And sometimes it is for us, given the particularly lumpy aspect of this business when it comes to the protest and delayed award adjudication process. So it can come in fits and starts. But we remain bullish on this and we think bottom line, we're talking about a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook. And frankly, as I think about it, you may have noticed a couple of weeks after the quarter, we had the announcement of the Air Force European support contracts some $900-plus million opportunity. If that had happened a couple of weeks earlier, it would be kind of a completely different conversation around the book-to-bill for the Technologies group in the quarter. So that's just a one-off example, but it speaks to the point that, while timing can be frustrating and lumpy and the pipeline can be a challenge to get through, it doesn't change our long-term outlook for this business. Operator : Thank you. We now have Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead, when you are ready, Peter. Peter Arment : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Jason. Jason Aiken : Good morning. Peter Arment : Maybe we can get just your updated thoughts on -- we've seen the markups from defense budget working their way through the Senate and House. How is that impacting some of your defense business? And obviously I mean there's been a focus on combat and technology so kind of returning to growth. And just kind of any color you can provide there that would be helpful. Jason Aiken : Yeah. I think the two things that I'd point out. It's obviously still very early in that process. But bottom-line as you'd expect shipbuilding remains extremely well supported. You can see the numbers there. And so that I think just continues to be supportive of our -- an underpinning of our outlook for the ongoing $400 million to $500 million a year growth in the Marine Systems business, so all positive there. I think the greater area of maybe anxiety or speculation is around Combat Systems and the Army budgets. We'll see where that goes. This is obviously something that ebbs and flows and has a lot higher beta in terms of an Army budget on an annual basis than on the Navy strategic side. But the fact is we can't ignore the fact that there is a significant amount of support among the Congress for increasing defense budgets. So Abrams, Stryker those continue to be very critical assets in the Army infrastructure and we think there's continued support for those. And so while there's a lot of chatter around it those are going to decline and what's going to happen. Let's just see how it plays out. I think we'll have to stay tuned and see. Peter Arment : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up. Your thoughts on just any impact if we have a continuing resolution, obviously this is not -- you guys have managed through a lot of continuing resolutions. So, just thoughts on any impact there? Jason Aiken : Yeah. I don't see any real high anxiety in the moment. It's obviously something to your point that we've learned to work with and work around. It's certainly not desirable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's almost become part of our annual reality. I think until these things get into a six-seven-month-plus type of situation that's when it really starts to affect our shorter-cycle business on the technology side, perhaps in the ammunition side. But beyond that we really don't see a significant impact at this point. Again, it's unfortunate. We don't like it but we've learned to try to operate around it. Operator : Thank you. We would now like to have the next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead, when you are ready. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning guys. Thank you for the time Jason and Howard. Jason Aiken : Yeah, morning Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. I wanted to maybe ask a shorter-term question to follow-up on Doug's on Technologies. It was down 3% in the first half and up 10% growth in the second half implied with the guidance. GDIT seems to be doing well like fairly flat. Can you maybe bridge us on mission? And how you think about supply chain getting back growing in the second half timing of funding because a lot of the GDIT peers have complained about that, maybe if you could just bridge us shorter term. Jason Aiken : Yeah. You've touched on the key issues, but I think the biggest piece of it is what I mentioned before is that we're already seeing here in the third quarter our ability to catch back up on some of that delayed product shipment from the second quarter. We really got that balled up there toward the end of the second quarter and that hampered the revenue for the first half. But we -- look, I don't want to sugarcoat the challenge is Mission Systems is not out of the woods. So they're going to fight and scrap their way, but they're seeing their way toward workarounds on that supply chain side. And I have a good deal of confidence that they can get there. On the GDIT side, it is a frustrating environment in terms of the slow pace of the outlays. Frankly, we've seen that a bit on both the Mission Systems and GDIT side. But I think the hill that they have to climb in the second half is not as high. And I think we've got reasonable line of sight in terms of the work that's in the books and they just got to go execute on that should get them there in the second half. They've just got a little bit of go to get in the second half. So I feel even greater confidence on the GDIT side. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask a cleanup on aerospace. When we think about the 123 delivery side, how much of that includes G700s? And then given the raise was on service how much of the services business is in the backlog? Jason Aiken : So I don't necessarily get into detailed order \u2013 backlog and ordering cancellations on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. I apologize I'm going to have to punt on that one. But on the service side, we typically don't have much in the way of service activity in the backlog. We have a very modest amount in the aerospace unfunded backlog category that is related to longer-term maintenance arrangements that we have with some larger customers. But the service activity across the board at Jet Aviation and Gulfstream is really a book-and-bill basis on a quarterly and annual basis so sort of a one-to-one typically there. Howard Rubel : Operator, we will just take one more question. Operator : Thank you. We have the last question from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So orders at Gulfstream for aircraft you mentioned about half in the quarter was for the 500, 600. You mentioned that the 650 is doing well. How is the 800? Because that's been introduced relatively lately. You now have a new competitor in the market that looks like they match you in range with four versus three sections. So how is the 800 doing? Jason Aiken : Yes. The demand for that aircraft is quite solid Cai. It's doing well every quarter. Booking orders I think between the fact that the 650 is still taking orders and the fact that the EIS for the 800 is still a good ways out, we're not expecting a massive surge in orders. As we start to move closer to that transition, you might expect it to pick up and shift more from the 650 to the 800. But right now I'd tell you it's just good solid order activity that is very much supportive of our EIS timing and our expectations for that airplane. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. And could you \u2013 could give us a little bit more color in terms of the order potential for combat? You mentioned Europe is strong. You mentioned Abrams. How about the rest of your vehicles? How about the munitions business? Jason Aiken : So the rest of the vehicles you have to think about our European Land Systems business. They have an extremely large installed base of wheeled and tracked combat vehicles that on the one hand have a replacement cycle with them that offers some opportunity in the out years, as well as it provides incentive for those who are trying to bring up their level of defense spending to do so in a way that aligns with their allies. And if their allies are operating and fighting one particular platform or another, that's an incentive for those who are starting to spend up more to achieve commonality with those allies. So we think that puts us in good stead for these opportunities that are coming out of threats in Europe. Across the board, though to be a little more specific, a lot of this stuff is either in the backlog or on the horizon when you think about the Spanish 8x8 vehicle. You've got again the potential \u2013 or the \u2013 I shouldn't say the potential, the impending order for tanks out of Poland. We're talking with Romania, Switzerland all of those are sort of bread and butter countries are all looking at increased spending on a variety of platforms. So that plus just sort of this, again, generic increased level of indicated interest across Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, I think it provides tremendous potential opportunity. It's just too early to try and count any of that and anticipate exactly when or what that looks like. Timing in Europe often can be a challenge. So it would probably be a bit of a fool's errand for me to try and get too specific around that. But we do see a good robust environment as supportive of combat. Cai von Rumohr : Thanks, again. Jason Aiken : You\u2019re welcome. Howard Rubel : And Brica, operator, I think we are done with the question-and-answer period. And I thank everybody for joining the call today.

Please note, that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Howard, please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share and revenue of $10 billion. Operating earnings of $1.1 billion and net earnings of $902 million. Revenue is up, $407 million or 4.3% against the third quarter last year.  Operating earnings are up $18 million or 1.7%. Net earnings are up 4.9% and earnings per share are up 6.2%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare favorably.  The sequential results are even better. Here we beat last quarter's revenue by 8.6%, operating earnings by 12.3%, net earnings by 17.8% and EPS by 18.5%. We beat consensus by $0.11 per share on somewhat higher revenue than anticipated by the sell side. Operating margin is about as anticipated. Most of the beat came from various other items including a lower tax rate than anticipated by the sell side.  On a year-to-date basis, net earnings are up $93 million or 4% and earnings per share are up $0.45 a strong 5.5%. We also had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective, net cash flow provided by operating activities is $1,280 billion. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion, a 114% of net income.  This follows a very strong cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter across all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream. You will hear more detail on cash and backlog from Jason a little later.  In summary, we enjoyed a strong quarter particularly so unlighted supply chain foreign exchange and inflation headwinds. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments. First Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2,350 billion and operating earnings of $312 million with a 13.3% operating margin.  Revenue is $281 million more than a year ago quarter up 13.6%. Operating earnings up $50 million more, up 19.1% on higher revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in margins. The sequential improvement is even better, revenue is up $480 million or 25.7% and operating earnings are up $74 million or 31.1%.  To be fair, the prior quarters revenue and earnings were somewhat lower as a result of the inability to deliver for Aircraft, due the airworthiness directive, which was fully resolved in the third quarter. From an audit perspective, this was yet another good quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. The Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.15:1, Gulfstream Aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 and 1.9:1 year-to-date.  The first point and perspective since the end of the third quarter of 2021, Aerospace total backlog has grown $4,362 billion, to reach a very robust $19.1 billion. Despite apparent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to experience a strong level of interest, good activity and a replenishing pipeline, Certainly, demand in the quarter was not as super-heated as prior quarters, but still the book-to-bill was very good against a significant increase in deliveries. Only time will tell about the macroeconomic impact, but we continue to see strong interest in Gulfstream aircraft and services. From a product perspective, the G500 and G600 of now seen FAA removed the wind-related airworthiness directive right on the schedule we had previously forecast. Almost the entire fleet had received the installation of the upgraded software by the end of the quarter. We have delivered 188 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter. The G500, G600 together led the quarter in orders follow closely by G650. This is a very successful program with real market momentum. With respect to G700 development, the control law software validation is scheduled to begin FAA-type inspection authorization during the first week of November. We estimate we will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FAA resources. Gulfstream had 35 deliveries in the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we'll deliver 40 to 41 aircraft in the fourth quarter. I haven't said much about Jet Aviation, but suffice it to say, it performed well in the quarter with improving margins in its MRO activities. In short, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and should have an even stronger fourth quarter. Next, Combat. Combat Systems had very similar results on a quarter over year ago quarter basis, but with strong improvement sequentially. The Combat Systems revenue of $1.790 billion is up 2.5% from the year ago quarter. earnings are down 1.8% on a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Nevertheless, the operating margin in the quarter is an impressive 15.2%.  On a sequential basis, Combat Systems revenue is up $122 million or 7.3%, while operating earnings are up a very significant 10.6% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin. Demand across the segment provided a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 with a large order for Abrams main battle tanks for Poland, orders for $370 million for munitions and ordinance, and in order for 39 labs from the Canadian government.  We also received our first order related to the Ukraine at our munitions business. All of this increases the Combat Systems total backlog to $13.8 billion. In summary, this was an impressive new business quarter with strong operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group. Next, Marine. Revenue of $2.8 billion is up $132 million, 5% over the year ago quarter. This quarter's revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly between electric boat and NASCO. Revenue is also up $118 million or 4.5% sequentially. Year-to-date revenue is up $415 million or 5.4%. Revenue in this group has been up for the last 20 quarters on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This is very impressive continued consistent growth. Operating earnings are $238 million in the quarter, up $9 million or 3.9% on operating margins of 8.6%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are $27 million or an impressive 12.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. At Electric Boat, the Columbia first ship remains on cost and on contract schedule. The ship is more than 25% complete. NASCO had a particularly good quarter with improved TAO revenue and better margins across the board. From an orders perspective, Electric Boat received a large maintenance and modernization order for the USS Hartford. NASCO received orders for an additional ESB and 2 TAO oilers. As a result, book-to-bill was 1.1:1, leading to a $400 million increase in backlog. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '23 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. And as I've said before, the real opportunity given the steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time. Moving to Technologies. This segment has revenue of $3.71 billion in the quarter, down $49 million from the year ago quarter or 1.6%. The revenue decrease was fairly evenly split in dollar terms between Mission Systems and IT. Mission Systems suffered from nagging supply chain disruptions and the failure of some government customers to obligate funds for authorized and appropriated products. In the case of IT services, it was largely timing and program mix. Operating earnings of $285 million are down $42 million or 12.8% on a 120 basis point reduction in operating margin, exclusively attributed to Mission Systems and largely related to the issues impacting revenue. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparative periods with a book-to-bill of 1 :1 in good order prospects on the horizon. The pipeline remains very active at both businesses.  GDIT enjoyed another solid operating quarter with healthy earnings and particularly strong cash in part due to good results in the federal civilian division. While we continue to see procurement delays, GDIT's year-to-date wins exceeded full year 2021 awards in dollar terms. These wins highlight the nice momentum in the business as GDIT begins to realize the benefits from targeted investments in the technical differentiation of its offerings. And this, despite the more than $3.5 billion tied up in prolonged protest and nearly $17 billion pending adjudication at the end of the third quarter. On the people front, GDIT remains focused on attracting and retaining the very best technology talent. The culture of this business has created. One of empowerment, accountability and inclusivity is a clear differentiator and a fiercely competitive talent market. Mission Systems experienced a series of challenges in the third quarter, additional supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor availability and select intel programs and customer contracting delays. Many mission system customers have a serious shortage of contracting officers that have hampered their ability to execute on programs of record. In addition, quite understandably, customer focus has been redirected in some areas to meet the more urgent demands of the Ukraine. The business has offset some of the bottom line impact by productivity improvements and cost-cutting initiatives. They will make every effort to catch up in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we anticipate these fact of life realities to continue for a while. I have more to say on that subject in a moment. That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter for the entire company. So as we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be largely in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call. As I just referenced, we expect technologies to fall short of our previous estimates, but we expect aerospace to run somewhat ahead of our previous forecast. All up, they should offset each other. In all other respects, our guidance remains the same. We stand by our previous EPS guidance. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Starting with our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream orders and particularly strong cash performance from our Technology segment. This brings us to $3.9 billion of operating cash flow through the first 9 months of the year, which also includes the ongoing collections on our large international combat vehicle contract according to the contract restructure that occurred back in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was just over $1 billion for the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 137% through the first 9 months. The continued strong performance positioned us very well to achieve our target for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. With respect to the status of the tax treatment of research and development expenses, I think everyone can sense that despite the broad-based bipartisan support for immediate expensing of these investments, the window of opportunity for action in 2022 is quickly closing. As we've said all throughout the year, if the Congress acts to defer or reverse the capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $255 million in the quarter or 2.6% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 9 months, we're at 2.2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target, so obviously an implied uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We also paid $345 million in dividends during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first 9 months to just over $2.1 billion. The net result at the end of the third quarter was a cash balance of $2.5 billion and a net debt position just under $9 billion, down over $1.5 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $86 million, down from $99 million in the third quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $279 million, down from $331 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.  The tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 15.1%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year, which, of course, implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. One more comment on the tax front. The inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August included a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We don't expect either of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial results. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As mentioned earlier, Aerospace continued to have a strong order activity with a 1.2 times book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6 times over the trailing 12 months. On the defense side, the combined book-to-bill was 1.1 times, with each of the segments achieving a book-to-bill of at least 1 times. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.8 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $125.8 billion. The increase in backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $275 million in the quarter and $650 million year-to-date, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combats revenue by $55 million in the quarter and $123 million in the first 9 months of the year due to the surging dollar versus the euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, the Combat Systems Group's revenue would have been up by 5.6% in the quarter and down only 3.9% for the first 9 months. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first telephone question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Seth, please go ahead, you may begin. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. Sorry, Jason, to waste a question on pension here, but you guys are a little bit different than your peer group in terms of the way that you account for things. When we think about where interest rates and asset returns are year-to-date and we think about the income below the line next year, where that might migrate to you. And when we think about the cash impact if any, in terms of the contributions that you would expect. Can you give us an update on that? Jason Aiken : Yes. As you said, Seth, we are somewhat different from most of the peer group in this regard. And as a result, right now, we're not expecting anything material from an income perspective on the pension front. Obviously, that's something we'll roll up as part of our full operating plan process here in the fourth quarter and give you more specific detailed guidance in January. But I think the bottom line is both from an earnings as well as from a cash perspective, we don't expect that at this point to be a material item. Seth Seifman : Okay. Just to clarify, the $40 million or so of income below the line each quarter, that kind of continues? Jason Aiken : Some version in that range. I don't have an exact number at this point. You can expect it to decline as you would modestly. But again, that's not 100% pension income there. It's a big piece of that is pension income on the commercial side of the business. So it should down take a little bit, but not in a material way. Seth Seifman : Okay. Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw some news during the quarter about the Australian sub and the potential to do some work on that outside of Australia. And we all kind of know about the capacity constraints on sub building right now. Maybe could you talk a little bit about your thinking on that topic? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we are driven entirely by the demand of our customer and the prioritization of our customers. So we're working with them, our U.S. Navy, to determine what the focus should be going forward. And as we work through these -- some of these capacity issues then how do we accommodate not only U.S. demand but potentially other demand. Seth Seifman : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question today comes from David Straus of Barclays. David, go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning. Phebe, were there any unusual costs at the Aerospace segment in the quarter related to the 500, 600 software fix? Jason Aiken : Yes, David, we did have, I think you're aware, some customer accommodation related to the software issue, both in the second quarter and the third quarter wasn't material to the results, but that has been absorbed in the numbers that you see and is inherent in the improved margins that the group posted in the quarter. David Strauss : Okay. And it's completely behind nothing lingering in Q4, Jason? Phebe Novakovic : Right. Jason Aiken : That's correct. It's behind us at this point. David Strauss : Okay. Great. And a follow-up on free cash flow conversion. Given where you are year-to-date, I mean over 100% for the full year looks pretty conservative unless there's something unusual, I guess, from a working capital perspective that you're expecting in or baking in in Q4. Can you just elaborate on that? Jason Aiken : Yes. As you point out, the cash flow has been particularly strong through the first 9 months. So as I said in the opening remarks, we're very comfortable with the 100-plus percent for the year. To be completely candid, there's probably some opportunity for some upside there. If I look at the things that we're monitoring, number one, to the first 9 months, we've had a significant benefit from working capital reduction. Some of that's timing. So some of that could turn in the fourth quarter. We'll watch that. The other big piece is, as I noted, we're still expecting or forecasting CapEx for the year to be in the 2.5% of sales range. So that implies a pretty meaningful uptick in CapEx in the fourth quarter. I'll acknowledge that often chased our CapEx forecast and rarely hit it. So there could be some upside opportunity there if we don't get everything in, in the year. But if we do that, that's a headwind to the fourth quarter. And frankly, the third item is something that everybody continues to monitor and that is we need to resolve our situation on the Ajax program. So those are some of the things we're monitoring for the fourth quarter. We come through all that. And certainly, to your point, we have some opportunity for some upside. David Strauss : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Ron, you may begin. Ron Epstein : Good morning. Just maybe the supply chain question. It seems like you guys are navigating it really well. Most airplane companies today are having aren't going to deliver more than they thought they were going to deliver the opposite problem. So I guess my question for you is how is the supply chain going for Gulfstream? And then b, when you look at the defense business you have, you heard kind of across the sector, similar issues on chips and so on and so forth. How is it going there? Phebe Novakovic : So we've had a fair number of supply chain challenges on the aerospace side, which we have accommodated heretofore. But supply chain remains a potential challenge going forward. And as we go through our planning process in the fourth quarter, we get a lot more clarity airplane by airplane of what the supply chain is able to do. But we have so far managed. There are, however, as you quite rightly note, a fair number of headwinds out there. On the defense side, we have accommodated most of the supply chain perturbations, except obviously in the Marine group. But most profoundly in the quarter and most impactfully is at Mission Systems. And while they had with a lot of the more pedestrian supply chain challenges, specialty chips continue to dog them and the additional delays that they experienced in the quarter were very, very hard for them, in fact, impossible for them to overcome. Mission Systems is a very high-performance organization, and they produced several high-value complex products that have experienced delays before, but again, even beyond some of the chip problems, some of the specialty products going into that production those production lines were also impacted. So the Mission System is credit. They have taken a lot of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives to offset the margin impact and earnings impact of the revenue decline, but we're going to have to work through some of that. And so more to come as we look into the fourth quarter and then into next year. Ron Epstein : Got it. Got it. And then maybe as a follow-on, on the labor side, what are you seeing across the businesses, right? We clearly hear from the Navy that they want to have more shipbuilders out there. But I mean what are you seeing across all the businesses you have in the portfolio in terms of skilled labor? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So there are some across the businesses, there are some specialty engineering and specialty fields that have had some headwinds on labor, but those are beginning to resolve in terms of manufacturing, we had some perturbation in -- we've had a lot of perturbation in the labor market, but felt that particularly at constant point, but that's beginning to resolve itself.  When you think about shipbuilding, shipbuilding is a very complex, high touch labor business. And when you have a nationwide perturbation in the labor market is going to be impacted. I mean while we kept open, not all of the supply chain did, but we also lost a number of experienced shipbuilders as well as experienced people manufacturing folks in the supply chain. So all of that at a higher level than we normally experience. And I don't think that we are alone in that. People took the opportunity in the middle of the pandemic to retire. So we've got to work through some of that. But ultimately, we do not see and I think this is an important point here. We do not see labor as constraint for our revenue growth at the moment. Certainly not in the longer term. Ron Epstein : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Rod Stallard of Vertical Research. Rod, please proceed. Robert Stallard : Good morning. Steve, your comments suggest that we're finally seeing some of this strong defense demand turning into orders. But what sort of time line are you expecting for these orders to actually convert into deliveries. Phebe Novakovic : You talking about combat? Robert Stallard : Well, across the defense divisions, but firstly, combat. Yes. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Let's talk about Combat because I think -- and then we can talk if you want a little bit about technologies. And before I get to combat, marine is pretty clear. The orders continue to be healthy. The revenue projection, while you have some quarterly lumpiness, it signifies nothing for the long-term growth.  With respect to combat, we saw a number of things in the quarter, primarily Stryker and Abrams as well as MPF is beginning to ramp up as in Poland. And we saw some munitions orders also related to the Ukraine. So I suspect that -- and if we parse through, we focus in on the Ukraine, what we anticipate that our U.S. Army customers telling us they want more ammunition and munitions. So we're working with them to ramp up production. In Europe, we've seen demand for bridges because frankly, a lot of water in Europe. And we've got a very nice business in Germany to provide river crossings at various widths and weight levels. And then we\u2019re seeing -- beginning to see increases in vehicle orders and vehicle RFPs coming out, particularly, but not exclusively in the former Eastern block. So technologies is really, I think, a tale of two cities. GDIT has had good bookings. They grew last year. We anticipate them to grow this year. This is all about Mission Systems, as I think, tried to give you a fair amount of detailed color on what's impacting them. The demand for their high-value products is out there. It's just our -- the inability to deliver because of the supply chain is constraining some of the orders, but they're there. They're just waiting to be executed once we get through all of this, and we will, we will get through it. Robert Stallard : So just to follow up on combat, and these orders you've had from Europe, for example, is there roughly a 12-month to 2-year lead time between the contract getting signed and actually GD delivering? Phebe Novakovic : Completely depends on the product. Less so on the bridge side and it depends and again, less so potentially on the vehicle side, it just depends on the vehicle, and exactly what modifications or changes folks want. We're not looking at clean sheet vehicles. We're looking at changes to existing vehicles that we have updated consistently and throughout the years. So it will depend. I suspect a year, in some cases, 18 months. Certainly, I don't expect a whole lot more than that. Robert Stallard : Yes, it was great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Myles, please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. I know that there's the $1 billion maturity coming in November, but curious maybe, Phebe, how you're thinking about capital deployment in a broader sense, obviously, cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. I think. Go ahead. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, yes. No, no, no. And that's a very good question. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. But let me give -- ask Jason to give you a little bit more color on the details. Jason Aiken : Yes. I think the way to think about it, Myles, we've talked about the $1 billion coming due in November. We do plan to pay that down. When you think on the debt side, we'll have additional maturities coming up in 2023, and that's where we said we'll start to look, think back to the CSRA acquisition and the additional debt we took on, we would bring it down to a point where it's some undefined point in the future, we'd start to think about whether we've hit the right level or not. And I think when we get into next year, we'll start to have that conversation in a more substantive way in terms of decision making. When you look at the other elements, share repurchase, as you know, is always tactical and opportunistic. It was a very volatile market in the third quarter. So we were a little more hands off just kind of trying to see what -- where things shake out, but that doesn't change our long-term approach to share repurchase in a tactical and opportunistic way. And I think importantly, the dividend is always going to be there. You've always heard us talk about that, and we'll continue to expect to be on that trajectory that we've been on for the past quarter century, frankly. So as Phebe said, no changes in the deployment strategy. It will just be a matter of what's in the moment in a given quarter. And I think importantly, our cash flow performance and our liquidity resources afford to see optionality to address all of those priorities without having to forgo one for the sake of the other. Myles Walton : And just a quick follow up, Phebe said, it\u2019s the M&A market attractiveness. Is that improved become worse the same? Phebe Novakovic : We're just not going to comment on M&A. So I think we can leave it at that. You want one more shot, one more question? Myles Walton : No. I'll stay through. I don't want to get Howard Angry. Phebe Novakovic : Yes, that's a scary thing, Isn't it? Operator : Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. George, go ahead. George Shapiro : Yes. Jason, I wonder if I could pin you down a little bit as to how big a number of the software fixes were in the margin for Gulfstream in the quarter. Are we talking a few million dollars or something more? Jason Aiken : George, I don't actually have a discrete number on the software fix. I mean, I have a sense of the overall R&D budget and that sort of fits into that context. So I think as David asked earlier in terms of impacts to aerospace in the quarter, you saw the nice margin improvement, frankly, even a little bit ahead of where we were expecting, which is why as Phebe alluded, we think we'll -- the group perform better for the full year. But even within those strong results in the quarter, we did have an impact, an adverse impact in terms of the accommodations we made with customers on the 500, 600 airworthiness directive. Again, that's fully behind us. And we are in a, at this point, sustained elevated R&D mode. Part of that was the resources that were diverted from the 700 over to the 500, 600 AD fix, and that will sustain through next year, as we've talked about as we continue towards certification of the 700 and then ultimately the 800. So I'll give you a little more color around that, but I apologize, I don't have a discrete number around the airworthiness directed fix. George Shapiro : Okay. And then a quick one, Phebe, a usual question. There's a $59 million difference between the gross and the net bookings in Aerospace. Was that a cancellation? Was it FX related? Or if you can quantify that? Phebe Novakovic : All of the above. I mean really absolutely immaterial. George Shapiro : Okay. And let me sneak in one last one. Phebe Novakovic : You're risking Howard's ire. Go, George. George Shapiro : I always got Howard's ire. That's okay. when you commented about your deliveries in '23 and '24, it presupposed the book-to-bill of 1. Obviously, we've run a lot better than that. So are you thinking of changing those delivery forecasts or just stay conservative with the delivery forecast that you have out there? Phebe Novakovic : Not at the moment. We assumed 1 :1, and at the moment, I don't see any reason to change that. But as we go through our planning process, to the extent that we need to modify it, we certainly will and we'll be very explicit about that in the fourth quarter. George Shapiro : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Phebe Novakovic : Kristine. Hello? Kristine Liwag : Sorry about that. You guys hear me. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Kristine Liwag : Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Phebe, on international defense sales, we're seeing changes in relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. With your foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia through Canada, how do we think about this evolving relationship potentially affecting your business? Phebe Novakovic : We see no indication of that in a moment. You want to ask one more. Kristine Liwag : Yes, following up on what George was asking about on aerospace. I mean book-to-bill was at 1times at aerospace. We've seen this above 2 times in the past few quarters. But at the same time, the backlog is at record levels. Can you provide some color on the demand resilience you're seeing? Is this a demand from corporate customers, individuals? And then also, is there some sort of level of backlog where you're comfortable at so not to extend the duration of when people have to wait for their aircraft. Any color you could provide there would be really helpful. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So we -- let's take your question in the inverter. We always watch the delivery times for our aircraft to our customers. And so far, that's all been manageable. Well, just to remind you, starting in mid-February of last year, we frankly entered the hottest in notranic demand market that I've ever seen. And the order level in the quarter was by any measure, spectacular.  So we've seen strong U.S. demand, Fortune 500 Mideast, Southeast Asia. And our demand interestingly, and I think not surprisingly, our pipeline going into the fourth quarter looks very much like the pipeline going into the third quarter. So at the moment, we've got some pretty good visibility of what orders look like. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen. Cai, please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much, and good results, Phebe. So how is the software accommodation split between the second and third quarter. And as we look going forward, with that out of the way, and presumably R&D flat to down and volume up, what should we look for about the margins in the fourth quarter and going forward? Phebe Novakovic : So we'll see some margin upside, which we alluded to or about stated rather, in our guidance for the year. But the software fixes work almost entirely done by the end of the second quarter and the financial issue, it's about 50-50. So we're -- we like where we are. And frankly, you haven't asked this, but let me just give you a little bit of transparency around that. The transparency of the engineering resources that -- and the cooperation between the FAA and the Gulfstream was very strong and very apparent throughout that process. So we expect that kind of relationship to continue. Jason Aiken : If I could add just 1 thing. Cai, there was a predicate in your question that R&D would be coming down, we don't yet expect R&D to be coming down. If you look through next year with the 700 and the 800 will remain at a sustained and potentially even elevated level next year. So I just want to make sure that point is also clear. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Good point. Cai von Rumohr : Excellent. And as a follow-up, if we turn to GDIT, you mentioned $3.5 billion in protest, $17 billion in bids awaiting. How does that compare with the second quarter? And given that they lifted the occupancy restrictions at DoD in the middle of September, have we seen a pickup in any of that flowing through to bookings? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, we have. But tell me again what the first part of your question was? Cai von Rumohr : Well, you had $17 billion in business awaiting at $3.5 billion in progress. Phebe Novakovic : Some of the protests have resolved to our favor. And these are -- when we say protest, these are items that we've won that have been protested. And we've got one in there that's got to be approaching the federal level of number of protests. So hopefully, we'll get through that in the fourth quarter. And I think there's -- it's down somewhat, as I said, because they've resolved. But we still see a fair amount of proposals in the decision-making cycle, which has, as we've said elongated. But even given that, GDIT continues to grow. Cai von Rumohr : Thank you, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC. Ken, proceed. Kenneth Herbert : Yes, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to first ask on the schedule for the 7 and the 800. Is it fair to assume that resources that were diverted from the 700 are now 100% back on that program? And in the last few months, considering issues, okay, great, considering issues on the 5 and 6 have been resolved. Are you seeing anything else from the FAA that could potentially put entry to service schedules at risk? Phebe Novakovic : So as I said, we've cooperated very well with the FAA. We expect that to continue. I would note that we learned a lot in that process of how to work through the new software requirements from the FAA. I think that, coupled with the fact that the G700 is the most mature aircraft to enter the FAA certification process as a result of its software system and considerable and successful testing that preceded FAA review. We see -- we're sticking with our at the moment with our summer 2023 estimate. But look, when we give you sort of our best guess on when the certification is. That's a result of a lot of things that we control and that we can talk about with certainty. But ultimately, this is an FAA issue, and it's the availability of their resources, and they are the regulator and they're going to control it. So we've always tried to be transparent about that, but recognize that the U.S. government controls ultimately the pace. Kenneth Herbert : Okay. Very helpful. And if I could, just 1 quick follow-up. On the defense side, how would you look at the risk of your business if for whatever reason, we have a continuing resolution that extends into calendar '23? Phebe Novakovic : At the moment, we don't see a particular risk. And if we get 3 to 4 quarters in the entire year of a CR, which I find in this threat environment, very difficult to imagine. And we'd have to come back at you. But nothing we hear would suggest that it's the desire of Congress to do that. Kenneth Herbert : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Doug, please go ahead. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. When you look at the demand you're seeing at Gulfstream right now, can you give us kind of a picture of how this looks? And what I mean is we're seeing a lot of things such as first-time customers going straight to large cabin jets, perhaps shifts in international versus U.S. Can you give us a picture of what that outlook is today for you? And has that changed some over the past couple of years? Phebe Novakovic : So I think you and I, a couple of years ago, had a discussion about structural versus cyclical change. And I still think it's premature to see any to declare that there's been a structural change. We've certainly seen some increase in first-time buyers, but that was in part because a lot of wealth was created during the pandemic. The higher the pandemic. So I don't have exact data about what's in the pipeline, but I can imagine that it will be much different than this quarter, which is heavy U.S. Fortune 500, again, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Doug Harned : And then just switching over, earlier when you talked about munitions, this is something that also looks like -- it looks like there's a lot of potential growth here. How do you think about this? I mean, I think of it as a high-margin business for you within Combat and potential to have orders well beyond that 3.70 that you got this quarter? Phebe Novakovic : So -- and I think I may have alluded to this in my remarks that, our customer has expressed an interest in increasing that demand. So we're working with them on increasing production. But I think your predicated about a high-margin business is not quite based. In fact, we are -- OTS where we do all of this work is a high-performance organization with respect to operating leverage. But that comes from a very wide and vast portfolio. So we do okay, but I wouldn't say that they were additive. Doug Harned : So you don't think of it as a higher-margin business. I just thought traditionally, it was a higher-margin business than perhaps some of the other parts of combat vehicles, and that's not the case? Phebe Novakovic : OTS, on occasion, will be a higher-margin business, but that's largely about mix, and it's not driven by 1 particular line of business. They've got an awful lot of contracts and the high-velocity contract turnover. So I think that's how you should think about them. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Doug. Lisa, we'll take one more question, please. This will be our final. Operator : Our final question today comes from Scott Deuschle of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Scott Deuschle : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I think ROIC is something that you've historically been very focused on. And honestly, it's held up really well here despite the capital that you put in the business. So just curious, as you get past the bulk of the CapEx phase of marine working capital comes out of the business and you have margins reflected aerospace? Where do you think ROIC can go over the next few years? Jason Aiken : It's a great question. Obviously, as we've been in this period of extended investment, you'd expect to see ROIC become a little bit muted as a result. And we saw a little bit of a downtick in that during that investment period. But as we emerge having had essentially the investment period behind us. To your point, we absolutely expect to see ROIC back on decline. We'll see that this year, and we expect to see it next year and beyond. So our targets over the long term ought to be back in the range as we were in prior to the investment period we entered into a few years ago, and that's what you should expect as well. Scott Deuschle : Okay. Great. And then Jason, does the recently announced facility expansion of Savannah, does that have any impact to the prior guidance you gave on '23 CapEx? Or was that embedded in the 2% figure you previously talked about? Thank you. Jason Aiken : Yes, that's all embedded and now look we've given previously. So no change to those projections. Scott Deuschle : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks. Howard Rubel : Thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for both our earnings release and, of course, our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With my introduction complete, I\u2019d turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10,850 million, operating earnings of $1,230 million and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%. So, the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects consistent with our forecast and sell side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%, operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%. Net earnings by $90 million or 10% and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%, net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.64, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment. Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year. Jason Aiken : Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1 times for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance. That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed three potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter; the pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures; the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the UK; and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the UK, though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations. I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release. First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only one more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren\u2019t as attractive because three aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41. As a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.4 times at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5 times. To give you a little more color, Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past two years, over 400 net orders after default and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022 and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings. With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet. Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than one-third of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business with particular strength in artillery rounds. Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9% and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago, of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate. In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2 times book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings. So, Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023. Jason Aiken : The Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and sequentially, were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this. For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed. With respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they've been facing. With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022. Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022 and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully funds the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past two years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations. However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher than anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year. We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63. And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up. In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion, up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point. To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 at around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group. To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single digit pace consistent with the past two years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So, for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years with sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital. Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A. A - Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolf Research. Myles Walton : I was hoping maybe you could touch on a couple of things. One, Jason, your new role and how you sort of think about balancing the act between the CFO and the operating segment roles and responsibilities which you intend to focus on there. And then maybe on the capital deployment front for '23 at 105%, obviously, you've got a lot of excess cash. Should we expect you to pick up repurchase activity in '23 versus '22 or relatively similar? Jason Aiken : Myles, I think with respect to your first question, looking at the new responsibility and that opportunity. First and foremost, it's important to remember that these businesses are run by two excellent and accomplished presidents. And frankly, I have the highest level of confidence in them and their teams. When I look back over recent history in this role, Chris Marzilli, really helped steer this business through a period of remarkable change and transformation, not to mention COVID. And I don't think as I look ahead that this market is going to become any less dynamic. So I think the focus really is on continuing to make sure that the businesses continue to focus on their bottom line, earnings and cash as always but frankly, also finding our way to a sustainable top line growth trajectory, and that will really be the emphasis. In terms of balancing the two, I'm humbled and honored to have this dual responsibility, fortunately entering my tenth year in the role as CFO. So I feel confident about the ability to handle both at the same time. Phebe Novakovic : So with respect to our capital deployment, we'll continue to invest in our business where prudent. We'll continue to maintain our dividend and we'll repurchase shares accordingly. So I don't see any big change in the priorities at least for our execution. Operator : Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Phebe, could you touch on -- you mentioned three deliveries that slipped out. Was that customer preference, was that supply chain related? And then it doesn't appear that you're going to -- your prior guidance was 148 deliveries this year, now you're talking 145. So it doesn't seem any makeup there. And then last thing, the 170, I think you forecasted for '24 deliveries. Does that still hold? Phebe Novakovic : So let me go in order. We had, as I noted, three airplanes have slipped into this quarter. One was simply an issue that we just couldn't get it completed in time and two of them were customer preferences for international deliveries. With respect to the production next year, we are confident that we can make that and our trajectory going forward past this year remains the same. So directionally and we're right on track, and we're comfortable we get there. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Marine and the supply chain challenges at Electric Boat. And specifically, what we should be looking for in terms of any particular metrics, whether it's hiring or deliveries or certain milestones to get a sense that things are firming there and kind of also what the risk is of further deterioration in schedules. Phebe Novakovic : So let's deconstruct that and I think we have to posit few truth. We went into COVID with scheduled variants on Virginia. Virginia is also about a third of the Electric Boat revenue. COVID had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, but particularly lasting one on the workforce. We had labor discontinuities throughout the United States and we also experienced something that we had not anticipated abnormally large retirement of experienced workers. In a business that is heavily manpower dependent, these impacts had a disproportionate effect on additional schedule variants. We are working with the Navy who's been quite active and engaged in helping develop a plan and a really detailed action list on how to address these issues. And ship building and the supply chain are fixed by incremental improvements over time. So, what do we see at the moment? We see stabilization in the workforce. I think across the nation, we've got a little bit better labor dynamics than we did immediately coming out of COVID. We also have additional experience in what some of the challenges have been. So the way I look at it, this year will give us a bit of a chance to dig further see funds to the velocity of the material coming into Electric Boat. And that ought to be a good thing for all involved despite and notwithstanding the considerable issues around schedules. I would note that the Submarine Industrial base delivered two submarines last year, and we're going to deliver two more this year. So, I think maintaining that cadence of delivery is important. But in much of shipbuilding, milestones are difficult to identify really until you get the ship in the customers' hands. So, as I said, we're working very closely with the Navy to ensure that we could just get back some of that schedule variance on the remainder of the Block 4 ships and on the Block 5 ships. Seth Seifman : And maybe just to follow up specifically on that. Most of the discussion -- our discussion today and then the trade press has been about Virginia. How's the Columbia schedule holding up? Phebe Novakovic : So we're about 30% done on the first ship and we are ahead of the contract schedule. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Phebe, maybe just to stay on Seth's line of question just on Marine. Maybe you could just -- there's been a lot written about just the industrial base, and you just mentioned it. How are you thinking about just maybe the CapEx profile and in particular, things start to get unveiled on [ACAS] (ph), what the plans might be there? Just should we expect any further step-up in CapEx [Technical Difficulty]? Phebe Novakovic : Not with respect to ACAS. And I think we have, as I've said on earlier calls and to many of you in person, we'll just take our lead from our Navy customer on how they want us to respond to all of this. So this is really an intergovernmental series of discussions and agreements and we will, of course, support whatever the Navy plan is going forward. Peter Arment : And just as a quick follow-up, just maybe just in general on the supply chain. You talked about the constraints in marine and some of the issues at Mission Systems. Has it gotten worse submission or do you think it's actually kind of stabilized? And this is just -- if is what it is, what's going on in the marketplace? Jason Aiken : So I think with respect to Mission Systems, we have to really focus on what it is we're talking about here, which is really chips and microelectronics, right? So unlike some of the other parts of the business, which are heavily labor and availability of workforce driven. So this is really, obviously, for Mission Systems an issue that's impacting industries much broader than just us or us in the Aerospace and Defense side. And I think when these issues first surfaced, Mission Systems did a really nice job of developing workarounds, right? Finding alternate sourcing, certifying substitute parts and so on. So, all of those actions were predicated on the expectation that the supply chain would kind of come through this and get over the hump within, call it, a year plus or minus. But frankly, as we've continued to work our way through it, it's become clear that we're not always at the top of the priority list for some of these sources of supply. So when they saw the bottlenecks we were dealing with were going to persist somewhat longer than expected, the team really adapted to this new normal with a whole new set of tactics. That includes procuring key components with longer lead times anywhere from 12 to 18 or even 24 months, as well as working with key suppliers to improve the forecasting that we were giving them and the reliability of demand so that they could have confidence in where we were going and allocate additional capacity to us and our priorities. So, all of that is in place and underway. As you might imagine, some of those things take a little longer to yield results. So that's why we're expecting that to kind of come through in the second half of this year. But we do feel like they've got a good plan in place, they've taken great corrective actions, and we just need to see that all sort of roll out and to get to the other side of this, but it's likely to be toward the second half back into this year before that all takes hold. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ron Epstein : You've talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the impact that the Ukraine could potentially have on Land Systems. Maybe from a bigger strategic point of view, it seems like in the past, the logic had always been the Army was a bill payer for the Navy and the Air Force. Is that -- are we learning a different lesson now out of the Ukraine and what kind of implications potentially does that have for your Land Systems business? Phebe Novakovic : So, if you look at the services funding over, I'd say, in the modern air post World War II, the Army gets funded when they're tactical challenges and tactical problems, either a hot war, relatively cold war or preparedness, this is an issue where we've got both strategic challenges in which the Navy and the Air Force tend to get funded. And as I noted, the threat environment has materially changed. So that has driven increased interest in a number of Army and land forces capabilities. And as we've begun to see those show up in our in our backlog and in our order book, but we've got more room to grow and more room to go there as some of this demand converts into actual orders. So, when I think about what's going on in Europe, our European Combat Vehicle business has done quite well in securing a number of contracts, both historically but increasingly recently and on a -- what we expect on a going forward basis. They've been active in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg. By the way, I wrote all those down because that's a lot of countries. So I think the closer you are to the threat, the more urgent you feel your funding requirements. So all of which is to say, we have changed our expectations for Combat Systems growth. By the way, overarching all of this is a need to increase our ammunition and projectile output, and we've been working with the Army for the last three, four, five months on exactly that kind of plan. So as we've always posited, the threat environment really drives demand for defense products and we're seeing some of that now. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Jason Gursky : Jason, I want to take the opportunity to ask you a question about the Technologies Group. I know you've been in the seat for just a small amount of time, but I'm maybe curious to know as you settle into your seat, the kinds of investments that you think you might want to make either in technologies or new products and services or in processes BD in order to accelerate revenue. Just kind of get your first impressions on the needs there in the group and what might change with you now taking over leadership of that group. Jason Aiken : So I think the way to think about this group between GDIT and Mission Systems, technologies taken together, is that we currently are and have been for quite some time, in a model and of the capability set that a lot of the peer companies out there are trying to get to. That is a well balanced and comprehensive set of offerings between the traditional federal IT services offerings as well as cyber, hardware and other elements of that portfolio. And so I don't think we have to necessarily play catch up as much in that game. I think there's always opportunities to refine and enhance the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to stop being a dynamic environment. We are, as always, have continued to invest internally in new technology capabilities, that will continue to be the case. As you know, I'll say what I know Phebe would say if she were talking right now. We're not going to speculate about M&A. There's always the possibility for bolt-on acquisitions. I would note, by the way, since you brought up the point that since we acquired CSRA in 2018 and essentially transformed the face of this group with the size and capability of our federal IT services business. There have been -- if I look at GDIT's competitor group, call it, the top five or six main peers, there have been some 40 to 45 acquisitions in that space that those companies have taken on and we have not done any. We've done a couple of small bolt-ons in Mission Systems during that time, but nothing in GDIT space. And so it's interesting to see how the others are behaving in the aftermath of that activity and a lot of the consolidation that's happened in the industry. But I think we put ourselves in very good stead and we see a lot of a lot of others following suit. So I don't think there's a massive sea change in what we have planned ahead, but we'll continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : So you margin was up a little bit sequentially at Gulfstream and yet my understanding was you had some software warranty charges in the second and third quarter associated with the G500 and G600. So were there any other -- what were the reason the margins weren't a bit better there in Aerospace? Phebe Novakovic : The margins are pretty darn good. We have performed what we had told you. And so we were pretty pleased with that. I would note that one of the headwinds is R&D. So the additional work that has been required from the airworthiness directive and the new FAA requirements as a result of the MAX have driven increased R&D. And we'll continue to see some of that and then that will begin to unwind. But I think those are very strong margins and better than we had anticipated in our guidance to you. Cai von Rumohr : And Jason, the guide for Mission Systems margins is down over 200 bps from where you've been. Once things start to sort out, where do you see Mission Systems margins can go? Can they go back to where they were? Jason Aiken : So I want to make sure I think you're saying technologies as a whole because we don't really give -- or business unit specific margin guidance within the group. But given what you're saying, I think if you look back to prior to the CSRA acquisition, when the IT services side of the business became, frankly, our largest business group and the lion's share, the sort of two thirds, if you will, or more of the technologies grew. We used to -- the combined margin of those businesses used to be in the, call it, the low double digit range, it's usually between 10% and 11% on a fairly consistent basis. Since we acquired CSRA, we've averaged over the past five years 9.8% margin for the group. So what we're seeing right now is really just a shift in the moment where we've had GDIT come through that significant integration effort for the first couple of years followed immediately on the footsteps of that with the impacts of COVID, they've really embarked on a nice steady trajectory now of low single digit growth for several years now, and we expect to see that continue. As Mission Systems in the moment is dealing with the supply chain issues that have been, I think, well addressed, their volume is down a bit. So what we're seeing in terms of the group's margin, aggregate margin, is really nothing more than a shift in the mix between the two. So that's with the increased service side of the business and the lower volumes on the product and hardware side of the business. So as Mission Systems comes through this and gets back on track to a growth level, which we do expect to see happen once they come through these issues, you ought to see the margin on an aggregate basis tick back up. And by the way, that's not -- shouldn't overlook the fact that GDIT on its own is continuing to improve and harvest its margins as it grows. I think I said before, they had their highest margin as a business since we acquired CSRA and their highest earnings contribution to the company ever. So everything, I think, is headed in the right direction, just got to come through the supply chain issues at Mission Systems and that will help influence the mix, and we ought to see a trend back up toward the 10% level over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Pete Skibitski : Just following on to Ron's question earlier on combat and that was standing the flat outlook for this year, but you talked about the international demand, and it seemed like Congress added quite a bit of money for Stryker and Abrams to the '23 budget. So can you give us any sense of kind of the CAGR that you think is a reasonable expectation after 2023 when things begin to -- or when the demand begins to actually convert for you? Phebe Novakovic : So I think what we're looking at now is low single digit growth. So if we see anything over time that accelerates that, we'll certainly let you know that that's our best planning in the moment in consultation with our customer. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Maybe overall on the defense portfolio as a whole, all three segments. When you think about it, you're guiding the business flat on the top line perspective and EBIT as well. The budget is up 10 and you have some pretty good programs in there. How do you think about that delta and when it catches up to the budget and EBIT growth resumes? Phebe Novakovic : So I think that's more in '24. One of the big issues there, as I said, is Virginia. But look, the way I look at the defense portfolio, we have an extremely strong backlog and now it's just a question of executing, executing across that portfolio. So I'm not too worried about growth on the defense side at all nor on the aerospace side. There is one thing that I think we're focused on, we should be focused on, and I neglected to mention this earlier. But with respect to execution, one of the things that we can do on Virginia and frankly at EB, in general, is to continue to improve our operating performance. That provides us more ability to cover some of the perturbations that are coming out of the supply chain. So I really think about all of this as execution. Growth comes when it comes. We've got the backlog to support it. And so I like the position we're in, frankly. Sheila Kahyaoglu : And then if I could ask one more. I don't know if you provided it. Can you give us an update on the G700, G800 certification processes? Phebe Novakovic : So we still expect the G700 to convert -- get certified this summer. And the G800 will be about six months after that, so we don't see any change in that. And the relationship has been going very well with the FAA. So we are continuing to look forward to finishing all the certification processes. Now that -- I will tell you that is outside our complete control, a lot of this is FAA resources and their ability to focus, given all the other demands that they have on them, but so far so good. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC. Phebe Novakovic : I guess, we lost him. Ken Herbert : Sorry about that. I was muted. I wanted to first ask, within Aerospace, really good growth in the services business. What's the outlook for services growth in '23 as part of the aerospace guide? And can you talk a little bit about investments that you're making in that business? Phebe Novakovic : We expect low single digit growth in our service side. And we continue to invest prudently when we see the need for more service capacity. But at the moment, we're pretty -- nothing really outstanding in that regard. You've got the capacity to accommodate what we see as reasonable steady growth. Ken Herbert : And just a quick clarification on the 700 certification this summer. As obviously, you commented you're working with the FAA closely and a lot of this is -- or some of this is out of your control. How would you characterize your visibility or sort of the ongoing risks around I guess, FAA capacity to support that? I mean do you feel like you're well through that risk retirement or is there still substantial uncertainty and risk associated with that summer time frame? Phebe Novakovic : I think the FAA has done a good job managing its portfolio and a series of complex and multifaceted requirements. And so far, we are sticking to what we believe is a reasonable expectation for the certification. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Just a couple of quick ones from me, Phebe. First of all, on Ukraine, it looks like they're going to get Abrams tanks. At what point does capacity in some form or other particularly staffing become an issue? And then secondly, just for Jason, what sort of book-to-bill have you assumed in aerospace for 2023 in your cash flow guidance? Phebe Novakovic : Staffing is not an issue here. There is plenty of capacity on the combat vehicle side, both tracked and wheeled. So to the extent that the US government intends to execute any contracts with respect to some of these bilateral agreements that they are developing, we can -- it's well within the capacity of the industrial base to accommodate. Jason Aiken : And then, Rob, with respect to your second question, as it relates to aerospace book-to-bill, much like going into 2022, we've assumed a return to a 1 :1 book-to-bill and that is one of the predicates for our cash flow forecast. So to the extent they outperform, obviously, that could provide some upside. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Scott Deuschle : Phebe, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. I was curious if you could comment a bit more in depth on the sales pipeline at Gulfstream and the latest trends you're seeing there, both from individual buyers and the corporate buyers. And then for Jason, I was just wondering if you could identify what the unbilled receivable balance was on Ajax at the end of the year and how much of that you expect to burn down this year? Phebe Novakovic : With respect to our pipeline, I noted that it remains strong. I would also say that corporate America has been very active, both public and private companies, high net worth individuals. Europe remains slow. Mid East just picked up. Southeast Asia, let's say, not China, has been increasingly active. So we've got a good demand across all of our offerings in all of our aircraft. Jason Aiken : And then on your second question, as it relates to the Ajax unbilled, that's at the end of the year, roughly $1.7 billion is where we stand right now. I don't want to get into the specifics of how much we expect to collect this year, that's part of ongoing discussions with that customer. But needless to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do have good reason to expect those cash receipts to resume before the end of this quarter. And so we'll start to see that unbilled balance come down. Howard Rubel : Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We'll take one more question, please and then we'll wrap the call up. Operator : Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, going back to an earlier question on entry into service for 700 and 800. When would might we expect the R&D to decline, I don't know how much the 400 would use, and what would the incremental margins at Gulfstream look like once that happens? I imagine that's 24 or is it 25? Phebe Novakovic : So I think we expect R&D to begin to go down at the end of next year. And look, we have Gulfstream is an extremely high performing operationally strong company. And so I think we have demonstrated incremental improvement in margins as our operating efficiency and discipline in our supply chain, engineering. And really on the shop floor, all of that has improved. So I think there's upward over time, margin opportunity, but we're not going to get into parsing specifics until we have good clarity. But we're very comfortable that we will improve steadily and repeatedly. Robert Spingarn : And just a clarification on the FAA, you talked about it earlier. Are they still in the discovery process as they evolve their system after what's happened at peers over the past couple of years, or is there a set process that is in stone at this point? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, I think that that's a broader question than I'm able to answer. What I can tell you is that our relationship and working relationship with the FAA has matured significantly. And we think we all have a very clear understanding of what the new requirements are and how to execute them. Robert Spingarn : Okay, thank you very much. Howard Rubel : And thank you all for joining us today on this call. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics Web site for the fourth quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached later today on my office at (703) 876-3117. Operator? Operator : There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.  On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.64 per diluted share on revenue of $9.9 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is up $489 million or 5.2% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $30 million and net earnings are flat against the year ago quarter. This increase in operating earnings was offset by a $31 million increase in the tax provision. Recall that the first quarter 2022 tax provision was only 14%. Nevertheless, earnings per share are up $0.03 as a result of the stronger operating earnings and a lower share count. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.5%, 20 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This reflected lower operating margins in Aerospace and Marine, which I will address in some detail later in these remarks. Revenue was $489 million better than first quarter '22. All of the defense units were up and Aerospace down slightly, less than 1% on fewer aircraft deliveries. We beat consensus by $0.05 per share. We have roughly $550 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and lower-than-anticipated margins, leading to operating earnings basically consistent with expectations. The earnings per share beat was largely attributable to below the line items.  As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after CapEx was very strong. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in '22 and not at all typical for us in the first quarter. Obviously, we were off to a very good start from a cash perspective. This is an important respects, a strong quarter, a good foundation for the year, subject to some supply chain issues that I will try to eliminate as we discuss the business segments.  At this point, let me ask Jason to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group, which had a book-to-bill of 1.5x. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $89.8 billion, off 1.4% from the end of last year, but up 3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $128 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. It was another exceptional start to the year, with operating cash flow of $1.46 billion, representing 200% of net income. This very strong cash flow was heavily loaded in the last few weeks of the quarter. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a cash conversion rate of 178%. While we continue to enjoy strong cash performance in Aerospace & Technologies, the Combat Systems group, in particular, delivered outstanding free cash flow this quarter. As expected, the U.K. resumed payments on the AJAX program. This coupled with the ongoing progress payments on our other large international vehicle program drove the group's cash performance. This is consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.  Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $161 million or 1.6% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $345 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $90 million at just over $220 per share. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2 billion and a net debt position of $8.5 billion, down nearly $800 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter and we are in a position to pay that down with the cash on hand following the receipts at the end of the first quarter.  Our net interest expense in the quarter was $91 million compared to $98 million last year. Benefiting from the debt repayment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, we had a 17% effective tax rate in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.  Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. We're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was up 2.5% over the prior year, modestly ahead of our expectations for the start of the year. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, which gives us confidence about their outlook for the balance of the year. And GDIT had their highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 4 years as they continue to deliver on their year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings of $299 million were consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%.  As we discussed in January, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume. Backlog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1 on strong order activity in IT services that included some important wins not yet factored into the backlog. This includes the Army's flight test school training support services contract valued at $1.7 billion. And Air Force IDIQ with a total potential value of $4.5 billion between 2 awardees for security support services, and a pair of IDIQ contracts with the EPA with a potential value of $380 million to support the agency's environmental and climate initiatives.  In fact, GDIT booked the highest orders they've seen since the second quarter of 2019. And their pipeline remains robust with $19 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $84 billion in qualified opportunities identified.  Now let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. Now I may review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace held its own in a very difficult operating environment. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $229 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $11 million less than last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 4 fewer aircraft. The fewer aircraft deliveries were almost completely offset by higher ball stream services, debt aviation volume and special missions work at Gulfstream. The 21 deliveries in the quarter are 3 fewer than planned, two 280s did not deliver because of late engine deliveries. The other plan, a large cabin for an international customer didn't deliver because of simple bureaucratic registration delays in the owner's country.  Importantly, this is the first quarter in which we have missed an airplane delivery as a result of supply chain issues. Up until now, we have managed to work around late to schedule parts delivery. Operating earnings of $229 million or $14 million behind last year's first quarter as a result of a 70 basis point degradation in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was under pressure as a result of fewer new airplane deliveries, a less attractive mix, severe supply chain issues, some modest cost increases from suppliers and the prebuild of G700. Let's take a look at some of these elements in greater detail.  The shortage of parts to schedule from the supply chain, especially from Honeywell has created significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient. We have a young, well trained and capable workforce. They have, however, never previously been exposed out of station work. They are doing well. I am pleased to report, but it had an impact. The other impact of latest scheduled parts deliveries, apart from cost growth is that we cannot increase our build rate until the supply of parts is more predictable. The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We see the vast majority of this problem resolving early in the third quarter, but for 2 large suppliers who will take a little longer to resolve.  As most of you know, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. To do that, we must build them now and incur some period costs without the related revenue. This has impacted the first quarter and will impact the second quarter, but relief is in sight as deliveries commence. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 0.9:1 in dollar terms and 1 :1 in units. The quarter was looking quite good until the 2 regional bank failures in early March. This created a pause in the market for about 3 weeks. I am pleased to report that normal activity has resumed. Strong sales activity and customer interest is evident in this quarter. The U.S. has been strong and the Middle East as well. China remains slow. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacture and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of the G700 for late summer this year.  Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is well underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  Looking forward to the next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircrafts with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarter deliveries, as we have previously indicated. In short, the Aerospace team did a good job under difficult circumstances.  Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.76 billion, up 4.8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $245 million are up 7.9% and margins at 14% represent a 40 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. So we saw a strong operating performance coupled with a nice revenue uptick. At Land Systems, Increased revenue came from the MPF ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia. At European Land Systems, we had higher Parana volume and OTS enjoyed higher artillery program volume. So we saw increased revenue performance at each of the businesses. Here's a little additional color on Combat Systems revenue results. Foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Combats revenue in the quarter due to the strength of the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, Combat Systems revenue growth would have been up 7.1% over the last year rather than the 4.8% we have just reported. We also experienced very strong order performance at Combat. Orders in the quarter are at their highest level in more than 8 years, evidencing the strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. There is clear upward pressure on our forecast for Combat Systems revenue and earnings in the year. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. As an aside, let me repeat a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter of '19. The first quarter of '21 was up 10.6% over '20 and first quarter 2022 was up 6.8% over '21. Finally, this quarter revenue of almost $3 billion is up 12.9% over 2022. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. This quarter's growth was led by Columbia class construction and engineering, DDG-51 construction and some T-AO volume. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, exactly the same as a year ago, but with a 90 basis point decrement in operating margin. The primary driver of lower margins during the quarter was a charge on the Virginia program to reflect cost pressure within our supply chain and efficiency impacts at electric boat as a result of late material deliveries. This was partially offset by Colombia margin improvement. Other modest margin impacts included an earnings decline at Bath as a result of a onetime pickup in the year ago quarter and cost inflation reimbursement that does not carry profits. Overall, earnings are what we expected, but revenue was higher, resulting in lower margins. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. I would say, however, that our quarterly progression differs from prior years and that the second quarter will be our lowest quarter because of mix and volume across the business. Nonetheless, we look forward to very strong third and fourth quarters. We will give you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was a challenging but in many respects, rewarding quarter. Howard Rubel : Thanks, Phebe. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Phebe, I wonder to ask a question about Marine and at the risk of asking the question that you just said that we never update guidance at this time of year. If you can just give us some color, given what we thought about revenue and margin at Marine coming in. The revenue is clearly much stronger in Q1, the margin weaker for the obvious reason of the Virginia charge. Can you help us from here in terms of how the Virginia contribution changes from Q1 going forward now that the charge is done? And it seems Columbia is maybe coming in stronger. And if I could tack on one follow-up, there's been a lot of talk about the Columbia schedule, both in congressional testimony, GAO reports, et cetera. If you can give us the latest update on how you view the schedule for Columbia. Phebe Novakovic : So we think that we plan to have Q1 as our lowest margin quarter. And we'll continue to work to that. Virginia is -- it will stabilize once we get the schedule and supply chain issues resolved. But at this point, it's some comment on electric boat to continue to do better to offset those costs. So with respect to revenue, there's clearly some upside pressure there, but we're going to hold any other additional comment for the moment.  So let's go to Colombia. And I think just the Navy has clearly articulated it -- firmly articulated that we are ahead of the contract schedule. The contract schedule is what matters. So let's put a little context on this. We are on the Colombia. We are 16 years into the 20-year lead ship schedule. I think within that context, it's indicative of the actions we have taken heretofore and those that we will continue to take to keep this program on schedule. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I may be wrong, but it sounds like these supply chain issues in Q1 got worse. So I was wondering if you could comment on that. And also, what sort of mitigation plans you're putting in place to correct these problems? Phebe Novakovic : Specifically, are you talking about a particular group? Robert Stallard : Well, it seems like it's Aerospace and the Virginia-class submarine and marine. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So with Aerospace, we have -- let's be clear, we have been dealing with supply chain issues for some time, and we've been able to manage through them. This quarter, we had 2 large suppliers get worse. We have, however, as I noted in my remarks, light at the end of the tunnel by our clear visibility in -- through our clear visibility into the third and fourth quarters where the majority of the supply chain improves. And we're working very hard with all suppliers, both in terms of teams and additional production help and to also encourage them to allocate the necessary resources in order to make their contracting schedules. So we are pretty comfortable that we can resolve these issues in the third and fourth quarter. But Gulfstream has done a magnificent job heretofore in even this quarter and managing through these challenges. With respect to the Virginia-class program, we have been talking about the supply chain challenges for some time. And as with all heavy manufacturing and labor-intensive manufacturing construction projects, manpower is a significant impact and the impact from the -- and the ramifications from the pandemic hit that supply chain pretty hard. We're beginning to see that remedy with the help of the Navy and a lot of support. So we'll continue to work with our supply chain and all elements of that supply chain as well as our customer who is very engaged to ensure that we can get that Virginia cadence back on schedule. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Phebe, on -- when we're looking at the situation in Europe right now, I mean, 2 things seem to stand out to us with respect to Combat. One is, as you mentioned, the demand for munitions. But we've seen in the 2024 budget, there was actually a reduction in the budget for munitions, which we found somewhat surprising. How do you think about the trajectory there? And your ability to -- assuming we are going to see significant growth in munitions demand and your ability to ramp up production over time? Phebe Novakovic : We have been working very closely with DoD and the Army to ensure that we increase production and move... Douglas Harned : Hello? Phebe Novakovic : Hello, can you hear us? Jason Aiken : Operator? Operator : He appears to have lost audio. Jason Aiken : Okay. Are we still... Phebe Novakovic : Let me answer, Doug. Can the rest of the call here us? Operator : Yes, we are still live. Phebe Novakovic : Okay. So let me answer Doug's question. We've been working very closely with DoD and the Army to increase production and throughput. And we've done that in a couple of ways, upgrading existing facilities increasing the number of shifts and building new facilities with more modern equipment. So to, again, accelerate production, we have already done so and are quite confident in our ability to do even more.  So we are -- we've been receiving adequate and -- completely adequate funding to execute all of this. And we are quite confident that we will move throughput much quicker and will expedite the delivery of this critical capability to the Army. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Peter Arment : Phebe, thanks for the color on Gulfstream. Just on the overall demand kind of restrengthening in the quarter post the banks in the Middle East and certainly the U.S. Are you still seeing kind of broad interest across all the models? I know you've mentioned G650 in particular the last like 2 years has been very strong. Phebe Novakovic : Broad interest across all the models. We're doing quite well. Do you want to ask another question? Peter Arment : Yes, sure. No, I appreciate that. Just staying within Gulfstream. Just I know that you're not going to update kind of guidance, but I -- the deliveries that you missed this quarter, are they expected to recover in the second quarter? How are we thinking about that? Or is this all kind of second half related? Phebe Novakovic : We will resolve -- we expect to resolve all of the supply chain issues. And what you ought to think about is the third quarter and fourth quarter being quite robust. And I think what you're getting at is the deliveries that we expect to execute for the year at about 145. We're pretty confident we can get there. If we miss, it's just going to be by a little. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Phebe, I was hoping you could talk to how you balance within Marine higher-priority national -- the national level of the Columbia class, which is under a lower financial risk cost plus contract versus the higher financial pressure, Virginia class which is under fixed price contract, but you might have to pull resources away and just how you're managing that from a financial risk perspective? Phebe Novakovic : So implicit in your question is the fact that Colombia enjoys a higher national rating in terms of urgency than Virginia. We had fully contemplated that with the U.S. Navy when we negotiated the most recent block of Virginia that was in concert timing wise with the Columbia negotiation. So we're working with the Navy to ensure that the language that we had incorporated into the Virginia contract to accommodate any such impacts on Virginia from a Columbia prioritization could be addressed. And the Navy has been working very closely with us. So we were mindful of that and have been for some time. Myles Walton : And so I guess just for a clarification, Phebe. Did the current financials reflect that assumption playing out? Or would there be a sort of equitable relief in the future if they agree with the position? Phebe Novakovic : I'm not going to speculate on how this will be addressed ultimately with our customer. But, this is more of a future issue rather than in the moment issue. That was not the primary driver of the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : If you hadn't had the loss of 3 weeks from the bank failures, I assume then the book-to-bill would have been above 1 in the first quarter. And is that likely to continue then in the second quarter where you're saying we are seeing significant strength now? Phebe Novakovic : So our plan going before March 10, was that, in fact, we had anticipated a book-to-bill -- full book-to-bill of 1 :1 on at that point, higher deliveries. So on a going-forward basis, it's our working assumption that we will continue to see 1 :1. And at the moment, we see no reason why that can't be achieved. George Shapiro : Okay. So the delivery expectations for next year would still be the same as what you had laid out before? Phebe Novakovic : We are holding to what we gave you in terms of out-year expectations for Aerospace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Louie DiPalma : Is the lead Columbia approximately 1/3 complete now? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Louie DiPalma : Great. And as a follow-up, you referenced supply chain headwinds with Virginia and Aerospace. Is the supply chain for Mission Systems improving at all? Jason Aiken : It absolutely is. We saw a good trajectory and gaining some traction in the quarter. That's part of the reason why volume was up nicely in the quarter, and they seem to be on a good path to overcoming that bottleneck in their system. So gives us confidence for the opportunities we have in the second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Phebe, per new plans unveiled last month under the August pack, it looks like Australia could buy up to 5 Virginia-class submarines potentially in the early 2030s. So with the backlog now of 17 Virginia is delivering through 2032, how are you thinking about this opportunity? And what's the production capacity required to meet this demand? Phebe Novakovic : So we are working with our Navy customer to clarify timing and capacity and throughput. But at the moment, we have no particular insight, not really deferring to the Navy on and the timing and specificity of their long-range planning? Kristine Liwag : And if I could sneak another one, maybe switching to combat. Look, it seems like the Army is pushing significantly to ramp artillery production, particularly the 155-millimeter shells and planning to double monthly production to about 24 per month by year-end. And then increasing production 6x over the next 5 years. How are you thinking about this opportunity? And again, do you see -- what do you need to do in order to meet this demand? Should it materialize? And are you seeing the orders come through? Phebe Novakovic : We have seen the orders come through. And we do not yet have out your clarity on the exact timing of the additional production, but we will see additional production. And because of the priority of the 155, I think the nation has learned a lot about 155 artillery shelf. So we've done a lot to increase production already, and we are quite confident that we can go even faster. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : I wanted to ask kind of a high-level question on pilots for biz jet. On the commercial side, lack of kind of staffing with standing like pilots and crews has been kind of a pacing item. What's your sense for business jets or your customers kind of better off in that respect? Or could that potentially be a bottleneck for biz jet as well? Phebe Novakovic : Well, I think during the height of COVID, there was so much disruption at all labor markets that we may have seen some issue then. But frankly, it didn't impact us. We're not seeing anything at the moment that is impacting our ability to fly, our customers' ability to fly or frankly, flying hours. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss : The G700 is in there. Is software validation, the pacing item still? And if so, how far are the way through that are you? Phebe Novakovic : No, it is not. And we are in pretty good shape here with respect to our certification. And look, this is an extremely mature, safe and sophisticated aircraft. So we're working very closely with the FAA to ensure that they've got the proper resources here to execute the certification, but it is coming. David Strauss : Okay. A quick follow-up. Jason, you mentioned 8 resumptions of the AJAX payments. Can you update us on kind of the schedule for the liquidation there? How you expect that to play out and also on the Canada program? Jason Aiken : Yes. So obviously, it was a positive development to see the payments resume here in the first quarter as we expected. The path forward with the customer is an ongoing discussion, we've worked through the revised schedule for the program. But some of the other particulars around milestone payments and progress on that schedule are still in the works. So it would be probably remiss of me to get out ahead of that.  In terms of the Canadian program, things are continuing to proceed well. That customer for the past 3-plus years has paid on time as per that schedule we negotiated. And so a couple more payments to come this year. And then really, what you can think about it is the entire arrears that we were dealing with some 2, 3 years ago will have been paid down and will be in a normal program cadence and schedule at that point, so by the end of this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Kenneth Herbert : I just wanted to see -- I wanted to see if we could put a finer point on the Aerospace margins in the second quarter with supply chain issues and other timing around the certification and prebuild. Is it -- or second quarter margins expected to be similar to first quarter or was first quarter expected to be the trough for the year? Phebe Novakovic : I think you may need to think about the second quarter being our lowest quarter and then with a very steep and executable ramp-up in third -- third and fourth quarter, I tried to give you guys an awful lot of color in the remarks about the puts and takes on all the margins with respect to Aerospace. But we -- we'll get through the second quarter. And frankly, these first 2 quarters are aberrational in terms of Gulfstream margins, and then we ought to see nice pickup in third and fourth quarter. Kenneth Herbert : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just considering the roughly 100 aircraft implied in the guidance for the second half deliveries and the supply chain issues, are you having at this point to maybe look at second sources? Or is there anything else you're doing now? Obviously, it's very late in the game, but to maybe improve or do you further derisk the supply chain beyond just the execution? Phebe Novakovic : So we've been doing that for some time. As you all know, the supply chain on the Aerospace side has been taxed for quite a bit of time. So they were not taking any new actions that we haven't already executed, and we're just ramping up some of those actions as we -- in the first quarter and then as we go into the second.  But we have, as I said earlier, a very clear line of sight into the third and fourth quarters and the majority of these suppliers fully anticipate getting better. And we'll work with the remaining ones to ensure they've got the resources to execute the contract. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : Maybe just a quick question, maybe 2. What are the synergies so far from merging the 2 businesses in kind of mission Tech? How has that gone? Jason Aiken : So keep in mind, Ron, when we talk about merging those businesses, they still remain 2 independent and stand-alone operating units within our model. So not really anything to think about from a cost synergy perspective, I think the way to think about that is more of a revenue synergy point of view in that what we talked about is -- those 2 businesses are seeing a real convergence on a number of fronts within their markets, what their customers are interested in procuring in terms of end-to-end solutions that include the IT service side, software solutions as well as hardware as well as where their competitors are going in the market to address those demands.  So bringing those 2 businesses together has put us on a good footing to address that market and those demands. And that's what we're seeing, and you're seeing that in the positive order performance in the quarter and book-to-bill, capture rates, win rates and so on. So all of that gives us good confidence in terms of the trajectory of the outlook that we see for each of those businesses. Ronald Epstein : Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-on. How much of the free cash flow in the quarter can be attributed to AJAX? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we have factored the net of payments to the supply chain, which has been very patient through this whole period into our estimates for the year. Jason Aiken : Yes. So I want to make sure I understood your question correctly. It was a roughly GBP 480 million payment that was received. And to Phebe's point, that the net impact of that after paying out supply chain elements on the program, all of that's factored into the outlook that we have for the year. So that 105-ish percent conversion rate for the year that we talked about is now intact and all that much more certain based on the activity in the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : The issues on the Virginia supply chain, it seems like it's been a little bit of a black box. So just -- I was wondering if I can get more detail. Does it relate to multiple suppliers? And can you give us a sense of what parts are involved? And then are we feeling good that as the mix shifts to the Block 5 that margins will improve there? Phebe Novakovic : So it's multiple suppliers, some large and some small. And we have, again, continued to work with the Navy to address the challenges that they all have faced. And even though you have different sized businesses, many of them have been confronted with the same labor dysfunctions that we saw coming out of COVID. The Navy has been providing as well as the Congress been and providing funding to address some of the challenges within the industry -- some Marine industrial base, and we're hopeful that over time, that will resolve.  And we'll continue to see, I believe, improvement as we get into Block 5 and the supply chain stabilizes, but we've got ways to go there. And I think importantly, and this is the way we certainly think about it, Electric Boat just has to get better and faster to overcome any unexpected additional future supply chain challenges that may hit us. But we're not going to get into listing parts. This is an enormous supply chain. You can imagine with thousands of suppliers all over the nation. Peter Skibitski : That's fair. And kind of one follow-up Phebe. How is the -- how are you judging the pace of hiring and the labor risk kind of through the midterm at EB, just given the kind of the huge increases in volume that are required there? Phebe Novakovic : So again, coming out of COVID, I think we all felt a little bit of the labor constraint. But one of the reasons that we saw increased revenue in this quarter was extremely strong throughput coming out of as a result of robust hiring that they have executed and the training of those workers so that they hit the ground running, and we're able to have additional -- execute additional throughput up at So we consider that a good bellwether for our ability to continue to hire to meet our needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, Combat has been discussed throughout the call, but just a couple of quick things. Would you -- is it fair to assume that the book-to-bill will continue to be above 1 for this year and beyond, just given the strength? And then the second part of this is, as armament munition sales grow will they be margin accretive or dilutive to the overall segment? Phebe Novakovic : So when you look at historically Combat orders, they tend to be pretty lumpy. I think the important way to think about it is the underlying credit could exist, let's say, it is an increasingly insecure and threat-driven environment, and that will drive additional orders, when those execute, will be a little bit lumpy, but we have -- we expect to see a continued demand, including on the munition side. But we have planned in -- for our plan this year, we've executed, we've anticipated margins that are pretty consistent with what they've been doing. It's just executing, operating, ensuring that we've got operating leverage, including on these new facilities that we're putting in place. But recall, this is a group that has extremely strong operating leverage and based on their efficiency and blocking and tackling on the shop floor. So we'll expect to see margins continue. Howard Rubel : And operator, we'll take this one last question, please, and then we'll wrap up the call. Operator : Certainly, your final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. So Phebe, I'm still a little confused about your statement that Q2 earnings should be the lowest because pretty clearly, it looks like Marine should be better absent the VCM charge. Combat usually is a little better. GDIT is stable. And you've highlighted Aerospace, but the volume is going to be higher than it was in the first quarter. Margins given where the volume was actually looked pretty good in the first quarter. So it would seem to imply a pretty steep drop-off in margins. Could you give us some color in terms of what is creating that situation? And is that something we should be worried about will continue in the third and fourth quarter? Phebe Novakovic : I tried to be pretty clear that we do not anticipate any -- at Gulfstream, the margin performance in these 2 first quarters replicating in third and fourth quarter. In fact, we see a fairly strong ramp to increase margins. These margins are aberrational and we do expect some additional perturbations on the supply chain and out of station work Gulfstream as well as mix issues.  With respect to Marine systems, it's material timing between first and second quarters. And in technologies, it's transitioned from mature programs that are winding down and being replaced by some follow-on new starts. So in each one of these groups, we are seeing a convergence of in the quarter, particularly lower margins and lower earnings and sales than we typically see. We usually have a steady build through the year. This is rather, as I said, aberrational, but we'll get through this. And importantly, we don't see these issues leading into third and fourth quarter, we anticipate a very strong third and fourth quarter, and that is unchanged.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Howard Rubel : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time Board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segments, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace. While revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year\u2019s second quarter. So, we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year\u2019s first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes. As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the Company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1 :1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace and Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There\u2019s no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we\u2019d expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter, in fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory. Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they\u2019ve seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified. Now, let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. Now, let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year\u2019s second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation\u2019s completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency. In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work. Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year\u2019s second quarter as a result of a 60 basis-point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins. Moving to the demand environment. Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree. The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is a flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I\u2019ll have more on this later in my remarks. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year-ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis-point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So, we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin, in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis-point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So, a very exciting first half for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis-point decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis-point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So, a good quarter and first half. So, let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I\u2019m about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won\u2019t repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So, we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same. One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the Company that he intends to retire later this year. So, this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Howard Rubel : Thank you for your kind words and friendship. It\u2019s been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community these nearly six years. I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today, I want to say thank you. Now, let\u2019s turn to the question-and-answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JP Morgan. Seth Seifman : Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. Thanks for everything. Just on the new Aerospace guidance, I guess, maybe if you could walk through how you thought about the setup for that. And I appreciate that this is mainly a timing issue and that any airplanes that don\u2019t get delivered in \u201823 can kind of move to \u201824. But just kind of the way we get level set. With 27 deliveries in the third quarter, we\u2019re talking about something quite high to get to 140-ish for the year. And also, I mean, with 27 deliveries, I assume we\u2019ll be looking at a margin in Q3 that\u2019s probably still in the 12s and so also getting to 14.1% for the year. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the margin -- the initial margin accretion from the new aircraft and what that contribution will be to the total deliveries. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, I think you\u2019ve put your finger on a nub of an issue. So, what we have given you with respect to Aerospace is Gulfstream\u2019s plan, and the guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery. Remember, too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We\u2019ve expanded our wing line. In short, we\u2019ve facilitized for increased production. And finally, the fact that we have planes -- and you can see this from the increase in inventory that are awaiting parts, we now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to -- will give us the ability to deliver. With respect to margin, we\u2019ve got a number of higher-margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the fourth quarter. So, that provides significant uplift. So, we kind of explained how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries, and the margin is really a question of mix of higher deliveries of higher-margin -- greater deliveries of higher-margin airplanes. Seth Seifman : Okay. And just a follow-up real quick on this topic. The 27 deliveries in Q3 would be down year-on-year. And so in terms of -- there\u2019s the issue of the G700 certification, which we\u2019re all kind of looking at and it\u2019s hard to analyze. But just for the non-G700 deliveries, is there any risk around what the plan was there and what Gulfstream expects to do? Phebe Novakovic : So, as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes. And we have reliable -- increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they\u2019re more likely -- likely to anticipate more catch-up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they\u2019re still impacting the third quarter deliveries. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : I can\u2019t believe Howard\u2019s retiring. He\u2019s so young. Phebe Novakovic : That\u2019s what we say. Robert Stallard : Anyway, I\u2019ve got a couple of questions for you, Phebe. First of all, on the revised Aerospace guidance, you mentioned that you\u2019ve increased your expectations for services for the full year. I was wondering if you could square this with what we\u2019ve been seeing in Biz Jet flight hours year-to-date, which have been down year-on-year. And then secondly, a great Combat Systems order quarter, but how do you expect these orders to flow through to revenue growth over the next couple of years? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So, our flying hours are not down. But I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes -- new airplanes in the market increases. So, we expect steady growth in service. And we haven\u2019t seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. I said that mostly other people flying hours. With respect to Combat, the world has become a less safe place, and that\u2019s reflected in the increased demand, both internationally and in the United States. So we expect the -- this year to be considerably higher than last year. And we\u2019ll give you clarity around 2024 in January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly, that trajectory has changed. We won\u2019t be able to -- we can\u2019t quantify it right now, but we\u2019ll give you more clarity on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss : So, back on the G700, would you expect to make up the missed deliveries this year? Would you expect them to make those up next year? So does the -- I think, what was -- 170 go higher in terms of what you\u2019re expecting for deliveries next year? Phebe Novakovic : Well, we\u2019ll get into next year, next year. But the deliveries are lower, are -- 5 to 6 deliveries that won\u2019t deliver this year are not 700s. So, it\u2019s other airplanes. David Strauss : Okay. Got it. And then as a follow-up -- quick follow-up. Combat Systems, you\u2019ve mentioned this during the prepared remarks, the lower margins in the quarter, and then it looks like you\u2019re forecasting a bit of a snapback in the second half of the year, but still a fair amount lower than what you were initially forecasting. Could you just give a little bit more detail on the mix and how that\u2019s impacting? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So mix in this instance is comprised of two elements. One is the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it\u2019s really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs, and those margins will improve as we come down our learning curves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Terrific. Thanks so much. So -- and Howard, let me say, you\u2019ve been terrific to work with and a great friend, and I wish you all the best. Howard Rubel : Thank you, Cai. Cai von Rumohr : So, Phebe, how many 700s are you assuming to deliver in the fourth quarter? And what kind of margin for error is there in terms of timing in terms of... Phebe Novakovic : We will deliver 19 G700s, and we\u2019re not going to tell you margins will be accretive. Nice try. Well, have we ever given you margins by airplane? Cai von Rumohr : No, no, no. I just -- so -- and next -- I didn\u2019t mean -- I meant how much time-wise, a cushion you have in the schedule if the certification slips. Phebe Novakovic : You mean the schedule for the 700 certification? Cai von Rumohr : Yes. I mean, is your best guess that you certify in the middle of November, in middle of December, which could impact the amount number of planes you get out\u2026 Phebe Novakovic : So, what we\u2019ve told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we\u2019ll deliver airplanes, but we won\u2019t necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That will bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history. But we\u2019re not anticipating that at the moment. So, I don\u2019t have real good clarity because we don\u2019t know yet with precision on when in the fourth quarter. But our best estimate, what we\u2019re planning for right now is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they\u2019re built -- the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries. Cai von Rumohr : Got it. And with all of these deliveries in the fourth quarter, maybe, Jason, can you give us some color in terms of the cash flow profile? I mean, do we have just a momentous fourth quarter cash? And is there any upside to the 105%? Jason Aiken : The way I think you need to think about that, Cai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So, the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order and aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So, while there\u2019s obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point. When those aircraft enter into service, it\u2019s not an outsized level of cash, one way or the other. So, the bigger issue is you\u2019ve got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book. And with the significant order volume that we\u2019ve had over the past 2, 2.5 years, that is sort of a machine that\u2019s just churning those progress payments over time as we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations on retirement, Howard. Miss you. In terms of the -- the outlook for Aerospace orders, could you just comment, Phebe, what you\u2019re seeing for the rest of the year? Obviously, the second quarter was probably helped a little bit because of the anomaly you mentioned in March around the banking crisis. And then also if you can comment on churn in the backlog, I think your net book-to-bill was a couple of hundred million lighter than your gross book-to-bill. So maybe just talk about any cancellations. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you quite rightly note, we had a three-week hiatus coincident with the banking -- many banking crisis. But the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we enter Q3, we have a very strong pipeline. And so far, activity is quite good in Q3. We had six defaults in the quarter, but nothing that is notable to us. And the backlog is holding up very, very well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Jason Gursky : Congrats, Howard. I look forward to getting some postcards from our in distant places. Phebe, just sticking with Gulfstream for one last question, hopefully here. On the pipeline and kind of what you see from a bottom-up perspective, can you give us a little flavor from a geographic perspective and customer type? How is high net worth doing versus corporate? And are we beginning to see some green shoots in geographies outside the United States? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So, the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500. I would say that high net worth is about the same. And the Mid East is pretty good, as is Asia, but it\u2019s really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long-established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. And then, Jason, over to you on Technologies. It sounds like you\u2019ve got a robust pipeline of opportunities in front of you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix of that? We had some margin degradation here in the quarter. I\u2019m just kind of curious, as you look out at that pipeline, do you see anything that would suggest we\u2019re going to see a departure in any -- either higher or lower from a margin perspective as you bid on this work and bring it in? Jason Aiken : I think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don\u2019t see any fundamental change, as we\u2019ve talked about. You\u2019re going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the two businesses, the IT services side being somewhat lower obviously than the hardware side. I think in this quarter, we saw it a little more pronounced because as we\u2019re seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it\u2019s actually replacement contracts, or I should say, recompetes that we\u2019ve won. So, you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature-level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry-level margin rates we\u2019re seeing now. So, that\u2019s sort of the driver of the year-over-year delta that you\u2019re seeing. But barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron Epstein : Yes. Hey. Good morning. And ditto Cai\u2019s remarks, Howard, you will be missed. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. So quickly, a couple of questions. On Technologies, what should we be looking for? I mean, sometimes the contracts there aren\u2019t as obvious in the horizon. So, Jason, what should we be looking out for in the second half of the year as potential things you guys could win? Jason Aiken : Ron, it\u2019s always tough in this business to point to a singular event or a contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it\u2019s a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think -- the thing I would tell you is, when you look at Mission Systems on the one hand, they are really seeing strong support in their -- what I\u2019d call, their Navy platform support businesses, whether it\u2019s the strategic side or the mission computing side. They\u2019re also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So, those are two areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business. When you look at GDIT, they\u2019re seeing strength in all three of their customer segments : the defense, the intelligence community and the Fed SIV side. So, really good across-the-board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any one thing in particular on that side of the portfolio, we\u2019ve talked for the past few weeks, a couple of months about some selective technology investments they\u2019ve been making to accelerate their growth, and we\u2019re seeing that really start to take hold. And of course, we\u2019re talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, Zero Trust and so on. And that\u2019s really starting to bear fruit. We\u2019ve seen already several hundred million dollars worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that\u2019s resulting directly from those investments. They\u2019ve got some $7 billion in change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they\u2019ve got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 billion, $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So, I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth, and we\u2019d expect to see the results of that continue in the second half of the year and beyond. Ron Epstein : Okay, great. And then maybe one follow-on for Phebe. When we think about Aero, when things start to normalize, right, supply chain kind of gets back to a normal cadence and all that, what should we be thinking about broadly as like a realistic margin target? Phebe Novakovic : We\u2019re thinking in the higher teens when we get on a steady state with upside potential. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Louie DiPalma : Howard, thank you for your deep aerospace-defense expertise in your current position and your former position on the sell side, your high standards raised the level of those around you. For Jason, for the Army\u2019s CHS-6 $8 billion recompete that should be announced, I think, very soon. GD Mission Solutions is teaming with GDIT. Do you feel these synergistic joint bids between IT and Mission will become more common and a significant strategic advantage for you? And could it help return the overall Technologies segment to mid-single-digit growth over the long term? Jason Aiken : Yes. And bottom line answer, you kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these two businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run. It\u2019s -- the predicate for all that is that what we\u2019ve seen both in the customer demand environment, what they\u2019re requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software, services and the hardware elements of what we provide. We\u2019re seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&A activities that you\u2019ve seen in the market. And so, we believe that is the thesis that we\u2019ll see play out. You noted CHS-6, we\u2019re obviously participating in and anticipating that -- resolution to that competition. We\u2019ve seen that program migrate over time from one that was traditionally very much focused on high-end, customized, ruggedized hardened-type defense hardware to one that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional, sort of off-the-shelf catalog-type product. And so, we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. So, that\u2019s just one good example of it. But absolutely, we see that over time. And as far as long-term growth rates, we\u2019ll have to see where this leads. Right now, we continue to track low- to mid-single digit, but we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t get some juice out of that over time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Howard, exactly what Louie said, and then, thank you for being such a great colleague and a teacher to me and all those around you, so thank you. Phebe or Jason, whoever, on the Defense business, when you look at your 2023 guidance, Defense growth is up solidly up 5% for the year versus the 9% growth you did in the first half. But this is not necessarily leading to operating leverage with margin contraction of 40 bps and flat operating profit. So, how do you think about the return to operating margin expansion either on a total company level or a segment basis? It seems like Technologies is more temporary, Combat mix maybe continues for some time. Phebe Novakovic : So, Technologies and Combat are simply a question of mix. And I suspect Combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine Group has significant supply chain challenges that have impacted for the Virginia-class in particular. That\u2019s going to take some time to resolve. We\u2019ll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So, as I noted, we expect slow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine Group, perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow and steady improvement over time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Ken Herbert : Congratulations, Howard. Phebe, I just wanted to dig into Marine again a little deeper. The full year guide implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth into the back half of the year. Two questions, really. First, as we go back six months, you were talking about a much more conservative outlook for the top line in Marine. And clearly, maybe any comments on really what\u2019s changed because the first half has really been much stronger than expected. But then also, as you think about the remainder of the year, what will drive the significant step down and how much conservatism does the Marine outlook reflect in terms of the growth? Phebe Novakovic : So, growth in the quarter was driven by improved -- increased volume on Columbia and on the oiler program as well as additional throughput throughout each one of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. And finally, just the -- revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. And that will drive our expectations. With respect to the margin performance, we have -- Columbia is doing very well. We\u2019ve got nice performance on the oiler. We see some deck plate improvements of Bath, but that has yet to translate into financial performance. Electric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. And with respect to that supply chain, we see improvements and some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID. And I think a little bit of explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, Virginia supply chain, in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously, the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover. And finally, Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They\u2019re getting better, but we\u2019ve got a while to go before they hit their two-a-year or more cadence. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Peter Arment : Thank you. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Congrats, Howard. Hey Phebe, within Combat, munitions kind of is viewed as a potential source of kind of upside volume, and thanks for all the color on the segment. But how should we be thinking about the munitions growth profile? I mean, it\u2019s about -- finished last year, about 27% of your mix. Do you expect that mix to continue to grow? And any comments on the supply chain there as my follow-up, just because I know there\u2019s been talk about challenges there. Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : The supply chain in the Combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that the -- at least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about that, same as we see uplift in all of our all three businesses. We\u2019ll see OTS at about that same level. We\u2019ve already increased munitions capacity and working with the federal government and the Army and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left, the munition availability to meet the United States\u2019 needs and, frankly, external needs as well. Howard Rubel : Operator, we\u2019ll just take one more question, please. Operator : And our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. I didn\u2019t figure I\u2019d outlast you, but we\u2019ve known each other a lot of years and... Howard Rubel : George, it\u2019s over 40, just counting. George Shapiro : That\u2019s right. Phebe, on the defaults that you mentioned, can you just mention what kind of customers they might have been? And I assume you keep the down-payments that might have been made on the aircraft that they order? Phebe Novakovic : So I think you know we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit some of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don\u2019t actually know the context of the default, that won\u2019t -- nothing that was of note or interest, otherwise, I\u2019d know it. George Shapiro : Okay. And Jason, the unbilled receivables was actually up like $100 million sequentially. So, does that mean you didn\u2019t get any payments from the expected customers in the quarter? And how much would you expect the rest of the year to come in? Jason Aiken : Actually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I\u2019m actually happy to tell you that at this point -- and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future. The arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian international program has now effectively been paid down, and we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program. So I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve passed through that phase. In terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year, there are some more progress payments to come in, but I don\u2019t have that quantified off the top of my head. George Shapiro : Something you had kind of given what the specifics were on that in the Q. Howard Rubel : We\u2019ll follow up on that. Jason Aiken : Yes. Howard Rubel : Operator, that now ends the call. And for those that are interested in connecting later, we\u2019ll have follow-up questions. Please don\u2019t hesitate to call me. Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. And as I said, if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On the call today are Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. With the introductions complete, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jason. Jason Aiken : Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. The first thing I\u2019ll note is that our Chairman and CEO, Phebe Novakovic, is under the weather today, so I\u2019ll be conducting today\u2019s call along with Bill.  Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.04 per diluted share on revenue of $10.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.06 billion and net income of $836 million. Revenue was up $596 million or 6% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $41 million or 3.7%. Net earnings were down $66 million and earnings per share were down 6.7%. The quarter-over-quarter results show significant growth in revenue but a 100 basis point contraction in operating margin. On the other hand, sequential results are quite good across the board. Here, we beat last quarter\u2019s revenue by 4.1%, operating earnings by 9.9%, net earnings by 12.4%, and EPS by 12.6%. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.13 per share on higher revenue and better operating earnings than anticipated. Operating margin is about the same as expected. The beat came almost entirely from operations. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 7.2%, operating earnings were down less than 1%, and diluted earnings per share were down 2.6%. We had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.32 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which is 131% of net earnings. This follows very good cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter in all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream and the marine segment. You\u2019ll hear more detail on cash and backlog, as well as some of the other financial particulars from Bill in just a minute. In short, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of the supply chain and program mix headwinds that time will cure, so let me move right ahead with some color around the performance of the business segments. First, aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.03 billion and operating earnings of $268 million with a 13.2% operating margin. Revenue was down $315 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer deliveries at Gulfstream due to supply chain constraints. Operating earnings were down $44 million on lower revenue and a 10 basis point contraction in margin. The sequential comparison is much better - revenue was up $79 million or 4%, and operating earnings were up $32 million or 13.6% on 110 basis point improvement in margin. There were 27 deliveries in the quarter, three more than in the second quarter. To provide some additional color here, Gulfstream has made 72 aircraft deliveries through the end of the quarter. We are on track to deliver between 40 and 45 currently in-service aircraft in the fourth quarter. All-in including G700s, we anticipate in excess of 60 deliveries in the quarter, assuming we\u2019re granted FAA certification before the end of the year. That said, as you can tell, there\u2019s a considerable amount of uncertainty as we get closer to certification. Moving to the demand environment, this was yet another positive quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.4 to 1, and Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.5 to 1. We continue to have vibrant sales activity going into the fourth quarter and expect strong orders. It would, however, be a stretch to get to 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter, given our expectation of over 60 deliveries. A wildcard in the quarter will be the conflict in Israel and its impact on demand, if any. The period of significant increased aircraft demand began in mid-February of 2021, over two and a half years ago. In 2021, Gulfstream\u2019s book-to-bill was 1.7 to 1, in \u201922 it was 1.5 to 1, and year-to-date 2023 it\u2019s 1.3 to 1. This includes the first quarter of 2023, when there was a three-week hiatus in orders as a result of the failure of several regional banks. In that quarter, we still managed a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill. All of this leads quite naturally to an astonishing build of the aerospace backlog. It grew from $11.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $20.1 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023, an increase of over 70% in two and three-quarter years. This all speaks to me of the underlying strength of the market for our products. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to move closer to its ultimate conclusion. We continue to plan for certification in the fourth quarter of this year, largely dependent upon the availability of FAA resources and a credit the FAA may allow for company flying. We currently are spending most of our engineering time on final reports and data submission. Operationally, Gulfstream continues to make good progress under difficult circumstances, but as a result of the supply chain issues that we\u2019ve previously discussed, we plan to deliver 10 to 12 fewer aircraft this year than the 145 we had originally forecast in the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we continue to expect more service revenue than initially predicted. Next, combat systems. Combat systems had revenue of $2.22 billion, up a stunning 24.4% over the year-ago quarter with growth at each of the business units, but particularly at OTS and European land systems. Earnings were $300 million, which was up 10.7%. Margins at 13.5% represent 170 basis point reduction versus the year-ago quarter, so once again we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margins in large part attributable to mix and new program starts. Some of our revenue increase is a result of facilities contracts to increase our artillery production capacity taken at lower margin. As you\u2019d expect, these contracts will result in additional production at accretive margins over time. On the subject of munitions, we\u2019re working very closely with our government customer and have accelerated production faster than planned. The large capacity expansion that we\u2019re putting in place today will further increase production. We have a ways to go, but we\u2019re making progress. The increase in combat revenue also came from new international vehicle programs, the ramp-up of the M10 Booker, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha and Eagle vehicles in Europe. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $300 million or 15.6%, and earnings were up $49 million or 19.5% on a 50 basis point improvement in margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up $775 million or 15.1% and operating earnings were up $53 million or 7.1% over last year, so the numbers are quite impressive quarter-over-quarter, sequentially and year-to-date. Combat systems experienced very good order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a one-to-one book-to-bill, a very strong performance given the increased revenue and evidencing strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill is 1.3 to 1, which fully supports the growth outlook. Turning to marine systems, once again our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine systems revenue of $3 billion was up $233 million or 8.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering drove the growth. Operating earnings were $211 million, down $27 million versus the year-ago quarter with 160 basis point decrement in operating margin. The year-ago quarter had a number of favorable EAC adjustments which did not repeat this quarter. Sequentially, both revenue and operating earnings were down somewhat. Importantly, year-to-date revenue was up $982 million, 12.2%; however, earnings were essentially flat on a 90 basis point contraction in operating margin. The real driver of the margin difficulty has been the late deliveries at Electric Boat from the supply chain, which causes out-of-station work and internal scheduling disruptions. Electric Boat has continued to improve its throughput, but not fast enough to offset the cost of late material. We continue with the help of the Navy to work this issue. At Bath, while we\u2019re seeing signs of improved productivity, it has yet to manifest in the business\u2019 financial performance. All that said, we\u2019re looking for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time. Importantly, marine systems enjoyed a very good quarter from an orders perspective with a 2.3 to 1 book-to-bill. This is a very large enduring backlog. Lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is up 8% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong first half of the year. That growth was spread pretty evenly between GDIT and mission systems; in fact, each business grew both year-over-year and sequentially. At GDIT, we\u2019re seeing particular strength in the defense and federal civilian portfolios as our technology accelerator investments and capabilities like zero trust, artificial intelligence, digital engineering and 5G are really resonating with customers and driving increased demand.  At mission systems, the cyber and naval platform markets have been particularly strong. The production and delivery cadence on the hardware side appears to have stabilized, so we expect their results to be somewhat more predictable despite the lingering fragility in the supply chain that will continue to be the new normal. Based on the strength of the first three quarters, the group is on track to achieve our increased sales forecast of $12.7 billion for the year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $315 million, up 10.5%, yielding a margin of 9.5% - that\u2019s up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially, so a very solid performance on strong revenue growth in the quarter. This is a drumbeat we expect to see continue in the fourth quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.7 billion. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1 to 1, keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. Prospects remain strong with a qualified funnel of over $125 billion in opportunities they\u2019re pursuing across the portfolio. Let me close with a review of the defense units in aggregate. As a whole on a quarter-over-quarter basis, defense had revenue of $8.54 billion, up $911 million or 11.9% over the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, earnings of $826 million were up $32 million or 4%. On a sequential basis, the pattern is similar - revenue was up $340 million or 4.1% and earnings were up $57 million or 7.4%. Year-to-date against the same period last year, revenue of $24.7 billion was up 10.2% and operating earnings were up $60 million or 2.6%. In short, our defense businesses are experiencing significant growth in revenue and to a lesser degree in earnings; however, we need to continue to work with our supply chain in order to achieve appropriate operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Bill. Bill Moss : Thank you Jason, and good morning. We had another very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 to 1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Marine systems and aerospace led the way with book-to-bill ratios of 2.3 and 1.4 respectively. For the second quarter in a row, this led to record level backlog of $95.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up 4.6% from last quarter and up 7.6% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter just shy of $133 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another strong story in the quarter with over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. This brings us to $3.5 billion of operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, or 126% of net income through the first nine months. This conversion rate was achieved on the strength of the Gulfstream orders, additional scheduled progress payment on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. We are well positioned to achieve our target for the year of a cash conversion rate over 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter, or 2.1% of sales. For the first nine months, we\u2019re at 2% of sales. We\u2019re still targeting to be slightly below 2.5% of sales for the full year, so that implies an uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We paid $363 million in dividends and repurchased a little over a quarter million shares during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months to $1.5 billion. We also repaid $500 million of debt that matured in August and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.3 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down nearly $1.4 billion from year end. Net interest expense in the quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $265 million, down from $279 million for the same period in 2022.  Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 16.2%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth, so no change to our outlook of 17% for the full year, which again implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Jason for some final remarks. Jason Aiken : Thanks Bill. As far as year-end guidance is concerned, we\u2019re holding at $12.65 for the year. There will be a number of puts and takes from what we published last quarter, but it should all come about the same place. Nicole, that will conclude our remarks, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to you. Nicole Shelton : Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Jason, it sounds like there\u2019s just obviously a lot of moving parts for Q4 at Gulfstream. Is there a cut-off date, you know, if certification happens in December versus November, about your ability to kind of push out those deliveries, and then any commentary on just--I know you\u2019ve had a long term forecast of 170 deliveries for \u201924, whether you still think that holds. Obviously if certification slips, there would be more potentially, but maybe just some commentary there. Thanks. Jason Aiken : Yes, thanks Peter. As it relates to certification, I think what we\u2019ve said for some time now is that if we can achieve certification in the, call it early to mid December time frame, then we\u2019ve got a good shot at getting the planned deliveries of G700s out the door this year. Obviously if that pushes further to the right, that puts that a little bit at risk. To your point about 2024, it\u2019s probably not appropriate to get into specifics about next year until we go through our plan period, which we\u2019ll engage in coming up here in the next month or two, but I think the way to think about this is a lot of what we\u2019ve been talking about this year between the supply chain challenges, as well as the G700 cert timing, is really timing issues, and to your point, to the extent some of the deliveries that we anticipated this year don\u2019t happen, that really just pushes into next year, so that naturally is an adder to the outlook for 2024.  But what we can\u2019t do yet is declare victory on the supply chain issues and say that by early next year, they\u2019re going to be completely solved, so a lot remains to be seen as to the timing of how that ultimately works itself out. I think it\u2019s that that will determine the net impact to 2024, so I think a little bit more time is going to be needed to see between what pushes out of 2023 into 2024 and the timing of the supply chain fix, what the net impact is to that \u201924 outlook. I think we\u2019ll have a better sense of that when we come back to you with guidance in January. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color, thanks Jason. Operator : We will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning. Jason Aiken : Good morning David. David Strauss : Hey. Jason, at the beginning of the year, you guys had forecasted marine and combat to be relatively flat. At this point, we\u2019re looking at probably double-digit growth for both of those businesses this year. Does any of that--as we start thinking about how those businesses could look next year, does any of this represent any sort of pull-forward that would potentially moderate the growth that we could see out of those two businesses next year? Jason Aiken : Yes, so I think as it relates to marine systems, David, nothing has really fundamentally changed from the narrative that we\u2019ve talked about for some time, which is to expect roughly $400 million to $500 million on average per year, year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously this year has turned out to be quite a bit different than we originally anticipated, and that\u2019s largely attributable to the increased throughput that we\u2019ve seen at Electric Boat in particular as the hiring and retention dynamics have really improved faster than we thought, so that\u2019s really driven a lot of the revenue acceleration into this year. That backlog is so large and so long term, I don\u2019t really see that having a direct effect on next year or any given year, but obviously again we\u2019ll have to go through the specific planning period that we\u2019re about to engage in before we get too specific about next year, so we\u2019ll be back with more on that, but not a direct correlation in my mind from that marine systems increase in throughput. On combat systems, to your point, we had been expecting sort of flat to down-ish revenue before the threat environment really took a turn in the opposite direction, and as you\u2019ve seen through the first part of the year, up 15% so far year-to-date, almost 25% in the quarter - that certainly was well beyond what our original expectations were, and frankly we don\u2019t see that demand signal slowing down. When you think about the munitions side of the business as well as the international demand we\u2019re seeing, along with the new program starts in the U.S., I don\u2019t necessarily see that as being a pull forward or something that creates a headwind into 2024. Again, not being specific about that outlook because we\u2019ll get into the planning period and get back to you in January. David Strauss : As a follow-up, the IRS came out with updated guidance on Section 174 R&D. What impact does that have on your cash flow outlook? Jason Aiken : Really, nothing other than what we\u2019ve told you before. We\u2019ve actually been pretty consistent on this throughout the drama on this issue over the years. We didn\u2019t originally anticipate the law to be changed, so our guidance was predicated on the law as it is. It turned out not to be changed, and our expectation of what that would mean for us, ultimately you can call it lucky or good, we expected the net impact from a cash perspective to be right on course with what we\u2019re seeing right now. Operator : We will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ken Herbert : Yes, hi. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Maybe just to start, Jason, again on Gulfstream. Last quarter, you called out sort of 19 as the expected 700 delivery number, depending upon cert timing this year. Is that still a number we should expect into the fourth quarter, assuming you get certification in time, and can you just comment on any potential risk around 280 production levels, considering some of the uncertainty in the Middle East? Jason Aiken : Yes, so far as the G700 is concerned, 19 is the number that we have targeted and are still striving to get to. Again, as you note, that is predicated on timing of cert. What I can tell you in terms of a little bit of color behind that is we\u2019ve got 15 of those 19 that are ready to go and are in good shape, and we\u2019re working toward the others, so again predicated on when the cert comes, we should be in good shape to be somewhere in that range for deliveries this year. As it relates to the 280s, what I would tell you is the modest down-tick that we--that I talked about earlier this morning in terms of our overall 2024--excuse me, 2023 deliveries, that five or six aircraft reduction from our previous guidance in July, that is largely related to G280s. I would tell you that what we planned to deliver this year, we now have in hand at our Dallas facility for completion, so there\u2019s really not any incremental risk to 2023. We will have to see, obviously, how the events in Israel play out and what impact that may have in 2024, but a little premature to get into that at this point. Ken Herbert : Okay, great. Thanks Jason. Jason Aiken : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Robert Stallard : Thanks very much, good morning. Jason Aiken : Morning Rob. Robert Stallard : Jason, on the supply chain, maybe I\u2019m just reading too much into this, it sounds as if it actually got a bit worse than what you talked about last quarter, so I wonder if you can elaborate on what you\u2019ve been seeing, whether there are any specific pinch points that are causing you trouble. Jason Aiken : Rob, I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re talking about supply chain in aerospace, and if so, I would tell you that actually we\u2019re seeing modest signs throughout the quarter that things are actually getting better. It\u2019s not, as you\u2019d imagine, a straight line to the finish line on this issue, so there will be some bumps in the road and some curves along the way, but things are starting to trend better. What we saw here was a specific issue in terms of, as I mentioned, G280s in terms of the reduced in-service aircraft production, but on the large cabin aircraft, we are starting to see things trend in the right direction, so I think it\u2019s a little bit maybe in the other direction of what your intuition is pointing you to. Robert Stallard : Okay, good to hear. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could elaborate on where you stand on supply chain in, I think, mission systems had a few issues, and also in the labor situation at marine, that that seems to have improved. Jason Aiken : Sorry, it broke up there, Rob, at the end. You said mission systems supply chain and then labor--? Robert Stallard : At marine. Jason Aiken : Oh, labor at marine - okay. On the mission systems side, I feel very good about what they\u2019ve done. The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect it to remain what I\u2019d call fragile. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future, but the fact is the team at mission systems has fully incorporated that new reality into their outlook, and so I expect their future to be a lot more stable and predictable as they\u2019ve incorporated the new normal, if you will, on supply chain on the electronic side for them. In terms of the labor side on marine systems, as I mentioned earlier, I think we\u2019ve seen stabilization in both attraction and retention of labor in the shipyards at a faster rate than we anticipated, so that\u2019s an encouraging sign. That drives the throughput in the yard, and over time as those new shipbuilders become more tenured, more experienced, more proficient, we would expect at that point, that\u2019s one of the factors that will really drive over time the margin improvement in the shipyard, so it\u2019s an encouraging start for them. We\u2019ve just got to see that play out, because as you know, shipbuilding is a long term venture. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Jason Aiken : Morning. Scott Deuschle : Jason, can you walk through some of the high level puts and takes for aerospace incremental margins next year, and I guess maybe to ask another way, are the right things to focus on from our perspective the G700 mix, less out-of-sequence work, the learning curve on G700, and then presumably R&D either leveling off or coming down, or is there anything else here that we should be considering? Thank you. Jason Aiken : I\u2019d say you nailed most of the high level items there for next year, and again the G700 is a bit piece of it. Obviously we\u2019ve talked about how that will come into service with favorable entry level margins, accretive entry level margins for the group, so that\u2019s a big driver. I think the other major one, and you alluded to it, really is the resolution and straightening out of the supply chain issues. One of the things Gulfstream has really worked towards here and planned towards, I think very effectively and we\u2019ll see it over time, is driving the efficiency of the operation with this new family of aircraft. Between the facilities that have been built, the commonality between the airplanes, the ability to service those airplanes efficiently, that is really what we are driving towards and one of the major underpinnings behind the long term trajectory back to the mid to high teens margins for that group. Obviously timing of when those things get straightened out in the supply chain will be important, because that\u2019s really what\u2019s sort of inhibiting us getting to that point of efficiency.  We will see a little bit of modest down-tick in R&D - I wouldn\u2019t call that a major factor, but you should expect to see that tick down a little as we finish up the 700 this year and get through the 800 next year, but again, have 800 and 400 to go, so we\u2019re not out of things yet from an R&D standpoint there. Those are the major puts and takes, I\u2019d say. All in all, we would expect to see revenue--or excuse me, margin continuing on its trajectory again toward that mid to high teens rate. We\u2019ll see improvement here in the fourth quarter, and I expect to see good improvement in 2024. Scott Deuschle : Okay, great. Then as a follow-up, are there any major company-funded growth capex projects still underway in \u201924 and \u201925, or is most of that complete this year? If it does complete this year, does the nearly billion dollars of capex included in current Bloomberg incentives for \u201924 and \u201925 make directional sense, because that\u2019s basically still in line with \u201923, I think? Thank you. Jason Aiken : Yes, the major internal capex projects are done this year. We\u2019ve got a little bit of trailing cost and activity going on in the shipyards as we finish out that capacity expansion, particularly at Electric Boat, but that will wrap up next year. The investments we\u2019re making on the Army side from an artillery perspective, that\u2019s being funded by the customer, and so bottom line, we ought to see our capex level trend back towards 2%. We\u2019ll be below 2.5% this year, which is directionally headed the right way, and we\u2019ll be back toward--if not at 2%, headed toward 2% next year. Operator : We will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning Jason and Bill. Maybe first on the president\u2019s $106 billion supplemental request, it includes $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. With this request out there now and with respect to AUKUS, can you talk more about what this means for GD? Does this change timing at all? Jason Aiken : Bottom line, Kristine, I think the short answer is no. Obviously any additional support that can be provided in terms of that supplemental or other funding to shore up the industrial base is helpful. There\u2019s a lot of talk around AUKUS and obviously we\u2019re going to do everything we can to support our customer in that regard, but the fact is this supply chain still remains very fragile. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to get this whole industry back to--from a submarine perspective, back to two per year. We\u2019ve got to get to that point on Virginia while delivering Columbias, and I think we\u2019ve got some more work to do to get there, and so any additional funding and support, whether it\u2019s through the supplemental or other Navy support, would be extremely helpful, but that\u2019s our focus today, is to get to that two per year plus Columbia, and then we\u2019ll look to AUKUS beyond that. Kristine Liwag : Following up on your comments on the fragile supply chain, has there been changes in your contracting terms with the customer to reflect this, and how do we think about long term margins? Jason Aiken : I think the main way this has been reflected in our contracting with the customer is to recognize the impacts that we\u2019ve had and to price that in, and accommodate what is this current state of affairs in our contracting. One example of that is the DDG multi-year that we just saw awarded in the quarter - we feel like that\u2019s been appropriately considered there, and we\u2019ll continue to consider the state that the industry is in as we go forward. I wouldn\u2019t point to necessarily any other macro or overarching contract structures or other terms that have changed. In terms of margins, we expect them to get better, frankly. My expectation is that this quarter would be the trough for the group. We expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect to see modest sequential incremental improvement over time in this group. That said, this is a challenging task. Shipbuilding is a challenging endeavor and so it\u2019s not going to be straightforward, but our expectation, to be completely straightforward, is to have gradual increasing margins in this group over time as we march back toward that 8% to 9%-plus margin range. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much, and good morning everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on that last topic. The Q3 margin in marine, similar to Q1. In Q1, we know there were some charges on Virginia, I believe Block 4 and Block 5. Were there significant negative EACs on Virginia in the third quarter that drove the margin that we ended up seeing, and I guess any--I know you talked about supply chain at Electric Boat, but any additional color about what assumptions have really changed there, and with the new assumptions, how that affects your ability to expand margins? Jason Aiken : In the quarter, Seth, nothing material in terms of EACs in the quarter. What you\u2019re seeing there, obviously we are still experiencing pressure from delayed material coming out of the supply chain that\u2019s affecting Electric Boat\u2019s schedule and delivery and man hour in the yard. But the other implication that you\u2019re seeing is having reduced the margin rates through the earlier EAC adjustments, we\u2019re now seeing the aggregate impact of that in the booking rates that we are recognizing on the programs today, so it\u2019s sort of the aggregate confluence of all those factors are driving the margin rate that you see in the quarter. But again, as we start to continue to improve the throughput and improve the efficiency in the yards, we do expect to see incremental improvement in the margin, starting in the fourth quarter. In terms of supply chain changes, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s anything changing. I think it\u2019s as we go to contract, we have 2020 hindsight, or full visibility if you will, into the current state of affairs, and so we\u2019re working through that with our customer and they understand the situation we\u2019re in, so we\u2019re basically incorporating the current state of the supply chain, as well as the implications of increasing cost of skilled labor as you\u2019ve seen with a lot of the labor negotiations going on out in the market. It\u2019s those types of factors that are being incorporated, that we\u2019re putting into the new contracts and that we feel like will put us in a good position to perform from a margin perspective as we look ahead. Seth Seifman : Okay, okay, thanks. Then just for clarification, when you talked about at the overall company and despite some changes, the EPS outlook being unchanged, was that sort of--that was based on that new Gulfstream delivery outlook that you talked about with the 60-plus in Q4. If the G700 wasn\u2019t to be certified this year, I assume that that\u2019s kind of a different story, and what\u2019s the last date roughly that you could see that certification happen and still deliver, I don\u2019t know, double-digit G700s? Jason Aiken : Yes, so the EPS reaffirmed at $12.65 is based on the updated Gulfstream delivery number that I mentioned earlier. As I said, that\u2019s mostly--the reduced number from the July outlook is mostly associated with G280s, so not as significant an earnings impact to that. As you can imagine, some puts and takes, none of which are particularly material, across the rest of the portfolio, including some upward pressure across the defense businesses from a revenue perspective, as you might imagine, improved, customer service revenue at the aerospace group and so on, some below-the-line things like lower interest expense and share count, net-net kind of putting us in the same place, so that\u2019s sort of why the guidance stays where it is. In terms of the 700 outlook, I think the key issue is, and the question so many people around why the uncertainty, is we don\u2019t have a date certain. This is the FAA\u2019s process. We need to let them go through that process. We are supporting them in that process. They\u2019re going through flying now and we\u2019re doing the necessary paperwork and reporting to support that, and so we have a path, we have an expectation to get there in early to mid-December, but there\u2019s not a red line or a date certain on the calendar that we\u2019re looking at, at this point. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open. Doug Harned : Good morning, thank you. Jason Aiken : Morning Doug. Doug Harned : I wanted to go back to marine because when you look at Electric Boat, and your backlogs have been--have built way up, as you mentioned, the Navy wants to be at two VCS deliveries per year, can you describe, like, what scenarios you can even look at here? I mean, my understand it\u2019s about 1.2 now, it\u2019s way off what clearly Congress wants, what the Navy wants. Are there scenarios that you think about in terms of how soon in a good situation we might get to that two per year, or what would be a negative scenario? What\u2019s the range of outcomes here? Jason Aiken : No, you point out the landscape appropriately, Doug. I think the way I think about that is prior to COVID, if you look at the couple quarters leading up to 2020, we were--as a team, we were right on the threshold of getting to two per year on the Virginia-class program, so it is imminently doable in terms of the industrial base and the team that\u2019s working that program. Obviously COVID set us on our heels, as well as the generational changeover in shipbuilders in terms of retirements and new hires. I think the way to think about that now is there\u2019s a number of factors that are going to help us get back to that point. One is, again, the maturing and tenuring of that new workforce to get the efficiency in the workforce, to get us back to where we were. The investments that the Navy is making in the industrial base, which are extremely helpful to stabilize that, and then other initiatives like what we call strategic sourcing, where we\u2019re trying to take bottlenecks out of the shipyards and move subsystem construction and capacity into other facilities and other yards around the country, so that we can take some of the pressure off of the two main production and assembly yards. Those are the types of things that are going to drive us back toward two per year. I\u2019d be remiss to try and give you a timeline on when it\u2019s going to be to get there - this is long term, challenging stuff, but I think with us and our partner and the Navy all working in the same direction and in a very strong partnership, I feel optimistic about our path to get there. Doug Harned : Then as a follow-up, if you add one more factor into this, which is Columbia class, obviously in a very different stage in the program, but also you\u2019ve got an overlapping supply chain. How does progress on the Columbia class right now look, and how does that affect your ability to push forward on this VCS ramp? Jason Aiken : Yes, Columbia, as you know, is the Navy\u2019s and the DoD\u2019s number one priority, so that\u2019s going to continue to be the case. I don\u2019t see that being a trade-off necessarily to get to two per year for Virginia. Right now, we\u2019re a little over 40% complete on the first boat, and we\u2019re right on schedule for the targeted completion of that first boat. We\u2019ve still got obviously about four years to go before delivery, so a lot of the way to go and a lot can happen between now and then, but all the resources that can be brought to bear are on that priority. I think the way to think about it is because of its priority position, it is essentially a headwind to those other factors that I gave you about what we\u2019re trying to do on Virginia class, and we\u2019ve got to be able to manage both of those within the yard and within the team arrangement and with our customer, but those are some of the puts and takes. Columbia will be the priority, and it\u2019s our job to make Virginia happen notwithstanding that priority. Operator : We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much, and good quarter. Jason, you said you\u2019re still looking for 12.7 in technologies, but when I look at all of your defense numbers, you really beat in revenues across the board, so maybe if you can--you know, if I look at where the model was before, it looks like we have a softer fourth quarter to get us home, but that doesn\u2019t seem realistic given the spectacular revenues you had here in the third quarter, so maybe update us, if you could, on where you\u2019re looking for revenues in each of the defense sectors for the year, and should we feel a bigger step-up next year? Jason Aiken : I think the way to think about the fourth quarter, Cai, is as I alluded to earlier, there is obviously some upward pressure on the revenue on the defense side, nothing to get too specific about and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s particularly material with just a couple months to go here in the year.  But one way to think about this is this year, let\u2019s talk group by group, in technologies you may remember, last year we had a significant surge in the fourth quarter because we had had a big back-up on the supply chain side at mission systems through the third quarter, and a lot of that flowed through in the fourth quarter, so really a big hockey stick or upswing in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s not the pattern this year. As I mentioned before, they\u2019ve been on a more regular order and a more regular drumbeat, and so we\u2019ll see a more steady state revenue pattern for technologies in the fourth quarter. In combat, likewise it\u2019s historically for some time now been the traditional seasonal pattern for combat to rise throughout the year and have its biggest quarter in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again last year. In this case in 2023, it\u2019s a much more steady drumbeat - again, steady demand, strong volume, but not the traditional seasonal fourth quarter uptick in combat.  In marine, again we\u2019ve already seen tremendous volume well in excess of our expectations. We\u2019re up a billion dollars almost through the first nine months, which is roughly what we expected for the year, so again I\u2019d say more stable quarter to quarter. To summarize, we\u2019re seeing more stable volumes across all three of the defense segments from first quarter to fourth quarter, whereas in the past they\u2019ve risen from first to fourth, so a little bit of an aberration in the pattern. I do expect--again, not to get ahead of the planning process we\u2019re going through, but I expect each of the businesses to show growth going into next year. Can\u2019t get too much more specific about that at this point, but you should see growth in the defense business across all three of the segments going into 2024. Cai von Rumohr : Very helpful, and then maybe a quick comment on Israel - Hamas has created additional demand, we have this $106 billion request from the President. Can you give us some general color in terms of areas where you think you could see incremental acceleration in demand? Jason Aiken : You know, the Israel situation obviously is a terrible one, frankly, and one that\u2019s just evolving as we speak. But I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that, the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side. Obviously that\u2019s been a big pressure point up to now with Ukraine, one that we\u2019ve been doing everything we can to support our Army customer. We\u2019ve gone from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We\u2019re working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month, and I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand, so that\u2019s the biggest stick-out that I can see. Nicole Shelton : Abbie, I think we have time for just one more question. Operator : Excellent, thank you. We will take our final question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning. Jason Aiken : Morning Ron. Ron Epstein : Maybe just two. On land systems, given truly the surge in demand relative to where everybody thought it would be, from a capacity point of view, from a labor point of view, how are you guys set up there to handle it all? Jason Aiken : You know, I have to give a hand to the guys in the combat systems group in general, and land systems specifically. You\u2019ve really not heard us talk about supply chain bottlenecks, labor capacity or other issues in that group, and that does not mean they have not faced them, they are just--they stand out amongst even a spectacular crowd in the way they\u2019ve handled it. I don\u2019t have any expectation that we\u2019ll see any issues as we look ahead, even as the demand for their product, both domestically as well as internationally, continues to grow. Ron Epstein : Then maybe just changing gears a bit, nobody really asked a heck of a lot about GDIT. Jason Aiken : Thank you for that - finally! Ron Epstein : Let\u2019s talk about that, it\u2019s a big piece of the company, right? You know a lot about it in particular. When we think about a path to double-digit margins, how do we get there, and then maybe from an operational point of view, why does not integrating mission and GDIT together kind of make sense, because there\u2019s this bigger demand for software-driven solutions and software and hardware, and you\u2019re seeing this synergy coming out particularly with the application of AI to legacy systems, and so on and so forth. Jason Aiken : On the margin side, just to be clear, as I think about double-digit margin for the group, not specifically GDIT - it\u2019s the mix of the two of them together, I absolutely expect this group to be on the march back to low double-digit margin. It\u2019s where they\u2019ve been historically. I think if anything I could articulate as a headwind to that, it\u2019s to the extent that the GDIT side grows faster than the mission systems side, that obviously creates a bit of a macro mix issue that could be a little bit of a headwind in terms of how long it takes us to get there. But frankly, I expect to see us get back into the double-digit margin range here in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ll see how quickly we can get there in the outlook as we look at \u201924 and beyond, but I do expect them to get back on the trajectory toward low double-digit margin. In terms of integration, the way we see this is while they\u2019re very symbiotic businesses and they are dealing with a market that\u2019s dealing with a convergence, to your point in terms of their capabilities, we think that having them separate is appropriate because the investment thesis and the way you run an inherently people business versus an inherently technology development, hardware and production business, are fundamentally different and take different leadership, different priorities and sort of different investment theses.  The good news is that by having them together in the same group and in a coordinated way, we are making investments and addressing the evolving technologies jointly as a group, and we are making sure we are being efficient at that and effective at that, not duplicative, not missing anything, and bringing the requisite skills, to your point, from end to end, whether it\u2019s the hardware side, the services, the software capabilities, solutions as a service, software services and so on, together in joint capability. I think we get the best of both worlds that way in terms of the way we manage and run the businesses, but also the way we can bring combined capabilities to the customer set. Nicole Shelton : Great.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nicole Shelton : Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11,668,000,000, operating earnings of $1,288,000,000, and net earnings of $1,000,000,000. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06, or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favourably, particularly revenue and operating earnings. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1,097,000, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million, or 21.9%, net earnings by $169 million or 20.2%, and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3%, and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8%, and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease, mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. The fourth quarter in the year are $0.04 and $0.09 respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus lowered during the two weeks before this earnings release, as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year end. As a result, Gulfstream was unable to deliver 15 G700s as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity, and backlog, and any other items you might like to address. Jason Aiken : Thank you, Phoebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up $2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7 times in the fourth quarter and one-to-one for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the year, and all four segments were one-to-one or better. Turning to our cash performance, it was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on Combat Systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with two million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million. Turning to income taxes, we had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Jason. First, aerospace; the story in aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business, and the continuing growth of jet aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter. For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of $1.18 billion, improved by $52 million on a 50-basis point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter in the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us of slightly over a billion dollars of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures. We were also unable during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted. In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter. All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.2 times for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially and $938 million for the year. So, aerospace demand remained strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and jet aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event. I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resultant conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the New Year, the sales pipeline remained strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get to guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year. Next, combat systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at ordnance and tactical systems and European land systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of piranhas, bridges and eagles in Europe, and new international tank programs. Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million or 6.3% and earnings are up $51 million or 17% on the strength of 130 basis point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, combat had a very good year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill, driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particular strength in Europe. By the way, combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up $72 million or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Turning to marine, the powerful marine system's growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,408,000,000 is up 14.8% over the year ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially, and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia class construction and engineering volume, TAO volume, and service contracts at bat. Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year ago quarter on a 160 basis point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at electric boats. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors, later than promised material to EB [ph], which drove additional out of station work at EB, and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine Systems had a one-time book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion. Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024. Jason Aiken : The Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments; defense, intel, and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%, and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance, to break it down between the two businesses, GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for mission systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a logjam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products, lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full-year basis are quite favorable. With respect to order activity and backlog, the technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a one-to-one book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totalling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest. Mission systems had a great year as well, with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog. So much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion, and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion; so all in all, a great year for the technologies group. Phebe Novakovic : So let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2024, we expect aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier. As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter, and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges. In combat systems at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is the result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe. To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the Marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024. In technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, emissions systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long term low single digit growth for the group and continued industry leading margins. So for 2024 company wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 billion to $46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11% up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40. A reasonable range would be $14.35 billion to $14.45 billion. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike with very strong third and fourth quarters. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we will be laser focused on operations. Nicole, back to you. Nicole Shelton : Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, I was hoping you could touch on the 700, not a surprise. How many do you have ready for pre-delivery inspection from your customers and also, relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place, I mean, this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to go through their process. I'm just curious, your confidence level for first quarter delivery versus, say, where you were in the fourth quarter expecting deliveries by year end? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So we have 15 airplanes ready to go and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could around the certification and where we are. Myles Walton : Is there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for '24? Phebe Novakovic : So we're not going to go into what we've assumed for any given airplane in our guidance. So let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last about eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have no control and it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule. Myles Walton : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America. Ron Epstein : Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason. Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base, the DOD has been making some big investments. Now, where do you see Virginia-class build rates ultimately getting, Columbia, too, because it just seems like the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, we're just under-capacitized. So, any thoughts on that? Phebe Novakovic : So let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses and industry and an entire supply chain and manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had a really stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those won't remedy, but there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely sufficient capacity at the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment, but should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to the stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality and that happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited from Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still they need to come down their learning curves and they're doing so nicely. I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24% and about 30% on Columbia. So Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity, so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain and that helps the entire supply chain plan. Ron Epstein : Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitized enough to meet the demand that AUKUS would require, having an extra Virginia class every three years? Phebe Novakovic : So I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy, but let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. That's one step at a time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup. Jason Gursky : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft. I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the New Year. Phebe Novakovic : So the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market and so we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service. Jason Gursky : Okay, great. And then your comments on combat and the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, that doesn't sound like it's implied in your guidance, but I'm just kind of curious that how far into the year can we go to get those orders and actually convert them into revenue? Phebe Novakovic : Well, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So we factored to the best of our ability the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So the extent that there is upside, it'll be I think largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate and to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we had -- look in all cases, we give you a very balanced I'd say, 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time. Operator : We'll go next to Davis Strauss at Barclays. Davis Strauss : Phoebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for '24 might actually play out here given that we're quickly approaching, the potential for a sequester? Phebe Novakovic : So we have factored in all known funding into our plan and should we see an extensive and continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently and to the extent that we have a sequester then we have factored some of that, but apparently, clearly you can't do all of it into your plan. So we'll adjust accordingly, but we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times given the threat environment. Davis Strauss : Okay. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment. Maybe help with some of the big movie pieces, obviously inventory was a big drag, but advances helped a lot. Your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in, in '24 and I assume your guidance includes nothing as usual for capital deployment. How should we think about that given you have very little in maturities this year? Thanks. Jason Aiken : Yeah, so when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit. We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years, but right now if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the aerospace group a fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion. When you think about it, we got a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So that more than offset any effective inventory build. So as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady one-to-one book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion plus or minus for that business. Combat systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So that'll continue for a couple of years. The technologies group is a steady provider, well above 100% conversion and the marine systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now and we'll see what the future holds as Phebe alluded to in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision and we'll look at all options as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment and that factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. So if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front. Phebe Novakovic : If you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. Hey, one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective, when we talk about a one-to-one book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast. So just keep that in mind. Operator : We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Thank you for the time. Phebe, great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the loss of revenues and profit that slipped into '24 from the G700, which would imply, north of 20% margins for the G700, and given you have quite a few built up already, any color you could give on profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the G650 and the G500 and 600? Phebe Novakovic : Hey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Sure, sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to G650 and the G500 and G600 as it entered service, just because you gave the revenue. Phebe Novakovic : Yeah, the G700 comes in at accretive margins, but as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues and as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out of station work, all impacted. So I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan. Not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that and I'd think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, and then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well, and you have pretty robust demand in Marine and combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. So just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profits? It seems like combat is seeing some of that. Phebe Novakovic : Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group, and it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now. Operator : We'll move next to Seth Seifman at JP Morgan. Seth Seifman : Okay, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off asking about combat and just the 3% growth guide. I guess even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the earlier, what we saw in the second half of '23 would lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double digit, and then being at 3% would imply something like flat or down in the second half. Am I not thinking about that cadence properly, or is there some reason for the growth to really step off or come down in the second half? Phebe Novakovic : No, I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier, and so this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid to upper single digits over and toward the higher upper single digits over our planned period, but we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on, but the demand is there. Seth Seifman : Sure, sure. Okay, excellent. And then on aerospace, I guess it's probably about two years ago that you gave us a multi-year look at the aerospace business and the expectations there as the demand started to gather. Since that bunch of stuff has happened, I think demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification pushouts. As we think about a multi-year outlook for aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, so we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries and '26 even more deliveries, but at this point given the issues that you mentioned, we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, maybe just following on that, but a little bit bigger picture, I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market because if you go to $12 billion in revenue, that's run rating $3 billion a quarter and based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect, but directionally, the order rate had made it to $3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out. And so you want to get customers airplanes and you want to grow, but I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units and so if you're going to $12 billion and then as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess you'd be burning backlog. So how do you think about managing that multi-year supply versus demand in that market? Phebe Novakovic : Well, look, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So I don't see anything that particularly drives an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We have believed for some time and it is turning out to be the case that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand and we're certainly seeing that and we don't see much of an abatement in that. Noah Poponak : Okay. So it sounds like you potentially expect the quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market? Phebe Novakovic : Well, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be. Operator : We'll move next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Yes, thank you very much, Phebe. Good, good numbers. So Gulfstream, two issues. First, you mentioned the Hamas attack and the impact on the G280. Maybe tell me the status of that and what that means in terms of your ability to get deliveries. And secondly, I think the bigger question is, by my quick math, it looks like your guidance for '24 implies an 18% incremental margin at Gulfstream, which seems low given the good margins you should be getting on the G700. Phebe Novakovic : Okay. Right. So look, let's agree that we shouldn't in any given moment infer something from an implied margin. I think as you know probably better than most that the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple, multiple times and I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go, we think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan and I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it. With respect to the G280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management and as I say, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year. Cai von Rumohr : So is that, I still don't quite understand, the 18% margin, is that sort of a P&L drag, the fact that there's -- they can't get enough or the timing? Phebe Novakovic : I wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. '24 is a pivotal year. We saw a significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year that frankly allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 aircraft and 25 aircraft and we delivered 39 aircraft in the fourth quarter. That makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production, but we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well, but this is one step at a time and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go. Operator : We'll move next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : Just following up a bit on Cai's question, the incremental margin was like 38% here in this fourth quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So, what changes to really knock that down to the point that Cai's comment? Phebe Novakovic : Hey, you guys are reverse engineering incremental margin and it's almost impossible to deal with in the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been a good since we acquired them at GD years ago. They have been strong operating performers, with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change, but the mix of business, the level of any given quarters, timing around supply chain and its impact on out-of-station work and mix of service, jet aviation, all of those things are contributing. So, there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know, and they are temporary and we will work through the supply chain issues, but there's nothing systemic that should concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings and revenue over time here. George Shapiro : And one for you, Jason. The unbilled receivables were down like $450 million in the quarter. Is that just Ajax catching up? Jason Aiken : It's a little bit Ajax and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program of combat systems. Those are the two big pieces. Yes, George. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn at Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Phoebe, Phebe the marine guide implies about $340 million in sales growth and in the past, you've talked about Columbia driving $400 million to $500 million of growth per year. So, could an economic price adjustment for Virginia-class be a meaningful source of sales and operating income for Marine in 2024? Phebe Novakovic : Well, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about Marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $300 million to $500 million in any given year, but in the next two years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than one might want, but it is there. So with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Columbia prioritization, as had the Navy, on Virginia and that's just a work in progress as we work through all the particulars with the Navy, but we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside. Robert Spingarn : So just to be clear, there's nothing in there for an adjustment yet? Phebe Novakovic : No. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with your customers. Robert Spingarn : Fair enough. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : And Audra, I think we have time for just one more question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take that question from Peter Arment at Baird. Peter Arment : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Hey, Phebe, maybe just to add and just speak on Marine, you've given us a lot of details on what some of the pressures were, but we've seen throughout the industry, the Defense Production Act has been used to kind of improve some capacity at rocket motors and munitions. Is there an opportunity? I know the Navy's a really good partner and customer. Is there an opportunity for to get some relief and free up some additional resources for you at the yards? Phebe Novakovic : So we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy and for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Columbia and Block 5. So I think from our perspective where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the out of the supply chain. So I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there'll be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain. Peter Arment : Appreciate the color. Thanks, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Hey, and listen, before we leave, I just wanted, this is for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call, and I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years. Nicole Shelton : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the fourth quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nicole Shelton : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.88 per diluted share on revenue of $10.7 billion, operating earnings of $1.036 billion and net earnings of $799 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year ago quarter. Revenue is up 8.6% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up 10.4%. Net earnings are up 9.5%. As a result, earnings per diluted share up $0.24, or 9.1% more than the year ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. Overall, these numbers represent a very strong quarter and a good start to 2024. However, we fell below our own expectations for the quarter and below analyst consensus, which is predicated at least in part on our forecast. The rather obvious explanation is that we forecast 15 to 17 G700 deliveries in the quarter, which did not happen. We received FAA certification for the G700 at the very end of the quarter, too late to make any G700 deliveries. This obviously impacted revenue and earnings in the Aerospace group in the quarter. The good news is that we now have certification, and the delay in deliveries does not change our outlook for the year. Gulfstream still plans to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. So our Aerospace forecast for the year remains unchanged. I'll give you a little more color on this later in my remarks. Another good news, as you can see, was strong performance across the defense portfolio. In short, we performed very well in the quarter over those things within our control. At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide details on our order activity, solid backlog and cash activity before I come back with segment observations. Kimberly Kuryea : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group with a book-to-bill of 1.6:1 and in the Aerospace and Technologies segment, which each had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $93.7 billion, up slightly from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at approximately $134 billion, up 1.5% from year-end. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We had an expected slow start to the year, absent the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700 and continued G700 inventory build. So let's start with Technologies. We continue to see strong cash performance from that group in the quarter. As anticipated, Combat Systems and Marine Systems both built working capital in the quarter based on their unique mix of contract timing versus expected payments. Finally, moving to Aerospace. The lack of G700 deliveries drove us to use cash in the quarter. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $437 million. Since all of what I described is timing related, we still have an expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate around 100%. We expect most of the negative free cash flow to reverse in the second quarter, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the third and fourth quarters. Now to discuss our capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $159 million, or 1.5% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending between 2% and 2.5% of revenue on CapEx this year. Over 50% of that expected spend will be for infrastructure at our 3 shipyards as we continue to invest to support the Navy submarine and shipbuilding plan. Also in the quarter, we paid $361 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 390,000 shares of stock for $105 million at just under $269 per share. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1 billion and a net debt position of $8.2 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million compared with $91 million for the same quarter last year. The reduction in interest expense was attributed to our lower debt balances. Finally, turning to income taxes. We had a 17.5% effective tax rate in the quarter, right in line with our full year guidance, which reflects higher taxes on foreign earnings. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did very well in the absence of the G700 delivery. It had revenue of $2.1 billion and operating earnings of $255 million with a 12.2% operating margin. Revenue is $192 million more than last year's first quarter, a 10.1% increase. To give you a little detail here, the increase was driven by an increase in new aircraft deliveries and an increase in services at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation, partially offset by significantly lower special mission aircraft activity, which is always lumpy. The 24 deliveries in the quarter are fewer than planned but 3 more than the year ago quarter. The mix in the quarter favored large cabin and the 650 in particular, which helped both revenue and earnings. Operating earnings of $255 million are up $26 million over last year's first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Earnings on both new aircraft and aircraft services enjoyed good increases, offset in part by lower earnings on special mission, higher G&A and net R&D. While Gulfstream will continue to experience part shortages that cause significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient, the supply chain is clearly improving and much more predictable. As is now apparent, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in 2024, the first 20 to be delivered or fully built, and deliveries have begun. By the end of this month, the next 7 to 8 will be ready. We plan to deliver these 50 to 52 planes over the quarters in relatively even numbers, with improving margins quarter-over-quarter as we go along. The first one, what we call the lot 1, carries some cost and retrofit burden that will not affect subsequent aircraft deliveries. So expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter with significant improvement in Q3 and Q4. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.2:1 in dollar terms. Sales activity and customer interest is evident this quarter, but concerns over persistent inflation and monetary policy in the U.S., together with concerns about conflict in the Middle East, has slowed the consummation of transactions to some degree. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the demand we see is fleet replenishment for corporations. These multi-aircraft deals usually proceed at a slower pace. The G800 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of G800 for 9 months after the G700 certification, although I'm increasingly reluctant to give estimates about these things that are ultimately out of our control. In short, the Aerospace team had a good quarter. G700 FAA certification is in the rearview mirror, and we hope EASA certification is hard on its heels. And we expect nicely improving margins, particularly in the second half. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $2.1 billion, up almost 20% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $282 million are up 15.1%. Margins at 13.4% are down 60 basis points over the year ago quarter. It is interesting to observe that this very strong increase in revenue is in comparison to last year's first quarter, which enjoyed a 5% increase over '22. We saw increased revenue performance in each of the 3 businesses. The increase came from higher volume on new international tank programs, higher artillery program volume and higher volume on PIRANHA's programs and bridges. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter drove total backlog to $15.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from this time in the year ago quarter. Demand for Combat Systems and products continues to increase, particularly in Europe and in some lines of business in the U.S. Orders for wheeled and tracked combat vehicles are up significantly, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, demand for Abrams also continues. We've seen tank orders from new users, and a number of countries will be introducing Abrams into their combat fleets for the first time. Since Q1 last year, we have received almost $1 billion in orders from both U.S. allies through FMS and the U.S. Army. In the U.S., we are rapidly increasing ammunition production with the opening of our Texas facility, which will increase current 155-millimeter ammo capacity by 83%. As the year goes on, we will continue to work with our Army customer to further increase ammo capacity to meet their requirements. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you last year at this time with respect to growth in this decade. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 of 2019; Q1 '21 was up 10.6% over Q1 '20; Q1 '22 was up 6.8% over Q1 '21; and Q1 '23 was up 12.9% over Q1 '22. Finally, this quarter at $3.3 billion is up 11.3% over Q1 '23. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. However, growth ramps of this character bring with them supply chain and operation issues that are challenging. This particular quarter's growth was almost exclusively Columbia-class construction. Operating earnings are $232 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin is basically the same as last year's quarter. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As we have talked about in previous calls, the story at the marine group is efficiently managing the growth propelled by the U.S. Navy's need for ships, particularly submarines. As a labor-intensive heavy manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industrial base was hit hard by the demographic impacts of COVID. This, coupled with a number of sole-source suppliers of highly complex components, has made it difficult for the industrial base to keep pace with increasing demand. The significant financial investments we have made in our shipyards over the last 12 years, particularly at Electric Boat, has mitigated the impact on us, but we are still hit by schedule and quality problems in the supply chain. Our job is to minimize the efficiency and schedule impacts of late material by increasing our throughput. And we are doing that each and every quarter. In Q1 alone, our productivity increased 11%, but there is more to do. Finally, the Navy's investment in the supply chain has helped and will continue to help as we move forward. For Technologies, we're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion is down less than 1% from the prior year but up 2% over the fourth quarter of last year, and modestly ahead of our expectation to the start of the year. Operating earnings of $295 million are consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%. As we have previously discussed, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volumes. The group received $4 billion in orders during the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1. Both businesses experienced strong order activity, in GDIT's case, the highest book-to-bill since mid-2019. This led to a total backlog of $13.5 billion, an increase of over 5% from a year ago and total estimated contract value of $42.7 billion. The story in Technologies is one of steady growth, particularly at GDIT and increasingly at Mission Systems as they transition from legacy programs to new programs and faster-growth lines of business. Both businesses have robust pipelines driven by their respective investments in different technologies. The group's continued focus on margin performance will result in sequential margin expansion throughout the year as they continue to build their backlog and grow. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I have already said about Aerospace, I will stick to that custom. We do, however, confirm the guidance we gave you at the end of last quarter, and we'll update it at midpoint of the year, as we typically do. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was, in many respects, a rewarding quarter. Let me now turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. Nicole Shelton : Thank you, Phebe. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Scott Deuschle : Kim, can you clarify the G700 delivery expectation for the second quarter? Is it the 20 that are ready to go plus the 7 to 8 that will be ready at the end of this month? Phebe Novakovic : So let me kind of tackle that. I alluded to it in my opening statement. But we're -- we have 50 to 52 airplanes that are going to deliver in about equal amounts of the 700 in the second through the fourth quarters. So think about it that way. So I think that will help you. Scott Deuschle : Okay. And then, Phebe, I was hoping you could spend a moment maybe talking about the growth that Combat Systems is currently seeing in Europe and perhaps how you expect that to trend over the coming quarters. Phebe Novakovic : So the growth in Europe is clearly driven by the threat environment. We've seen increases in orders for combat, wheeled and tracked vehicles and significant bridge orders. We're also seeing increased orders coming out of various countries in Europe for Abrams through the FMS process. So we see that demand signal continuing until the threat environment, frankly, improves. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Looking to marine. When we think about the expectation for the profit margin for the year and kind of where we started, are there kind of visible milestones that you see through the remainder of the year that bring that number higher? Or kind of is it a change in mix? Or kind of what drives the underlying margin improvement through the year? Phebe Novakovic : So two things. One is the increase in productivity at each of the shipyards, and we see that and we've been seeing that for the last few quarters. And it's also fewer disruptions from the supply chain. So those are the two primary factors. Seth Seifman : Right. Okay, okay. Great. And then just when we think about -- I think you mentioned some of the headwinds to demand at Gulfstream from here in terms of monetary policy, geopolitical issues. Just to kind of affirm the expectation for 160 deliveries this year and the way that the backlog will trend through the year, the expectation is that, that's a very sustainable number with potential for that to grow in the years beyond. Phebe Novakovic : So let me clarify a bit. I don't see concerns about inflation or monetary policy impacting demand. It really is just impacting the time from the initiation of a potential interest to the closure of an order, which is also impacted somewhat by large fleet -- airplane fleet orders from corporate customers. So think about it that way, more of a timing issue with the completion of the deals and not a headwind to overall demand. So I think that's an important nuance. And we're still sticking to our delivery guidance for the year. And I think on a going-forward basis, as we've intimated before, we see that those deliveries increasing over time. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the recently passed or soon to be signed supplemental and what implications that could have for the combat business, but also on the submarine side, what sort of additional funding could come from the U.S. Navy? Phebe Novakovic : So let me take them in the inverse order. On the submarine side, the preponderance of the funding in the supplemental is to help stabilize the industrial base, ensuring that we continue to drive order activity on a consistent and repeatable basis. So that is really on the submarine side. In combat, I think you can see there's a fair amount of ammo funding, and we had fully anticipated that. Robert Stallard : Okay. And then just secondly, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the AJAX program in the U.K. Phebe Novakovic : So it is proceeding extremely well through test, continue to work with that customer, but they are very pleased with the performance of the vehicle. Operator : And we will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask one about Aerospace, and I'm sorry for putting you on the spot with the mental math. But last year -- or last quarter, you talked about the G700 profit contribution being around 25%. So when we think about the Q1 performance, it was actually really good relative to our number of 12.1% margin. It would imply you see a deceleration in the underlying business for Aerospace just given G700 comes in at 50 units. So I guess, how do we think about the mix movement throughout the year for Aerospace? Phebe Novakovic : Well, let's talk about the first predicate in that question. I don't believe we've ever disclosed any margin on a particular airplane, and we haven't there. I think we can't -- it can't take and discern revenue and earnings in any given quarter as attributable to one airplane. So I think you need to think about it holistically.  But we see the -- we don't see any real changes in the mix throughout the year. And we'll do a detailed bottom-up review in Q2. But for right now, we're sticking with both our mix, our earnings, our margin and revenue expectations. So we're off to a pretty good start, I'd say. And we're very encouraged at how the outlook looks for the rest of the year. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: Can we assume that G700 is accretive to the 15% full year guidance? Phebe Novakovic : So think about it this way. This is ultimately going to be a very profitable program. But as I explained in my remarks, the first lot of 20 or so carries with it additional cost. We'll see those in -- largely in Q2. So think about Q2 as an increase in revenue of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion and in earnings of about $100 million to $110 million, and then progress nicely thereafter. And again, that's all impacted by the multiplicity of factors in our Aerospace business that drive margins. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Phebe, so Rob's question on the supplemental and the submarine industrial base money, so there's money there. There's a lot of money in the base budget, it appears. You're spending additional CapEx today that you'll eventually recover through working capital, profit. How does -- I mean, it's a lot of money. I mean how does that manifest itself in your numbers as we think about over the next couple of years? Phebe Novakovic : So for the supply chain support, it has minimal impact on us. It's, however, extremely important because the stabilization of the supply chain is critical to the resumption of full cadence on Virginia and the increased cadence on Columbia.  So funding is also robust for submarines. We've got one we projected in '25. And then it would be extremely helpful to get a full ship set of Virginias also appropriated because that, again, helps stabilize the industrial base with repeatable revenue that they can plan around. David Strauss : Okay. Last quarter, you made some more kind of positive comments regarding the potential for share repurchase to step up. Obviously, you did a little bit this quarter, but not that much. How are you thinking about that now? Did that have to do with the fact that you ended up burning cash in Q1? Just how you're thinking about share repo and the balance sheet from here. Phebe Novakovic : So the way we think about share repurchases, and this will be true going forward, is really in the regular order. Recall what we were facing in Q1. And that was we're looking down the throat of a potential, and at some point looked very likely, government shutdown. And so I think that prudence and conservatism in the face of that kind of uncertainty is really key. But the cash performance for the remainder of the year is going to be very strong, and we will act accordingly. Operator : And we will take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Phebe, what's the framework for the pace of G700 deliveries beyond this year compared to this year? Not asking for quarterly numbers or anything like that, but just given this year's had some abnormalities compared to a recurring airplane. And then, Kim, just what's the updated view on free cash flow to net income conversion for the year? Phebe Novakovic : Well, so let me talk about 700. We never, except I think, on 1 or 2 occasions about 5, 6 years ago, give the future year expectations. But 700 is a very, very successful program, and it will continue to execute well.  I'll turn it over to Kim on cash. Kimberly Kuryea : On cash. Thank you, Phebe. So with respect to cash and the expectation, we still anticipate achieving about 100% of free cash flow conversion in 2024. We had expected the first quarter to be negative even before considering the fact that we didn't deliver any G700. So we had planned for a negative free cash flow in the first quarter, and that was mostly driven by some contract timing in the Combat Systems segment and some in the Marine Systems segment. But we expect that most of that negative cash will reverse in the second quarter with a stronger third quarter and then a steeper ramp in the fourth quarter. Operator : We will take our next question from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Phebe, could you comment on -- or Kim, could you comment on the margin expansion implied at Combat Systems as you move through the rest of the year? I think it has to be 80 to 100 basis points on average up year-on-year for the rest of the year. And maybe the underlying dynamics of given the volume, why we didn't see more of a drop-through margin in the first quarter? Phebe Novakovic : So what drove margin in the first quarter were two things : mix as we came off of older legacy programs, particularly in the vehicle world and in the U.S. and then -- and began ramping up newer programs, vehicle programs in the U.S.; and then a significant amount of the revenue growth came from facilities investment which, by definition, carries a lower margin than production. So both of those things will reverse throughout the course of the year, and combat margins will increase. Our expectation is quarter-over-quarter. Remember, this is a high operating leverage group. So they ought to do quite well here. Myles Walton : Okay. And one clarification on Gulfstream's backlog, if I could. I think that there were some adjustment downward in the backlog. Were those cancellations or ForEx, maybe 6 large jet cancellations or thereabouts? Phebe Novakovic : I don't think that's the way to look at it. But why don't Nicole get back to you on that? But we didn't have any particular notable cancellations. So let us unpack that one with you a little later. Operator : We will take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : So Phebe, with the increased demand on munitions and so on and so forth, I mean, what are you doing to mitigate any of the issues that could arise from growth in those markets, just like we've seen in the Navy markets given all the demand and growth? There's been supply chain issues. Are you expecting... Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So in the combat world, it's a little bit more of a robust supply chain in general that we typically have not had difficulty with, typically. We know our priority. The suppliers who could conceivably cause issues, and we've been working with them to ensure that they can manage this growth. But we're pretty comfortable that we can execute the growth. Our focus is really on operations and execution. And those will be the  two key drivers of the profitability in that group. Ronald Epstein : Got it. Got it. And then maybe back to the kind of the naval side of the house and the supply chain. Could you give us any color on where there are actual weaknesses in the supply chain where investment has to be made? Phebe Novakovic : So I'd say in the large -- in the single-source, sole-source suppliers who are, by definition, critical. And the Navy has focused quite intensely on those particular products and supply chain items. And I think they've been pretty explicit about where some of that might be. And I think it's best to think about it that way. But we do believe that working with the Navy customer, the continued infusion into that supply chain will help stabilize. But they are the pacing item now for Electric Boat. Operator : And we will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : On marine, the Navy recently described some shipbuilding delays really across programs. And the one that really stood out was Columbia-class delays reported on the turbines and the bow. Can you give us a sense of changes you've seen in schedule that affect you kind of across the program base and particularly on Columbia? Phebe Novakovic : So I think you've articulated what the Navy has said. I will tell you, our throughput and productivity has been strong on Columbia. It enjoys the highest national security priority. So we have done pretty well on Columbia and are increasing our throughput on Columbia. So then it's really those pacing items that are out there. And we're working with our Navy customer to see if there are additional things we can do to recover some schedule and if there are any workarounds. But this is going to be a bit of a slog for the supply chain. Douglas Harned : And then also on shipbuilding, inflation has affected shipbuilding costs a lot over the last few years. We've seen pricing on new awards go up. And when you look forward in the budget, is there a concern that you're basically, if you're going to -- if the Navy's budget is really going to be able to afford the kinds of inflation increases that may come along with the continued ramp in shipbuilding? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So I think you've known over the years, I tend not to comment on individual service budgeting. But inflation certainly has been a factor. And to the extent that we can increase throughput to offset some of that, we will. But the Navy is well aware of the inflation impact and I think is working hard with the whole shipbuilding industrial base to adjust some of that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Phebe, following up on the marine question. In addition to the delay in the Columbia class, the DoD did request one less Virginia class for the fiscal year '25 budget request. So I mean, if we take all this into perspective, can you provide some context on what this means for marine revenue growth over the next few years? And does the margin with a 7 handle on it, is that more the new norm for this business? Phebe Novakovic : So let me address that in the inverse order. Margins will be improving at our shipyards. We have every expectation all of our shipyards, NASSCO, Bath and Electric Boat. One of the things, as we've talked frequently about, is the margin impact of quality and schedule problems coming out of the supply chain. And as the supply chain stabilizes, that will help as well. And what was your first part of your question? Kristine Liwag : The revenue cadence, including the just one Virginia class for fiscal year '25. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Okay. So it has no impact in the short term for Electric Boat because we've got plenty of work in front of us. It could have an impact in the outer years outside of our planning horizon. But critical here is, in fact, the additional ship set of funding. We have long lead material on Virginia. That is very important to the supply chain. And to the extent that we can ensure that we get a full second Virginia ship set so that we're buying it to a year, I think, is very important for the overall health of the industrial -- submarine and industrial base. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. Kenneth Herbert : If we look, Phebe, at your comments around timing in Gulfstream, is it still fair to assume that you should be looking at a book-to-bill at 1 or greater for Gulfstream in '24? Phebe Novakovic : So it's a good planning assumption. It is how we are thinking about our internal planning. But let's see how we do as we start to significantly ramp up production and deliveries. So -- but as I said, that's a good planning assumption. Kenneth Herbert : Okay. Great. And just a clarification for Kim. The comments sound like the free cash flow ramp really sort of accelerates in the second half of the year. But with all the 700 deliveries expected this quarter, free cash flow should be positive in the second quarter, correct? Kimberly Kuryea : Yes. That's pretty much what you should assume. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, you said recently that with the -- even though the aerospace supply chain is improving, your ramp this year could challenge that improvement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Phebe Novakovic : So we still have -- look, it's definitely improving. Quality is improving and schedule reliability is improving. But make no mistake, we still have a lot of out-of-station work. And that impacts the profitability and margin on airplanes that are experiencing that. So we definitely see improvement. We are optimistic that they can keep pace, but it's not without its margin challenges. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then also, I think you commented you had good bookings in Aerospace in the quarter, reflecting strong demand. But I think you've said the U.S. has been very strong. How is aircraft demand elsewhere in the world? Phebe Novakovic : So there's no real change, I think, from the previous quarters, U.S. corporations, private and public, high-net-worth individuals, both U.S. and outside the U.S. So no real changes, no real surprises. Sort of the typical customer base that we see is I think the way you should think about it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Phebe, the Army wants to reach 100,000 155 shells by, I think, October 2025. Can you update us on how your ramp is going? You've discussed that, that supply chain is a little more robust. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So our ramp there is more about increasing the facilities that we have. And as I noted in my remarks, the opening of our Texas facility, which we worked very, very hard to expedite and frankly did it in almost record time, was very important because it increased the throughput and the productivity of the number of shells by 83%. So we're on track with the Army to get where we need to be, and our objective is to move even faster. And so far, we have been. But the Army has been a critical and extremely important partner here in what is really a national security imperative. Peter Arment : Yes. And then just if you could make any comments on the G280 program just given the conflict that's going on in the Middle East. Phebe Novakovic : So we had anticipated the impacts on the 280 in our guidance too, but I will tell you that they are doing quite well and are slightly ahead of our schedule. We're still sticking to our deliveries, but I think it's notable that they're managing pretty well in this tough environment. Operator : We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Cai Von Rumohr : Good quarter. Phebe Novakovic : Thanks, Cai. Cai Von Rumohr : So could you update us on the status of the G400? How is it doing? And is it fair to assume that it might have a gap of approximately 12 months between its certification and that of the G800? Phebe Novakovic : I think I said last quarter, I'm done predicting process over which we have little control. We've tried in the past to give you indicators of our internal -- or actually, our internal -- our dates. So I'm kind of out of the detailed predicting mode. I will say the program is doing extremely well. And it's -- it will fly in the third quarter, and I think we'll be flying a pretty mature airplane. Cai Von Rumohr : Excellent. And then your R&D was up a fair amount in the first quarter. Could you give us some color of the pattern of the R&D at Gulfstream this year and looking forward? How should we think about that? Phebe Novakovic : Well, pretty much steady as she goes, particularly this year. We've got a number of, as you know, programs in the certification process. And so I'd see that at least through this year is pretty consistent. No real surprise this year, steady as she goes. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Jason Gursky : Phebe, I wanted to just quickly go back to your comments on Aerospace and what, I guess, you described as an elongation of your sales cycle. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the overall size of the pipeline and how that is evolving. I understand things are taking longer to close, but I'd also be kind of curious to know whether there are an increasing number of people that are interested. Phebe Novakovic : So the pipeline remains robust. And I look to that as encouraging, a good sign. It's been that way for a while. People want our airplanes, and that's driving demand. Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. So good metrics going on there, it sounds like. Then just really quickly on -- maybe this is a question targeted at Technologies. But I'd love to get some updated thoughts from you on artificial intelligence, AI, the adoption that you're seeing with your customers. How you see this kind of playing out and affecting your business. And then maybe, as I suggest, focused on Technologies. Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So we have been investing in AI to support our customers, and particularly at GDIT and somewhat at Mission Systems. And I would say that there, we're working closely with our customers. They define what the art of the possible is for them in AI. And as you all know, there are some government -- governance challenges around that. But the more sophisticated we get and our ability  to tailor AI solutions, I think the more comfortable our customer becomes and will ultimately drive some increased revenue.  I haven't seen too much of that yet because I think the government is not like -- unlike other industries where its adoption is. People are careful, and I think properly so. And I would argue that would be true across the entirety of our business. Operator : Our final question today comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. Gavin Parsons : Phebe, you highlighted the stronger second half Aerospace margins that's a more normal volume and G700 production. Is that more of an appropriate starting point for 2025 than the full year 15%? Phebe Novakovic : Nice try. So look, yes, I think once you get through the first lot, our performance from a margin standpoint will continue to improve. And you'll see that, third quarter will be significantly better than second quarter, and fourth quarter will be even better still. But we will update you on our regular order. We kind of keep our discipline, as you well know, around updating guidance, and I think that, that's appropriate. Gavin Parsons : Yes. I appreciate that detail. And then just in terms of the 100% cash conversion for the year, what's the opportunity to exceed that given last year, you were well above and you built a lot of G700 inventory? Kimberly Kuryea : I think right now, we're just focused. Given the steep ramp in the second half of the year, we're really focusing on trying to hit that mark at this point in time. Phebe Novakovic : And we should get there. Nicole Shelton : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.

On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $11.98 billion, operating earnings of $1.16 billion and net income of $905 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased a strong 18%, with a 51% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 10% increase across our defense units, strong growth by any standard. Importantly, operating earnings of $1.16 billion are up almost $200 million or 20.2%, demonstrating solid operating leverage. Similarly, net earnings are up 21.6% and earnings per share up 21% over the year ago quarter. You will note, we missed Street EPS consensus by $0.02 due entirely to the slip of 4 G700 deliveries from the last week in the quarter to the beginning Q3. One has since been delivered, three are imminent. From a different perspective, the sequential comparisons are also quite favorable. Revenue was up $1.2 billion and operating earnings are up $120 million on steady margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $22.7 billion is up $2.67 billion or 13.3% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of nearly $2.2 billion are up 15.4%. Net earnings of $1.7 billion are up 15.6% despite a higher provision for income taxes. In a few minutes, our CFO, Kim Kuryea, will provide you with free cash flow for the first half and remainder of the year, our strong continued order activity and backlog, as well as some additional relevant financial information. But first, I will take you through each of the segments. We'll start with Aerospace. Let me give you some comparative numbers that will show the front end of a tremendous growth surge for Aerospace that will progress favorably throughout the year. Then I will attempt to put all of this in some reasonable perspective for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.94 billion and operating earnings of $319 million with a 10.9% operating margin. Revenue is $987 million more than last year's second quarter, a remarkable 51% increase. The revenue increase was driven by additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher service revenue. We delivered 37 aircraft, including 11 newly certified G700s in the quarter. This is four fewer than we expected to deliver, but more about that in a minute. Operating earnings of $319 million are up $83 million, 35% over the year ago quarter. The 10.9% operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by G700 deliveries that carried more than expected costs from three things : First, retrofit; second, out-of-station work related to the late arrival of parts; and three, the extended certification period. This cost burden will affect 20 lot one aircraft, which includes five test aircraft that will not deliver this year. So we are through the lot one cost burden for this year within the next four deliveries. The good news is that margins on the G700 are expected to increase by 600 to 700 basis points in lot two and by a similar increment in lot three. By the time we reach lot three production and deliveries, we will have reached a steady state in terms of productivity and predictability. A few comments on predictability. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. But we planned 15 for Q2 and deliver 11. So much for predictability. We actually had the remaining four completed and ready to go, but could not get through the preflight delivery testing in time. You might be surprised to learn that each G700 has flown about 30 hours of tests before delivery. Two of the planes also needed a supplemental type certificate because of a very different cabin configuration. That wasn't done by the end of the quarter. All right, back to some numerical comparisons. The sequential numbers are equally impressive. Revenue is up $856 million, a strong 41% increase, and operating earnings are up $64 million, about 25%, affected by 130 basis point degradation in operating margins for the reason I just mentioned a moment ago. You will see much stronger operating margins in the third quarter, followed by even better operating margin and related earnings in the fourth quarter. Separately, we still expect to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. Look for about 16 in the third quarter and 23 to 25 in the fourth quarter. From an orders perspective, we had a respectable quarter at 0.9:1 book-to-bill in dollar terms. There is strong interest in a fair pipeline across the product mix. As I noted last quarter, bringing transactions to close has elongated somewhat, as there is some caution, while customers digest the impact of geopolitical events in general and U.S. presidential election in particular. The United States remains our strongest market, but the yield is improving. The Middle East shows very strong potential. And just very recently, we have seen some improvement in China. The interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at the end of the year suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have both G700 FAA and EASA certifications behind us. The Aerospace comparative revenue and earnings numbers in the quarter are very good by any reasonable standard, but still behind consensus, largely attributable to deliveries that did not make it to the wire. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter. It is handling the rapid increase in deliveries and revenue on a methodical and disciplined fashion. We look forward to a powerful second half with increasing revenue and earnings quarter-over-quarter as we forecasted at the end of last quarter. Moving to the defense business as a collective. We once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of almost $2.3 billion, up 19% over the year ago quarter, with growth at each of the three business units. Earnings of $313 million are up almost 25%, and margins at 13.7% represent a 70 basis point increase over the Q2 last year. In short, very strong operating performance from Combat Systems. The increased revenue came from facilities expansion and artillery work in our ammo business, coupled with increases in international tank and wheeled vehicle sales and U.S. Army programs of record. Each of the businesses increased earnings nicely, with particularly strong operating leverage in our international vehicle business. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8.8% and earnings rose 11%. Year-to-date, revenue of about $4.4 billion is up 19.3% and earnings of $595 million are up almost $100 million, or 20%. Combat saw robust order intake with over $3.4 billion awarded in Q2, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio, ranging from ammunition to main battle tanks for the U.S. Army and wheeled vehicles for an international customers. Demand remained steady, particularly for the Abrams main battle tank and international wheeled vehicles. We expect demand for ammo to continue to rise for some time to come as we rapidly increase production of our artillery shells and components. All in all, a very strong growth and performance quarter for Combat Systems. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.45 billion is up $394 million, almost 13% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, while Virginia-class and DDG-51 revenue also increased nicely. Operating earnings are $245 million, up $10 million over the year ago quarter with a 60 basis points decrease in operating margin. Margins were impacted by continued delays to EB from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improvement in DDG-51 performance of Bath and continued steady performance at NASSCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 3.7% and earnings improved 5.6% in Q2, driven by volume at EB, as we saw some quarter-over-quarter improvement in supply chain deliveries to the yard and continued positive performance at NASSCO. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $6.8 billion is up 12.1% and earnings of $477 million are up 7%. As I noted a moment ago, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be impacted by late deliveries from the supply chain, which both delay schedule and impacts costs. At a sequence work on multi-ton modules is time-consuming and expensive. Our strategy, as you know, has been to increase our productivity to somewhat offset that impact. To that end, throughput, a significant measure of productivity, continues to improve, hiring is good and attrition is lower, so all good signs. In summary, we are starting to see some momentum build in our shipyards to meet the delivery and repair requirements of our customer, the U.S. Navy. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow, but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. Finally, Technologies. The group had another good quarter with revenue of nearly $3.3 billion, up 2.5% over the year ago quarter and operating earnings of $320 million, up 13.1% on a 90 basis point improvement in margin. This nice improvement in operating performance was across both businesses. GDIT margins increased 40 basis points, emission systems margins were up 130 basis points as they continue to recover from supply chain impacts experienced in 2023 and before. Sequentially, revenue was up $81 million or 2.5% and operating earnings are up 8.5% on a 50 basis points improvement in margin. And the story is much the same for the year-to-date with revenue of $6.5 billion, up about 1%, and operating earnings of $615 million, up 5.7% against the first six months of last year. As a result, margins for the group were up 40 basis points year-to-date to 9.4%. So all relevant comparisons this quarter show revenue and earnings growth and a margin expansion of both businesses, positioning them well going forward. In short, GDIT is holding its industry-leading margins, while consistently delivering year-over-year growth, while Mission Systems is delivering nice margin expansion as it transitions from sunsetting legacy programs. The group received $3.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing the total of $7.2 billion for the first six months. That results in a book-to-bill for the group of 1.0 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year-to-date. Total awards for the group in the first half were up 30% compared with the first six months of 2023. This is on the strength of win rates consistently around 80% for the group and capture rates at roughly 65%, both very strong for this industry. Backlog was down slightly from the end of the first quarter due to the removal of backlog associated with an international divestiture in the quarter, but was up almost $200 million from a year ago. As importantly, the qualified pipeline remains very robust at over $120 billion. So the group is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Let me now turn the call over to Kim. A - Kimberly Kuryea : Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective at $10 billion, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.8:1 for the company. This was achieved in the quarter when revenue grew 18% over last year, and there were no significant shipbuilding contracts awarded. Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 0.9:1, while revenue grew over 40% sequentially with the initial deliveries of the G700. On the defense side of the business, Combat Systems did particularly well with a book-to-bill of 1.5:1, and Technologies was 1 :1. We ended the quarter with backlog of $91.3 billion, essentially even with where we were a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at nearly $130 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $814 million of operating cash flow. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $613 million for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 68%. Technologies led the segments with strong cash flow generation in the quarter. When you consider the free cash flow through the first half of 2024, we are slightly positive at $176 million and about $250 million ahead of what we had planned. After the planned slow start in the first half, we expect significant second half growth. With the majority of the cash generated in the fourth quarter, we are still planning a cash conversion rate around 100% for the year. So you may be wondering what's driving cash to be so backloaded this year. It's apparent from our balance sheet that we have been building up working capital in the first half of the year, which we expect to substantially unwind in the second half. One obvious driver of this is Gulfstream with the ramp-up for the certification and deliveries of the G700. The planned G700 deliveries in the second half are significant, which will reduce working capital. Another large contributor to the growth in working capital has been Combat Systems. They have several programs that pay at delivery. Thus, we are buying material in the first half of the year that results in product deliveries and cash in the second half of the year. Combat is also subject to the timing of deposits on international programs, and the first half of the year has been a period of liquidating deposits received in prior periods. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $201 million or 1.7% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year and slightly above 2% of sales when the year wraps up. Also in the quarter, we paid $389 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 119,000 shares of stock for $34 million. Through the first half, we repurchased only a modest number of shares for a total of $139 million, driven largely by our 2024 cash profile. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion and a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down over $300 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million compared to $89 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $166 million, down from $180 million for the same period in 2023 on lower debt balances. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $320 million. Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.2%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full-year, which remains around 17.5%. For the second half of the year, we expect the rate to be lower in the third quarter and then a bit higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you. Phebe Novakovic : All right. Thanks, Kim. Let me move on to give you updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we are sticking with our same earnings estimate, but we'll get there with higher revenue and about a 100 basis point drop in margins for all the reasons I mentioned to you a few minutes ago. We are still holding to our delivery estimate of about 160 airplanes. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat will have revenue of about $200 million higher than previously projected as a result of continued demand. So look for total revenue of about $8.7 billion. Margin should be about the same. All in, operating earnings will be up $30 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $1 billion of Electric Boat and somewhat at Bath. So we will have annual revenue between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.4%, with operating earnings up around $45 million over the January forecast. For Technologies, we are not changing our earlier guidance to you. On a company wide basis, we see annual revenue up about $2 billion, with overall margins down about 30 basis points. So total revenue of $47.8 billion to $48.2 billion, and operating earnings up modestly. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of $14.40 to $14.50, $0.05 over prior guidance. I will note that normally, this time of year, we have solid insight into revenue and margin. In this growth environment, the upside has been difficult to predict with equal clarity. Should anything materially change in Q3, I will give you another credit guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Nicole Shelton : Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from David Strauss at Barclays. David Strauss : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, on the G700, as I understand, there are some issues that you have to fix with these prebuilt airplanes. Can you just talk about what exactly the issue is, how far of the way you are through that? And whether this is still an issue in terms of airplanes that are on the line? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So very late in the certification process, we had a requirement to bind together some wires in the tail of the airplane. So relatively simple fix. For those airplanes that we had already built, we took the tails off. For those that we were building, we just didn't put them on. So this is largely behind us. And contributed to a bit to the cost impact on lot one. But I would note that it's extremely hard to discern anything meaningful looking from the outside in here. This is, as I said, largely behind us and was pretty late in the process. And not particularly difficult to do. David Strauss : Great. And so none of the slips relate to kind of supply chain issues? It was more about just fixing the certification issue? Phebe Novakovic : Right. Think about the supply chain as more a question of cost than delivery. David Strauss : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird. Peter Arment : Thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Peter Arment : Yes, it's really encouraging to hear about the 50 to 52 is still intact for the G700. Maybe you could just touch upon, I think expectations around bookings? I know you've talked about in the past about geopolitics and a lot of just volatility in the world. Just your thoughts on just bookings for the year? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : So we tried to give you some color around that. In the remarks, I'd say that we typically see in any U.S. presidential election, a slowdown around the election. And I think this won't be any different. But we do expect, as I noted in my remarks, a more robust fourth quarter because we've got the expiration of the accelerated depreciation. And the pipeline is quite good. And I gave you also some color around the geographical distribution there. So all in all, there's quite a bit of interest in our airplanes. Peter Arment : That's great to hear. Just as a quick follow-up. Just your latest thoughts on just the G400. Is that still tracking to meet your kind of original plan? Phebe Novakovic : It is, and we ought to fly very soon. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Spingarn at Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Spingarn : Phebe, maybe sort of a two-parter on Marine. I wanted to ask you, first, with the recent supplemental, there was money, a little over $3 billion to help support the submarine industrial base. And you did mention last time that there were a few sole-source suppliers of complex components that were causing some of the delays. So wondering if that money has gotten to them and is resolving the issue or if you had to qualify alternate sources? And then the longer-term question is, a decade ago or maybe a little bit longer, Marine was a 10% type margin business. And given the supply chain issues, the impact to the shipbuilding workforce in the aftermath of COVID, is that a realistic target at some point in the future? And what might be the timing on that? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Sure. So let me take each part of your question in turn. So the Navy, working quite closely with the Congress, allocated significant funding for the industrial base, as you noted. That money has begun to flow, and it is intended for another, and it's targeted for a number of uses. One, increased throughput; two, some facilitization, some training, increased hiring. And so it's been really critical, and we've been pushing very hard to get that money as fast as we possibly can into the supply chain to help stabilize them. And let me put it to you this way. There are some supply chain providers who are improving and improving quite nicely. We still have some challenges out there that are pretty well publicized, but we're continuing to work with the U.S. Navy on how to the extent that those can be mitigated. So we continue to see cost impacts from late deliveries of out-of-sequence work, as I noted in my remarks. But we continue to be hopeful. We are hopeful that the additional funding that we're putting into the supply chain should help stabilize over time. So with respect to your 10% margin, that certainly is our goal. I think the supply chain has to stabilize. We've got to come down our learning curves on Columbia. Virginia throughput has to increase. So we will ultimately stabilize in the Marine group. And I will notice, by the way, I think you mentioned something about the workforce. We have, in the last year or so had no difficulty in hiring at our shipyards, and our training program has been pretty robust. So we've got shipbuilders coming out of that training program with a higher than typical level of proficiency. Our retention is also much better. So that gives us some confidence in the throughput and productivity capacity of the shipyards. But everything in shipbuilding is slow. So it's small, incremental improvement over time. But I think 10% is a reasonable goal over time, and there's no way to estimate that with any precision. Not going to speculate, but it is objective. Robert Spingarn : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much, Phebe. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Cai von Rumohr : Good morning. So the tail issue at Gulfstream, does the required rework extend beyond the first 20 units in the first block? And should we be looking for a sequential build in terms of unit deliveries, so that I would assume then you have less first block impact in the third quarter than the second and even less or none in the fourth. And therefore, you should see a strong lift in the margin sequentially. Is that the way to look at it? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So I tried to give you a lot of color on that in my remarks. But with respect to the binding of some of those wires in the tail, that's largely behind us. And with respect to the margin trajectory, we see nice margin improvement in this quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Think about the fourth quarter as mid- to high-upper teens. Cai von Rumohr : Okay. And because of this rework, should we assume that the profitability on Block 2 for the G700 that the sequential step-up from 1 to 2 will be somewhat bigger than one might normally look for? Phebe Novakovic : I tried to give you that in my remarks, but this is really a Lot 1 issue. Cai von Rumohr : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gursky at Citi. Jason Gursky : Hey, good morning everybody. Phebe, I just wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the services business in Aerospace. And just some of the trends that you're seeing there with the fleet utilization and what you're seeing in the competitive environment in that business as well? Phebe Novakovic : So on the service side, services, as we said before, will grow with the expansion of the fleet. Our objective is to get as much of the Gulfstream worked as possible, and we've got the vast preponderance of that already. Services is growing this year. As is, by the way, special mission, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase this year, but we should see nice steady growth over time in the service sector. And there's no real -- with respect to services, there's no real difference in any of the competitive environment. Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. And then turning to Technologies and maybe using a bit of your crystal ball on the pipeline and the outlook for bookings and book-to-bill there. What's the environment look like there for you all over the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months on the pipeline and the outlook for book-to-bill for the Technologies business? Phebe Novakovic : So we continue to see a very active pipeline. I think the available market at the moment is over $120 billion, it's pretty robust. And we've been winning our fair share and a little bit more than our fair share. So we believe that over time, that will continue as it has in the last couple of years drive services growth and frankly, at Mission Systems as well. So I think technology is positioned for a nice steady slow growth, which is exactly what we have promised in the past and what we're delivering. So pretty steady. Operator : We'll go next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : Yes. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, George. George Shapiro : Phebe, I just wanted some clarification. You had said that the pretty much all the costs were, incorporated yet you delivered 11, five you said won't be delivered until next year, but there's still four left. Is that the four that you just delivered in the first week or so of the second -- of the third quarter? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. So the Lot 1 consisted of about 20 or so airplanes. All five are test airplanes, they'll deliver next year. But this year, the Lot 1 costs are going to be behind us imminently. We've delivered one of the four. And I tried to give you some color on the delivery process. And the other three imminent here. So I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Does that help you? George Shapiro : Yes, that helps. And then just a quick follow-up on the usual question. If I look at the gross bookings versus the net bookings from your backlog, it's like a $171 million difference. Was that just forfeiture cancellation, currency-related? Do you have any comments on that? Phebe Novakovic : Nothing that I can put my finger on, to be quite honest, in the moment. George Shapiro : Okay. And one last one and aftermarket growth in the quarter at Gulfstream? Phebe Novakovic : Pretty good for us. The service business, and we expect it to continue to grow this year, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase, along with special mission. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC. Kenneth Herbert : Yes, hi, Phebe. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Kenneth Herbert : I wanted to see if you could make some comments on Combat. And specifically, the outlook for bookings in Europe and other regions. But also, how should we think about with the orders you're booking today, the impact on the backlog and to what extent are they accretive to segment margins? Or how accretive could they be as some of the more recent bookings flow into the backlog of revenues? Phebe Novakovic : So the bookings continue to reflect the threat environment. Both that they were driven in the quarter, both by international vehicle orders and U.S. ammunition and Army programs of record. And I think we'll see as we're going forward, I'd say that Combat Systems is typically, as we talked about in the past, probably a mid-14% margin business, but it will have quarter variability, sometimes up around 15%. So it's really a question of mix. In the moment, we see increased what we call sustainment, think about repair and support, which tends to carry a little higher margin. And you didn't exactly ask this question, but I'll sort of answer it. As we move from the lower margin facilitization work to the higher-margin throughput on -- that's generated like the throughput on ammunition, you'll see a little bit of margin expansion there. Kenneth Herbert : And just can you quantify the cash impact in the second half and the fourth quarter from the timing of some of the cash receipts on Combat? Phebe Novakovic : I don't think we've broken out cash for you by business group. I think Kim tends to give you a fair amount of color on what was going on in the third and particularly the fourth quarter of unwinding some of the prebuilds in Combat with the deliveries of those vehicles and material. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : Hi, Doug. Douglas Harned : If we look at Gulfstream and kind of look through the current margin issues, and when you get out to 2026, you should be at a point where you've got a full portfolio of maturing aircraft, commonality. And if we go back to the days when you could get to those 18% to 20%-type margins, is there a way to think about the progression here? There are clearly near-term issues. You've got the G800 to 400. How do you see working through those, the implication for margins? And where you would come out when you're what I would say, more of a normalized mode? Phebe Novakovic : I'd say there's good potential for higher margins along the lines that we had seen in the past. But exactly when at this point, it's hard to pinpoint. But I think we're pretty confident and pleased with long-term margin trajectory at Aerospace for all the reasons that I think you quite potently listed. Douglas Harned : And then just changing gears. When you look at munitions, I know you're expanding capacity substantially. A lot of people look at the situation in Europe. We've got an election coming up. And when you look at the demand for munitions, if you run that out five, six, seven years, how do you see that? Because others are -- Rheinmetall and others are also ramping up here. How do you see that extending over time? Phebe Novakovic : Well, it's hard to look into a crystal ball much past a planning period. But we anticipate for the next couple of years, increased munitions orders as dictated by the threat environment. And we're pretty confident in that. So that's kind of how I look at it. It's awfully difficult to predict the threat environment with any kind of clarity other than pure speculation outside the next couple of years. Douglas Harned : I was asking because as you think about this build out. And for what period of time are you looking at is kind of what I was getting at in terms of growth? Phebe Novakovic : Yes, a couple of years. I wasn't clear on that. I apologize. Yes, I'd say a couple of years of this. I'd say three, four years max, somewhere along those lines. And then we'll see. I think there have been some profound lessons learned about the criticality of munitions, ammunition. So I expect those to be incorporated in force is thinking. Douglas Harned : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, Phebe, you increased the sales at Gulfstream, but no change in deliveries. Is that an ASP or a services-driven higher revenue base? Phebe Novakovic : A couple of things, including services, as I had noticed, increase in services and also an increase in special mission which are kind of lumpy, as you know, and we've talked about in the past. Myles Walton : Okay. Got it. And then just another detailed question. Thanks for the color on the unit improvement in margins. Are the unit quantities about 20 aircraft is Lot 1? And then secondarily, when you move to the 800, the G800, should we anticipate a similar profile of profitability? Or do you think you'll be at higher profit sooner on the 800 out of the gates? Thanks. Phebe Novakovic : Planning purposes is the latter. But that's probably all the clarity we've got at the moment. It all depends on the certification process, but we anticipate, I think and reasonably anticipate that they'll come out of the gate very strong. Myles Walton : Okay. And where that lost quantity is about [indiscernible]? Phebe Novakovic : Yes. Myles Walton : Okay, thanks. Phebe Novakovic : It's typical lot quantities. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Scott Deuschle : Phebe, can you characterize the ramp-up of this new munitions facility in Texas you opened up during the quarter? I guess, are you likely to exit 3Q at a relatively full run rate? Or is the ramp more gradual from that? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So we opened up the facility. The first line is running and producing as we anticipated. We are standing up lines 3 and 4. So that's a material increase in the throughput of that facility, but it's a modern facility with a very strong and good workforce. So we're pretty encouraged that we will quickly come down our learning curves and produce at or above our plan. Scott Deuschle : Great. And Kim, just to clarify your earlier comments, are you expecting working capital to be a source of cash in 3Q? Kimberly Kuryea : Yes. But I would say that when you look at the cash profile for the rest of the year, most of that cash does come in the fourth quarter. So most of that working capital will unwind in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter. Scott Deuschle : Okay. So modestly positive in 3Q? Kimberly Kuryea : Yes. Scott Deuschle : Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Phebe, a couple of physical questions for you. First of all, on the U.S., if the Ukraine supplemental were to be 0, what sort of risk could that present to GD in the future? And then second, in the U.K., a change of government over here, whether there's any implications for AJAX down the line? Thank you. Phebe Novakovic : I will take that in the inverse order. Don't anticipate any particular changes in AJAX. The vehicle is performing extremely well. The U.K. Army is pleased with it. So I think that, that's a standard piece of kit for the U.K. Army. With respect to the U.S., I think it's -- the Ukrainian supplemental certainly helped, but was not the only source of funding for munitions. And frankly, the munitions demand is a reality independent of, I think a lot of other things based on the lessons learned that most land forces, I believe have incorporated at this point. So we expect that to continue. Robert Stallard : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Good morning. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Seth Seifman : One quick specific one on Gulfstream. The out-of-station work you talked about due to late supplier deliveries, is that behind us now as well? Phebe Novakovic : The supply chain has improved, but it is not completely healed yet. So I suspect we'll continue to have some out-of-station work. Seth Seifman : Okay. Okay. And then more broadly, the comment you made at the end of the prepared remarks about potentially revisiting the guidance with the Q3 earnings. Is that because of uncertainty in any particular area or just kind of broadly across the businesses? Phebe Novakovic : I think that in this growth environment, revenue has been harder for us to predict. And just the input of contract executions and the impact of contract execution. So that's why we have a little less clarity than we typically do at this point, as revenue is a bit harder for us to identify with the kind of certainty that we typically can. Seth Seifman : Okay, very good. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ellen Page at Jefferies. Ellen Page : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just starting on the G700. You mentioned Block 3 was at a steady-state margin. How do we think about that relative to the G650? When would that kind of peak margin? Phebe Novakovic : I don't have that exact comparison, but these are going to be very healthy margins, as you can imagine, on these airplanes. Ellen Page : Okay. Thank you. And then just moving to Marine. As we think about the high growth this year, how do we think about that continuing into 2025? Or should we assume? Phebe Novakovic : So this is -- we continue to see a strong growth profile for the Marine Group for the foreseeable future. In fact, for some time to come. Driven by, as I noted before, the threat environment. So growth is continuing. Some years, it will be a higher rate of growth than others, but it is a growth trajectory. Ellen Page : Thank you. I'll leave it there. Operator : And next, we'll move to Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Good morning everyone. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Noah Poponak : Phebe, I guess if I look at the funded backlog at Gulfstream, it's been relatively flattish over the last kind of year, 1.5 years. I know you have overall good demand for the new products. But how are you thinking about matching supply to demand as you're going to ramp deliveries here? Do you have visibility that the orders will keep pace with that? Do you have any concern about taking the revenue run rate above the order rate? Phebe Novakovic : So I think we've got a very balanced plan through this year and the way we think about the market. Certainly, the pipeline supports that and has supported it. There's an awful lot of interest in these new airplanes. So I think we've planned accordingly. And I think as I tried to give you some color in the remarks, the pipeline remains strong, and that's the best indicator of near-term future growth. Noah Poponak : Okay. How far out into the future does the pipeline go in terms of your level of visibility and confidence in what the order flow will look like? Phebe Novakovic : It doesn't stand to reason that the further out you go in the future, the less your confidence is? It's actually, I think a truism. But for what we can see, we're -- we like what we see in the pipeline. Noah Poponak : Okay. And Kim, did you -- I apologize if I missed it, did you provide a new free cash flow to net income conversion goal for the year? And then, I guess just any comment on how to think about that next year if there are some abnormalities this year that reverse next year? Kimberly Kuryea : So in terms of for this year, we're still targeting the conversion rate of approaching 100%. Obviously, a lot of that cash is going to come in the fourth quarter of this year, based on our profile this year. And honestly, we are still in the planning process for next year. So we're not at the point that we're ready to give any cash flow guidance for next year. Noah Poponak : Okay, thank you. Phebe Novakovic : So Adra [ph], I think we have time for just one more question. Operator : Thank you. That question comes from Matt Akers at Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Phebe Novakovic : Good morning. Matthew Akers : There was a fire at the Camden, Arkansas facility. Can you guys comment if that was material at all and if that is back online at this point? Phebe Novakovic : Well, that was a tragedy for the individual, the family and for us. From a business perspective, it's a very small line. Matthew Akers : Got it. Thanks. And I guess if you could comment on maybe the outlook at NASSCO? Just between the repair work and you guys recently won the sub tender work there, just kind of how you see the outlook for that yard? Phebe Novakovic : So NASSCO learning and performance on the T-AO, the oiler is going quite well. We're delivering the seventh of the A-class ESB, and repair continues to be pretty strong as the demand from the U.S. Navy is increasing.

On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Phebe. Phebe N. Novakovic: Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning we have reported earnings of $3.35 per diluted share on revenue over 11.67 billion, operating earnings of 1.18 billion and net income of 930 million. Across the company revenue increased 1.1 billion, a strong 10.4% led by a 22% increase from our Aerospace segment and a 20% increase in Marine Systems. We enjoyed revenue increases at three of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter, only Combat Systems is flat. This is strong growth by any reasonable standard. Importantly operating earnings of 1.18 billion are up 124 million or 11.7%. Similarly, net earnings increased 94 million or 11.2% and earnings per share are up $0.31 or 10.2% over the year ago quarter. When earnings are up at a greater rate than revenue in a growth environment, the business is demonstrating solid operating leverage. We are doing just that. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $34.4 billion is up $3.77 billion or 12.3% over last year. Operating earnings of $3.37 billion are up 14.1%. Net earnings of $2.63 billion are up 14% despite a higher tax rate. Nevertheless, we mistreat EPS consensus by a fair amount because we were able to deliver only four G700s in the quarter. So without further ado, let me move right into aerospace and give you as much insight into this issue as I can, and its implications for the remainder of the year. At the outset, let me give you some comparative numbers that are quite good despite the shortfall of anticipated G700 delivery. Then I will put all of this in some reasonable context for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.48 billion and operating earnings of $305 million with a 12.3% operating margin. Revenue is $450 million more than last year's third quarter, a solid 22% increase. The revenue increase was driven by the four G700 deliveries, higher service center and special missions volume, and higher FBO and MRO volume, particularly in the Asia Pacific region at Jet Aviation. We delivered 28 aircrafts, including four G700s this quarter. This is 11 fewer G700s than we expected to deliver. We also delivered one less G600, G500 and G280 than we did a year ago quarter. The deliveries of these aircraft are at a reasonably steady state and the modest shortfall is a typical variance, having to do largely with timing and customer convenience. Operating earnings of $305 million are up $37 million or 13.8% over the year ago quarter. The 12.3% operating margin was 90 basis points lower than the year ago quarter for a host of reasons, including inefficiencies caused by supply chain deficiencies. So despite a very good quarter, we had planned to do better and sell side consensus reflected our expectations. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. While we planned 15 for Q2 and delivered 11, we planned 15 to 16 for Q3 and delivered four. Three weeks before the end of the quarter, we still had a reasonable belief that we would deliver at least 11 in the quarter. So what happened? Whenever we miss our forecast so badly, it is almost always for a number of reasons that all play a part, so let me identify the most important and impactful ones. First, due to the timing of engine certification, aircraft engines arrived late to schedule. We painted the aircraft before the engines arrived and then painted and installed the engines. This led to a significant amount of repaint that resulted in increased cost and time spent. Second, many of the aircraft planned for delivery in this quarter have highly customized interiors. First of tight intricacies. These intricacies are considered to be major changes for regulatory purposes. This resulted in longer-than-anticipated efforts to finalize and achieve supplemental-type certificates. Related to this, the size and complexity of the G700 cabins has also elongated the customer reviews during final delivery of these planes. Third and maybe most important, late in the quarter, a supplier quality escape on a specific component caused the exchange of several components on each planned aircraft delivery up to 16 per aircraft. The supplier is fully cooperative and is providing components for all our needs, but this rework has increased the number of test flights necessary to obtain the final certificate of airworthiness for each aircraft. So the removal and replacement of these components has impacted labor costs and schedule adversely. We are nonetheless working our way nicely through this problem with the cooperation of the vendor. Finally, if that wasn't enough, we lost four days of productivity as a result of Hurricane Helene. Several customers who were in Savannah working with us to accept delivery left and went home to avoid the storm. So given that there is always risk and precise estimates, I will describe our delivery cadence a bit later and provide some monthly forecast so that you can monitor the quarter from publicly available data. Alright, back to some good numerical comparisons. For the year-to-date, aerospace revenue is up $1.63 billion, an increase of 27.7%. Operating earnings were up $146 million, an increase of almost 20%. I recite these figures, which will reflect even more growth by the end of the year so that we do not get lost in the third quarter delivery issue. This is still eye-watering growth. So what impact should we now expect for the fourth quarter and the year given the fewer-than-planned G700 deliveries in the second quarter and third quarters. You may recall that we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year, we now expect to deliver around 42 for the year with 27 in the fourth quarter. This number is not without risk, but there's also some opportunity to bring planes forward. The real issue here is supply chain support during this critical period. Let me give you some insight into the sequencing of the 27 planned deliveries in the quarter. We anticipate five in October, nine in November and 13 in December, recognizing there is some risk as these numbers could vary a little bit up or down through the quarter. You can, as I have said, follow this with fairly accurate but not perfect publicly available data. Turning to market demand, the interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at year's end suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the fourth quarter, and that is what we are seeing. After some slowing in the U.S. during the second and third quarters, we are seeing improved interest across all models in the fourth quarter. Europe and Middle East activity is quite strong, but current activity in Southeast Asia and China has slowed. Interestingly, the overall number of prospects in all areas continues to increase. The overall number of prospects in our pipeline is at an all-time high, with the most active models being the G500, G600 and G700. We have a good cross-section of U.S. businesses in this mix. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter, albeit disappointing from the perspective of G700 deliveries. We look forward to a strong finish to the year in the fourth quarter but will fall somewhat short of our midyear forecast. So let's move on to the defense businesses. As a collective, we once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. I may walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.2 billion for the quarter, similar to a year ago. Earnings of $325 million are up 8.3% and margins at 14.7% represents a 120 basis point increase over Q3 last year. Each of the businesses increased earnings with particularly strong operating leverage in munitions and customer service businesses. On a sequential basis, while revenue decreased 3%, earnings rose almost 4%. Year-to-date, revenue of $6.6 billion is up almost 12% and earnings of $920 million are up $124 million or almost 16%. Combat saw robust order activity over $3.3 billion awarded in Q3, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio with notable orders in munitions and near defense vehicles for the U.S. Army. Overall, demand remains solid across Combat, particularly in our ordinance and international combat vehicle businesses. In the U.S., we are increasing production of 155-millimeter ammunition projectiles as well as expanding our support to the U.S. Army across several other areas, including final loading and assembly of artillery. Our Combat Systems backlog at roughly $18 billion reflects the strong demand. All in all, a strong performance quarter for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.6 billion is up $597 million, 20% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume as well as Virginia-class volume drove the growth. DDG-51 revenue also increased somewhat. Just to put this in some context, this 20% growth follows 15% growth in Q4 2023, 11% growth in Q1 of 2024, and 13% growth in Q2 of 2024, impressive growth by any standard. Operating earnings are $258 million, up $47 million over the year ago quarter, with a 20 basis point increase in operating margin. However, margins continue to be adversely affected by additional delays from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improved margin performance at NASCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 4.2% and earnings improved 5.3% in Q3 driven by volume at EB. Year-to-date, marine revenue of $10.4 billion is up 14.7% and earnings of $735 million are up 12%. So across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and earnings but stagnant margin performance. As I noted last quarter, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be severely impacted by late deliveries from major component suppliers, which has delayed schedule and is continuing to impact cost. Our out-of-sequence work on modules weighing thousands of tons is time-consuming and therefore, expensive, sometimes up to eight times the cost of in-sequence work. The operating metrics tell us that we have, in fact, increased our productivity to somewhat offset cost. As I noted last quarter, throughput, a significant measure of productivity continues to improve. And while we will continue to work on improved productivity, there is no point hurting portions of the boat only to have to stop and wait increasingly extended periods of time for major components to arrive. It is not good for the bulk over time nor cost. Given the recent projections from the supply chain on deliveries, we need to get our cadence in sync with the supply chain and take costs out of the business if we are to hope to see incremental margin growth. Put another way, the supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped. Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers. Finally, to be clear, current submarine delivery projections are not incrementally impacted since they already reflect the anticipated delays from the supply chain. We will, of course, carefully monitor supply chain performance and accelerate our work should their deliveries to us improve. And lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of almost $3.4 billion, which is up 2% over the prior year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $326 million, up 3.5% on a margin of 9.7%. That is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. The year-to-date comparisons are similar. Revenue at $9.9 billion is up 1.2%, but earnings of $941 million are up almost 5% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The growth for this quarter and the first nine months was driven by GDIT's investments in their digital accelerators. Mission Systems was flat year-over-year as they continue to transition from legacy programs to new franchises. Strong operating performance across the group more than offset the relative growth in services of GDIT compared to hardware at Mission Systems. Sequentially, the group grew 2.5%, spread relatively evenly over both businesses with margins steady at 9.7%. Order activity was particularly strong in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1, that resulted in backlog at the end of the quarter of $14.4 billion, up 13.5% from the year ago quarter. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 more than keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. GDIT and Mission Systems have shared in the robust order activity so far this year, demonstrating the strength of this portfolio and prospects remain strong with a large qualified funnel of more than $120 billion in opportunities they are pursuing across the group. That concludes my comments about the defense businesses. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Kim Kuryea, and then we'll wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year. Kimberly A. Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. Combat Systems and Technologies led the way with book-to-bill of 1.5 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This order activity led to our backlog increasing to $92.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a record level of $137.6 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another good story in the quarter. Cash flow improved as anticipated over the prior two quarters. We produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow. All segments contributed to the results with particularly strong cash generation in technologies. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, or 131% of net income. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting free cash flow to again be greater than 100% of net income, but we now expect the full year to fall short of our 100% conversion target as G700 deliveries pushed into 2025. As a reminder, total free cash flow generation between 2021 and 2023 was quite strong with a three-year conversion rate of 107%. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $201 million in the quarter or 1.7% of sales. We're still targeting to be around 2% of sales for the full year given the commitments that remain. We paid $390 million in dividends and repurchased a little over 150,000 shares of stock for $44 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.2 billion, down over $700 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $248 million, down from $265 million for the same period in 2023. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 17%. The rate was slightly lower than expected, principally due to increased U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other timing items. As a result, for the year, we believe our full year tax rate will be closer to 17%. Now let me turn it back over to Phebe for some final remarks. Phebe N. Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. In light of the things I have just discussed, let me give you some clarity for the remainder of the year. The figures I am about to give you are all compared to our July update, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we expect sales to be about $12.3 billion with a 13.2% margin. We are expecting 150 versus 160 deliveries with 10 of the deliveries slipping into next year. This will, of course, benefit next year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems and Technology remain unchanged from July. Marine Systems revenue should be about $13.9 billion with margins of 6.9% for all the reasons I've previously noted. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of around $48 billion and margins of around 10.3%. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of approximately $14 per share, about $0.45 below our previous expectations. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Nicole Shelton : Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Seth Seifman at J.P. Morgan. Seth Seifman : Hey, hi, thanks and good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning Seth. Seth Seifman : Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this year is kind of an unusual year in terms of the various things that have come up with the G700. But as we think about going forward and where the profitability can go in the Aerospace segment, I know it's early for 2025, but maybe even qualitatively talking about the things that are weighing down margin this year and how things can evolve taking into account also the introduction of the G800 and kind of what the progression looks like? Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think as we've discussed through most of this year, we still have supply chain challenges that require -- at Gulfstream that require out of station work, and we still have late deliveries of material. The supply chain has gotten much better as evidenced by our ability to ramp up production, but they still got ways to go. And until we get that supply chain quality as well as delivery timing stabilized, we'll continue to have out of station work. That, however, should be behind us before too terribly long let's talk about the 700. So the 700 we've talked throughout the year about some of the margin pressures of the first lot, but when we look forward, as we've talked about before, we see gross margin improvement of about 600 to 700 basis points, that remains the same. As I look forward in the Aerospace Group, we see very, very strong margins going forward and we'll see good margins in Q4, not as high as we expected because a lot of 700s was into next year, but we'll have very nice margin expansion as we go through into next year. With respect to the 800, we expect it to come out of the blocks pretty good and have some nice margin impacts over the course of its year. So I would say that we're pretty optimistic over -- starting about next year and into the future of the margin performance at Aerospace. Seth Seifman : Okay, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on Combat, with the -- understand the growth trajectory kind of slowing down here in the second half, how much of that reflects kind of the end of the facilitization process for the 155-millimeter shells and how do we think about kind of the interplay of growth and margin going forward, it would seem that the backlog here would allow this to be, as we look across the industry, maybe one of the faster growing businesses across the industry, is that a fair assessment? And then have we -- has this quarter indicated that some of the margin pressure from facilitization is behind us? Phebe N. Novakovic: So look, if we look at our backlog and the threat environment and the performance at Combat in general, over time, I think we expected in our market space we will continue to grow and perform very well. Facilitization for increased munition production is largely behind us. We're moving into production. We'll see increased revenue from our combat vehicle business and so we do see a pretty good solid growth pattern as we go forward. This year, we accelerated growth into the first half so we expect fourth quarter to be relatively flat but still have about 5.9% growth for the group in the year. And we expect to see very nice growth going forward. I would add this, in a high-performing organization like Combat Systems, variability in revenue and margin is almost always a question of timing, so just to give you a little context on that score. Operator : We'll move next to Robert Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much, good morning. Phebe N. Novakovic: Good morning. Robert Stallard : First of all, a question on Marine, Phebe, you mentioned about the supply chain issues there. I was wondering if you could elaborate on why it's not improved as much as you would have hoped and also at what point does this start to negatively impact submarine schedules? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that it already has impacted schedule and that's been pretty well publicized by the Navy. Until recently, we had a reasonable hope, and it was a reasonable set of expectations based on the indicators that the supply chain would continue to get better. But most recently, we've seen that, in fact, that's not the case. And they're not getting better at the rate at which we had hoped for a whole series of reasons. And I think that and some of those have been very well documented, the Navy and Congress have been well aware of that. So they've been pumping additional support into the parts of the supply chain and some parts are doing well, but others are continuing to struggle. And I'd say that it was not a typical number of manufacturing sectors. If you go back from December of 2019, the PPI for manufacturing has increased by 25%. Overlay that with the demographic challenges that we've had with the smaller cohort of new hires and wage growth that span and added pressure on some of our suppliers at the same time, almost quintupling the throughput on -- and the demand on submarines. So there's been a lot of pressure, parts of the supply chain. I think that's well understood by our customer and the Congress. So we're going to continue to work with them and help where we can. But in the meantime, we're going to control what we can control. And that is we're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see as more predictable supply chain schedules that have elongated. It will take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the debt plates [ph] with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce. So you can control what you can control, and we're simply in the moment adjusting to what we see as the inability of the supply chain to improve at the rate that we had hoped and that frankly I believe our customer had hoped. Robert Stallard : Yes. And just as a quick follow-up, do you think the supply chain issues jeopardize the aspiration to move back to two boats a year on the Virginia-class? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that in the short term, there's going to be pressure on that, considerable pressure on that. So I think that's something for us to work through with our customer and, frankly, the customer to work with the supply chain. I think it's a well-known issue. Operator : We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Thanks, good morning. Phebe, if I could follow up on Rob's question there. The implied fourth quarter margin at mid-6% range for Marine, is there something in the third quarter positively offsetting to get to the low 7s, I don't know if there's a positive EAC you might have taken? And then looking to 2025, is the mid-6% margin, the right run rate that you're looking for now in that business? Phebe N. Novakovic: So this quarter, we had some strong performance out of NASCO. We had some good performance at Electric Boat. But that's going to, in this environment, vary quarter-by-quarter. So we anticipate some more supply chain impacts in the fourth quarter. And as we project next year, and I'll give you that clarity about in our regular order in January but as we project next year, the ability to continue to drive incremental margins in the short-term is just how fast we can take our pace down at cost and improve our productivity. So we'll work through all that with the shipyard and give you a sense of what we're seeing in margins. I'd say they are going to be kind of lumpy probably through next year and maybe even beyond. Myles Walton : Okay. And then one clarification. I know it's super granular and near term, so I apologize in advance. But in October to date, have you gotten more than one G7 out the door? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes, I think I was -- yes, we have. And I think I've given you some pretty good clarity of what we expect for October. That's pretty much on schedule. And then November and December, I gave you that clarity as well. I'm trying to be as transparent with you all so that you can better understand where we anticipate and as you well know, you can follow some of that with publicly available data, which is directionally correct. Operator : We'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning. Phebe, following up on the items that you highlight in terms of what's impacting the G700 delivery. I guess just to clarify, is roles from an engine perspective, are they behind, is that part of the issue? And then on the interior side, do you view this as kind of a temporary issue or could it linger just given a much larger cabin here, and I would assume a lot more in the way of complexity on the interior side on a go-forward basis? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we control the interiors. So we're very comfortable in our projections on how we work those interiors. So I don't -- I'm not worried or even concerned about our interiors. Engines on stations have improved, so that is definitely a benefit. And I tried to give you some color around that particular issue in my remarks, but there's improvement. David Strauss : Okay. And a quick follow-up. The [indiscernible] announcement with partnership with Lockheed in the quarter. Can you just give some color around that and how that might materialize over the next couple of years in terms of numbers? Thanks. Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we'll make some investment over the next couple of years. And then I think that -- and I don't have an exact start date off the tip of my tongue. But a lot of the number of motors will be driven by -- overall by the demand for the rock that itself, but we're pretty comfortable that this is well within our capability set, and we'll work through that with our partner. David Strauss : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird. Peter Arment : Hey good morning Phebe. Phebe, maybe just to focus on Combat, you guys have had really strong growth through the first three quarters of the year, and you're obviously -- your profit margins reflect a lot of really good execution. Just how are you thinking about just kind of the long-term visibility here, how big of a business do you see in terms of the bookings environment, you mentioned Middle East and Europe, maybe just describe, I think, how you're seeing the visibility on Combat? Phebe N. Novakovic: So our book-to-bill and backlog supports nice growth. The unfortunate threat environment also continues to drive demand. And we see our pipeline is pretty robust, but domestically and outside the United States. So at least for the foreseeable future, we see nice steady growth in Combat. [Multiple Speakers] with good margin performance. Peter Arment : Yes. Then my follow-up is on the margin front, I mean almost 14% for the first nine months. I mean, is there opportunities to further enhance margins, I know there are some limits here and mix is a factor, but you've got a lot of growth and a lot of us are just focused on kind of what actually this business can generate? Phebe N. Novakovic: So historically, this -- when we've talked about this before in previous calls over the years, this tends to be a 14.5% margin business given some margin variability quarter-to-quarter, again, largely driven by mix. And I suspect that will continue in that range. Again, some margins will be better. Could we make long-term incremental structural improvement in that. I don't see that at the moment, but there's always opportunity. So we'll continue to pursue this. As I said, this is a -- this has always been a very high operating leverage company. So -- and groups of company, the three of them. So I think we'll continue to see both nice growth and good earnings expansion. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein at Bank of America. Ronald Epstein : Good morning. So maybe back to the supply chain. If we look at the supply chain for the shipyards, I mean, we all kind of know that's been an issue. And if we look at the land systems business, I mean it's growing. Do you worry about the supply chain there and I guess, broadly, what has the supply chain in your munitions business and the businesses that are growing in land systems doing better than the supply chain in the shipyards? Phebe N. Novakovic: So I think it's a function of the type of material that we use in Combat Systems versus the scope, size of the material and inputs we use both at Marine Group and particularly submarine and Gulfstream. I mean, Gulfstream supply chain got perturbated by a lot of factors that have been well reported. But I think it's really a question of just the types of materials we use and the overall demand even outside of the Combat particularly vehicle business that tends to be a more robust supply chain on component parts given that there's other uses for a lot of that material. Materials, the inputs for Aerospace and for Gulfstream and the Marine Group are one of a kind. They don't replicate anywhere else in industry. So I think that, that explains why we've had fewer issues. I mean we had some issues with supply at Combat, but those are largely behind us. And I think that I tried to give you some color on what that is. Ronald Epstein : Yes. And then maybe as a follow-on, back to Marine, sorry, I know it's what everybody is focusing on at the moment. When we look at Marine, you say supply chain, supply chain is a huge thing, right? And I think we all have a good understanding in Aero where the type points are. And what in Marine is the issue, I mean, what kind of component -- if you just kind of broadly want to understand if we peel back the onion, where are the suppliers not supplying, is it bearing -- what is it? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, we have a number of smaller parts that remain -- they get produced by single-source suppliers and often small ones, that remain a bit of -- remain an issue. I think it's a large component parts that -- and I think the navy has reported on some of that, that tend to be highly complex. Costs have risen significantly, and you've got green workforce in a lot of these areas. So those are -- it's a large group. I think that's all I'm about the most color I'm going to give you on where some of the challenges are because the navy has been kind of explicit in some instances about that. And I think that's just a better place to be. Operator : We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC Capital Markets. Kenneth Herbert : Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, Phebe, on services within Aerospace, you had nice growth here again. You've sort of reset, it looks like at a sort of a much higher level. I know you've added capacity. Is this a good run rate to think about for the services business within this and maybe if you could talk about how dilutive this part of the business is relative to the aircraft side within this segment? Phebe N. Novakovic: So we have long said that services is going to grow at the rate of the fleet expansion. And think about it this way, we gather -- we garner between 85% and 90% plus of all Gulfstream service. And so as the fleet expands, service expands. Its impact on overall margins tends to be rather lumpy, but it is in some instances in some quarters, it's about even, so it's certainly not any large dilution impact and hasn't been for some time. So this is a nice, steady growth business. Kenneth Herbert : Okay. And on the quality escape, I guess, with how deliveries are trending in this month and your confidence, you feel good about that risk getting retired or is there anything -- it sounds like there is clearly still some caution into the back half of the year, but do you feel good about that particular supplier and getting back on schedule? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. They're working very cooperatively with us, but I think it's emblematic or at least descriptive of the fact that we don't have all of these risks behind us and that we're slipping airplanes into next year. So I've tried to give you my best estimate both on cadence and timing and of what we see, but for the remainder of this year and then as I said, some of these airplanes will go into next year. But we've worked well with the supplier, understand the scope. So that is not any particularly long-term issue, nor is it a complete anomaly just in terms of the type of thing that happened here. So we're just fixing that in the regular order. It was a timing problem, but not a systemic one, think about it that way. Kenneth Herbert : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Good morning, thank you. Going back to Marine and Electric Boat. When you look at the supply chain issues there and the delays in the programs, how do you think of the Virginia-class and Columbia-class in a sense separately, how do you prioritize work or are you making decisions to prioritize one over the other? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, that is a national security decision dictated by the Navy. So Columbia has across the entirety of the industrial base priority, and it has since its inception. So yes, so by definition, Virginia gets behind in terms of priority Columbia. And that has ramifications for Virginia. It's well understood by our customer, particularly in an environment in which supply chain material is constrained. Columbia gets the first of the pick, again, given its national security imperative. Douglas Harned : Well, given the importance of these programs, not just to Navy, but the overall Defense, you have got money in the supplemental for supporting the shipbuilding industrial base. But when you work with your customer, how is that helping and are there subsequent steps that can be taken within the budget to help build this industrial base better? Phebe N. Novakovic: So the Navy and the Congress have recognized that there are portions of the industrial base that need help. And that's what the shipbuilding and submarine industrial-based funding is attended to address both expanding the capacity and shoring up the capacity. There has been significant cost growth, as I noted earlier, across manufacturing business in particular and by extension into the submarine industrial base. So costs are increasing. Back to life cost or economic realities. And the funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in inputs and that will need to happen over time. Douglas Harned : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So just to follow up on Marine. I know that you guys are in negotiations with the Navy on the Columbia-class, five of those, and I think it's 10 or 12 Virginia-class boat. I was curious what sort of your expectation is for the timing of when those contracts get agreed to and is there any cash or margin implications once those are signed to what's in the yard now and just if you could talk about that? Phebe N. Novakovic: So cash, no. Margin impact happens over time as we begin to execute those programs. I don't have a good sense of timing. I expect that the FY 2024 ships that are not yet under contract maybe in the next few months. But I don't have a good sense of timing for the remainder of the negotiations on Block 6, the contract on Block 6 or Built 2 of Columbia. It's going to be hard to get those contracts under -- the ships under contract, given that we've had the kind of cost increases in inputs, frankly, throughout the economy. But as I noted earlier, manufacturing PPI high, and those costs have increased for inputs. So we're going to have to work that with our customer and Congress. Gautam Khanna : Just as a follow-up, I guess what I'm asking is, do you -- is there any expectation that there would be relief provided for higher labor inflation you've -- that everyone's experienced on boats that are already in production as perhaps part of that negotiation? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, I don't know if part of that negotiation, I wouldn't link it necessarily to those negotiations, but we are constantly in negotiation with our customer on a whole -- on any number of contracting actions and now is no different. We also have entitlements in our contracts for which we will seek remedy. So there's a lot of ongoing discussions with our customer about these costs these fact-of-life cost increases and labor cost increases. And that plus the remedy to which we're entitled. We're going to continue to work both of those issues with our customers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gavin Parsons at UBS. Gavin Parsons : Thanks, good morning. Phebe, you of course have delivered some G700s out of inventory this year and maybe some out of inventory again next year. Can you help us with what the underline\u2026? Phebe N. Novakovic: We are out of inventory. Help me with what you mean by out of inventory. I mean, we don't have 700 in inventory. And 700 that are in some stage of production, but just picking a nit there with you. Ronald Epstein : Yes, fair. I guess can you help us with the underlying production rate? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I try to be as explicit as I could be for the remainder of the year. Some of these airplanes will go into next year, that will help next year. And then we'll give you a lot of clarity around what next year looks like in our ordinary course when we give you our guidance in January. The airplane is performing very well. But we still, as I've noted, frequently, we still got out of station work, that needs to get behind us. Ronald Epstein : Okay. And I'll try one more. I don't know if this is just an accounting question, but you called out all the elevated cost on paint interiors component replacement on G700. How does the 600 to 700 basis point margin step-up remain intact? Phebe N. Novakovic: Well, that will happen. I don't have exact clarity on when those gross margin improvements will happen, but I think relatively soon and over the course of potentially the next year, we have to see some really nice margin expansion. We're seeing it in the fourth quarter right off the bat. And I expect to see that margin expansion continue throughout next year and beyond. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gursky at Citi. Jason Gursky : Hello there, good morning everybody. I was wondering if you could just step back for minute and maybe talk a little bit about the things that you're most excited about and where you are kind of spending the most amount of your time as it relates to technology investments and the business development pipeline across...? Phebe N. Novakovic: In technology? Jason Gursky : In -- across the defense business as a whole. Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I would say that we need to continue to capitalize on the very strong growth profile we see going forward in the Marine Group. We spend an awful lot of time on improving our own capability within our own shipyards. I think the technologies group, in general, has shown nice growth and they have positioned themselves in faster currents within their highly competitive businesses. So we're pretty excited about what we see there. And then I think Combat Systems performance continues to be strong and how we then translate demand into revenue in the out years and continue the strong operating performance we've had there is sort of where we focus our time. There's a lot to be excited about in terms of performance of the company. Jason Gursky : Yes, understood. Okay. It's helpful to understand the prioritization. And then maybe this is a question where we get Kim involved as well, but just kind of philosophically how you guys are -- how you all, excuse me, are approaching the balance sheet and the capital structure and leverage. I'm just kind of -- as we think about the future of the company, where you want to operate? Kimberly A. Kuryea: Yes. Well, Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet. We were recently upgraded in terms of our credit rating, and we have some debt repayments coming due that we expect to pay on schedule, and we'll consistently look at where we stand, but we feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Jason Gursky : Right. And just philosophically, you want to keep your leverage under externs of leverage. I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I don't think at this point in time, I think we're continuing to work the growth environment that we're in and determining in terms of where the cash is going to come out for 2025, especially. And I think it's a matter of time in terms of taking a look at where we stand. So Audrey, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take that question from Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Phebe, just to clarify your response to David's question earlier, do the certifications you're getting this year on those highly customized interiors for G700, do those derisk this as an item from being a constraint next year? Phebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I mean these are the first ones out of the block. So we don't see that as a constraining item next year. Does that answer the question? Scott Deuschle : Yes, does Combat Systems have many products that are approved for export on a direct commercial sale basis and then are you seeing much traction for DCS sales, either in terms of the bookings you put up recently at Combat or in terms of orders that are in the pipeline? Phebe N. Novakovic: Not out of the United States, but out of our European businesses, yes, those tend to be direct sales, and that's been true for 25 years. And the demand for those products in Europe, in Eastern and Western Europe remains very, very strong. Scott Deuschle : Thank you. Nicole Shelton : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
