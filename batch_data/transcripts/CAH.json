[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin. Sally Curley : Thank you, Nicole, and welcome to Cardinal Health's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements, and the matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation, found on the Investors page of our website for a description of those risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures is included at the end of the slide. I would also like to remind you of a few upcoming investment conferences and events in which we will be webcasting. Notably, the Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 8 a.m. Eastern on November 6 at our headquarters here in Dublin, Ohio; and our invitation-only Investor and Analyst Day on December 10 in New York. The details of these webcasts and events are or will be posted on the IR section of our website at cardinalhealth.com, so please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We look forward to seeing you in the upcoming events. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett: Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone. Our fiscal 2014 is off to a very strong start. Our first quarter performance demonstrated growth and balance and progress on our key strategic priorities. There's a lot to discuss so let's get right to it. Total revenue for the first quarter was $24.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year as we lapped the loss of the Express Scripts business and absorbed the expiration of our Walgreens contract, which occurred at the end of August. We were able to partially offset this revenue loss with growth in existing customers and the contribution from new business. Our non-GAAP EPS grew by 36% to $1.10, helped by an $0.18 benefit from the resolution of some historical tax matters. Looking deeper, the results show we achieved a very healthy 13% growth in non-GAAP operating earnings, fueled by strong margin expansion and operating profit increases in both our pharmaceutical and medical segments. For those of you keeping score, our year-over-year gross margin rate has expanded every quarter for the past 3 years. We also had an outstanding cash flow performance, generating $950 million in the quarter. Importantly, the wind down of the Walgreens work was done very efficiently and effectively. Our team did an outstanding job. They were able to dramatically reduce our inventory while maintaining the uncompromisingly high service levels we expect and Walgreens worked closely with us to ensure a smooth transition for us and we do appreciate that. The bottom line, our balance sheet is rock-solid and our growth is very healthy. We are well-positioned to continue growing and to seize quality opportunities wherever they emerge. Based on our first quarter results and the strength of our operating earnings performance, we are now guiding to a new range of $3.62 to $3.72 for fiscal year 2014 non-GAAP EPS. This guidance reflects a full year tax rate assumption that is unchanged from our original expectations, although we do expect to see some quarterly fluctuations in the rate and Jeff will give you some more detail on this. I'm sure all of you saw this morning our announcement of the authorization of a new multiyear share repurchase program for $1 billion. This will allow us flexibility as we execute our balanced capital deployment philosophy. I'd also like to take a few minutes to give you my perspective on recent moves in the marketplace. The world is rapidly changing and no industry more so than health care. In these past 18 months, we witnessed and participated ourselves in several noteworthy realignments in our industry. Clearly, last week's announcement that McKesson is acquiring Celesio is the most recent. For our part, we try to bring our collective experience and insights to the moves that make us stronger and better positioned. We will be uncompromising in our commitment to uphold and grow a decisive competitive advantage and top-tier returns for our shareholders. Many factors contribute to our sustainable competitive advantage, but I'd like to call your attention to a few. First, our unrivaled touch points across an increasingly integrating system will be more efficient, effective and connected across the continuum of care. Second, we have the size and impact to create benefits for our customers and to create clear share opportunities from manufacturer partners. Third, we deliver a world-class execution. This is a standard against which we will constantly measure ourselves. And finally, we are an organization with the unwavering discipline, imagination and the flexibility to bring solutions to systems badly in need of them. By the way, I'm hearing some beeping. I'm hoping that everyone is able to hear us. I'm going to continue on, assuming that beeping is not getting in the way of things. All this requires having a capital and a flexible capital deployment strategy to compete in the world going through a rapid change. These things are all strengths of Cardinal Health and we can use periods of industry change to expand them. As always, we'll thoroughly evaluate all options to expand our competitive advantage and deliver even better returns and we'll continue to take options for growth available to us. We are ready to move and we'll do so decisively when the lights are green. But we will follow a simple principle with discipline, any decision we make must deliver meaningful and lasting value to our customers, our supplier partners and to our shareholders. Not all opportunities that present themselves are created equally. It's our responsibility to know the difference and act accordingly and you should expect nothing less of us. Now on to the segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered robust profit growth of 8%, on an expected revenue decline. Our segment margin expanded by 29 basis points. Our growth in both new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers reflects the value that we've been bringing to them through both our branded and generic programs. Our pharma margin was further expanded by our continued progress on our sourcing programs and our product and customer mix initiatives. Our pharma team continues to perform well in the retail independent space and we see continued market share growth. As you know, this has been an area of focus over the past few years and we remain deeply committed to retail pharmacy. We're continuing to see steep revenue growth in Specialty Solutions and we're picking up new accounts at an excellent pace, especially in the oncology services and distribution area. In addition, we've been adding to our clinical talent base in specialty and we're seeing the benefits. Our thesis in Specialty Solutions is that we can create significant value in connecting providers, payors and biopharmaceutical companies in collaborative ways that result in better patient care at lower cost that will be central to specialty pharmaceutical care and that's why it's at the core of our specialty model. The environment around nuclear imaging remains challenging, but our Nuclear business continues to adapt effectively to market conditions. The Medical segment performance was strong. Revenue was up 13% to $2.7 billion and segment profit increased 43%. The key driver was AssuraMed, which accelerated that growth and we also saw volume growth in our existing customer base and penetration within our targeted strategic accounts. Investments in strategic platforms and a strong focus on our efficiency initiatives also contributed to a sharp segment profit increase compared to a year ago. Building our preferred product portfolio remains a top priority. It's an example of what makes Cardinal Health tick. We listen to our customers and then act. Their needs and expectations drive our decisions. The preferred product portfolio addresses our customers' need for lower-cost alternatives to mature medical devices. In fact, we introduced more new preferred products in this fiscal first quarter than we did all of last year. Our priority is to be ready and able to meet changing needs, so we've adapted our go-to-market model to ensure we're 100% aligned with market trends. As a result, we're getting more products to more patients more cost-effectively throughout the continuum of care. In line with this, the trend toward home health care is unlikely to diminish with today's strong focus on cost containment and greater health care consumerism. Our March 2013 acquisition of AssuraMed, the leading distributor of medical products to the home, gives us a tremendous platform through which to move into this market. AssuraMed is performing well, with profit contribution exceeding the acquisition model. The expected synergies and efficiency gains are being realized. We are only just beginning to leverage this platform across the Cardinal Health organization. Our Medical segment continues to innovate. This past Tuesday, we jointly announced with FedEx our new strategic alliance by combining our health care expertise, third-party logistics capabilities and specialized facilities. With FedEx's global transportation, logistics and technology capabilities, we will offer tailor-made, third-party logistics and supply chain solutions for the health care industry. Turning to China. First quarter revenues were up nearly 30% year-over-year. Our strategy here remains to enlarge our geographic footprint, to create new business partnerships and to bring our expertise to new opportunities such as direct-to-patient and consumer health. A lot has been happening in China and Jeff will touch on that in a moment, but one thing is totally clear, health care in China will continue to grow. We're very well positioned to play in a central role in this rapidly expanding health care marketplace. As you know, we've made several acquisitions in China over the past 2 years, largely focused on building out our geographic footprint. Most recently, we closed on an acquisition that will broaden our capabilities and will give us a platform to begin building out an e-commerce business for nonprescription products. This platform will be used as both a B2C platform and in conjunction with a rapidly expanding direct-to-patient pharmacy network. As I finish up today, let me make a few quick comments in the Affordable Care Act. As is well documented at this point, the rollout of the exchanges has experienced its challenges. As you remember, we've been clear from the start that we were not building into our guidance any upside based on short-term expectations for new volume in the system. This is a major piece of legislation, we recognize that these are early days and that the opening pitch has just been thrown. We're going to stay on top of this and we'll be ready for whatever comes next. I'll conclude by welcoming Patricia Hemingway Hall, President and CEO of Health Care Services Corporation, to our Board of Directors. Pat has built a distinguished career on both the provider and payor side of the industry and we look forward to the wealth of knowledge she'll bring to our board. I also want to thank Jean Spaulding, who'll be stepping down from our board next week. Her insight and guidance over the past 11 years have been invaluable. Her legacy will be lasting and we wish her well. So again, we're off to a great start to fiscal 2014. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, George, and Happy Halloween, everyone. In case you're wondering, I am dressed as a Canadian today. This morning, I'll be reviewing the drivers of first quarter performance and provide additional detail on the full year, as well as our somewhat atypical decision to raise the fiscal 2014 guidance range after only our first quarter. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share in our first quarter versus the prior year's period. This is driven by 2 major items. First and most importantly, we began fiscal '14 with great execution across our businesses, posting a 13% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings. Second, our results include an unusual tax benefit of $0.18 per share. Even excluding the $0.18, non-GAAP earnings per share grew a robust 14%, a great quarter of growth. Let me go through the rest of the income statement in a little bit more detail, starting with revenues. Consolidated sales were down 5% to $24.5 billion, which was better than our expectations. The decline was due to the expiration of the Express Scripts contract, which we have now fully lapped and the Walgreens business, which just ended on August 31. Gross margin dollars increased 9% to 5.15% of revenue, with a rate of 68 basis points versus prior year. SG&A expenses rose 6% in Q1, primarily driven by the recent AssuraMed acquisition and partially offset by planned efficiency initiatives. Our commitment to controlling costs and improving the efficiency of our operations resulted in a decrease in our core SG&A spend versus the same period last year. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 36 basis points to 2.17%. We've now posted operating margins greater than 2% in 3 of the last 4 quarters. You'll notice that our net interest and other expense came in higher in Q1 than the prior year's quarter. This is primarily due to the new $1.3 billion of debt we issued in February associated with the AssuraMed acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% versus the prior year's 37.8%. The uncharacteristically low rate was primarily due to beneficial tax settlements totaling $63 million in the quarter. Please note, this amount only affects our tax line and has no impact on operating earnings or segment results. Without those discrete items, our tax rate for the quarter would've been about 37%, much more in line with our normal rate. I'll discuss tax assumptions for the full year later in my prepared remarks. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 343.7 million for the first quarter, which is about 700,000 favorable to last year. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million worth of shares. And at the end of the period, we had $350 million remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. Today, as George mentioned, we announced that our board authorized a new repurchase program for $1 billion. This plan is in addition to the $350 million remaining under our previous plan. Now let's discuss the consolidated cash flows and the balance sheet. We generated $950 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, which greatly exceeded our expectations. There were 2 major factors that contributed to this strong cash flow generation. First, our strong underlying operating earnings performance; and second, the wind down of the Walgreens contract, which contributed over half of the first quarter's cash flow, as we reduced inventory levels significantly and faster than we originally anticipated. Given this accelerated wind down, we would not expect to see a similar level of cash flow contribution in the second quarter. On the Walgreens unwind, I echo George's comment and thank our team who ensured that we exited the Walgreens contract smoothly, balancing extremely high service levels with a rapid reduction in inventory. Moving on. At the end of Q1, we had $2.8 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes $475 million held internationally. While our working capital days decreased versus prior year, I would like to note that our working capital metrics are distorted this quarter due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract in mid-period. We don't believe these metrics provide meaningful measures compared to the prior year's period and, therefore, we'll not be providing these metrics in the quarter. Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss pharma first. Pharma segment revenue came in better than expected, although it did post a decrease of 7% to $21.8 billion, driven by the expiration of the Express Scripts and Walgreens contracts. This decrease was partially offset by volume growth from new and existing customers. As a reminder, we lapped the Express Scripts contract expiration this quarter. And given the August 31 Walgreens contract expiration, revenue from Walgreens was $1.7 billion less than the prior year's quarter. Pharma segment profit increased by 8% to $433 million due to contributions from across our businesses, with strong performance from both our generics and brand product portfolios. Given the nature of the wind down of the Walgreens contract, the expiration did not significantly impact our operating earnings compared to the prior year period. We do expect the contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our period-over-period comparison results of operations during the remainder of this fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal '15. This has been incorporated in our fiscal 2014 guidance assumption, which I'll discuss in a moment. With respect to generics, we did, as expected, we lapped contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus Q1 of fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, sales and profits from all generic programs exhibited very good year-over-year growth in the quarter, reflecting the emphasis we have placed over the last several years building the strength of our programs and the overall robustness of the market. Sequentially from Q4, generic deflation moderated slightly from the lower-single digits to essentially flat. We also saw strong performance under our branded pharma contracts, with brand inflation in the low-double digits, about or perhaps slightly better than we had expected. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 29 basis points compared to the prior year's Q1, a reflection of the strength of our generics programs and our focus on margin expansion, including customer and product mix. In addition, within customer categories, margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was strong across almost all of our customer class of trade. Now moving on to Medical segment performance. Medical revenue growth was up 13% versus last year, an increase of $319 million. The AssuraMed acquisition was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. We also saw volume growth from our existing customer base, a result of our continued focus on strategic hospital network accounts, which tend to utilize more of our products and services to drive efficiency in their supply chain. Medical segment profit grew 43% in Q1, primarily driven by AssuraMed. As George said, the integration is on track and we continue to be excited about the growth we've seen in the home health market and the potential of the AssuraMed platform. I will note that we remain very confident in our original estimate of achieving at least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. Other factors positively impacting segment profit included contribution from planned efficiency initiatives and growth in our preferred products portfolio. Now I have a few words on Cardinal Health China, a business which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China again posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 29%. While we're on the subject of China, let me take a few more moments to comment on the environment as we see it. First, although we continue to see news around the slowing of industrial growth in China, the health care market in China is growing and will continue to grow at rates well in excess of GDP growth rates. Demographic changes, lifestyle trend, the expansion of health insurance programs and the government's pledge to support the development are all factors that make health care in China an attractive place to be. Second, the recent compliance investigations by the government authorities are affecting the promotional activities of certain pharma companies and we expect this to moderate growth in the near term. However, we continue to remain bullish on medium- to longer-term growth and, in particular, our ability to build on our unique brand of supply chain excellence, integrity and service offerings. Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduced our GAAP results by $0.11 per share compared to non-GAAP. Diluted is $0.09 of amortization and acquisition-related costs, which reflects $0.08 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Also included in this figure is $0.02 of restructuring and employee severance. In Q1 of last year, GAAP results were $0.02 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily related to amortization and other acquisition-related costs. Now I'll talk briefly about guidance for the current fiscal year. As you know, we provided an initial guidance range in our August call of $3.45 to $3.60. Given the strong operating performance in Q1, we're now raising our range to $3.62 to $3.72. I will add that it's unusual for us to update guidance this early in our fiscal year given the amount of time that's still ahead of us. However, this year, we have made an exception due to our first quarter results and the strength of our operating earnings performance. Most of the underlying corporate assumptions remain unchanged from our previous comments. However, I do want to mention a few points. First, we're not changing the full year expected tax rate range of approximately 34.5% to 36% that we provided in August because it's really impossible that the favorable impact of the first quarter tax settlements could largely be offset by unfavorable discrete items in future quarters of fiscal 2014. Put another way, quarterly tax rates will fluctuate throughout the year, but we expect our full year rate to end up somewhere within the original range we provided. Let me be clear, our changing guidance is unrelated to taxes. Second, we're essentially holding our anticipated diluted weighted average shares outstanding less than or equal to 343 million for the year. Although I don't like to telegraph exactly what we may do regarding share repurchases, I will say that, at a minimum, we'll offset dilution. And our existing authorization, combined with the new board approval, gives us ample flexibility as the year progresses. Third, we reduced our interest and other assumption by $5 million and now assume a range of $140 million to $150 million. Finally, with regards to cash flow and as I noted earlier, we were able to realize the majority -- another majority of the working capital benefit from the Walgreens transition in Q1. This positive cash flow will be partially offset by the continued after-tax loss earnings and a LIFO-related cash tax impact later this year. The timing of all these moving parts, as a result, we're seeing most of the positive cash flow early in the year, while we expect the offsets to occur through the remainder of the year. We continue to project that all these moving parts will net to more than $500 million of cash flow for the year. In closing, I would like to thank the Cardinal Health team for a very strong start to fiscal '14. It is exciting to achieve these levels of growth and margin expansion and it only happens with the hard work and dedication of our employees. I'm optimistic about the rest the year of as we continue to build on our strategic priorities. And I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at our Investor and Analyst Day on December 10. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So I guess, in the pharma business, maybe just to start with the quarter, can you talk a bit about sort of what you've experienced in the independent channel? Obviously, you sort of been in transition there for a number of years post the Kinray buy. It seems like you have a lot of momentum, the customer base, you've really done increasingly better with. There was a big conference recently. What's sort of been your experience there and how would you think your growth rates kind of compare to market? George S. Barrett: Yes, look, as you know, we've devoted a lot of energy and a lot of resource in recent years to our retail customer base and diversifying that base, as you know. And I think the commitment is paying off. We've attracted talent to focus in this area. Our offerings are broader, are more creative, allow them to compete. That's not just in the Pharmaceutical side, that's in the front end, that's in other tools, for example, in helping them set up a diabetes center in stores. So I think we're building capabilities, I think, that set of customers feel that from us and I think they recognize that we are focusing. So I would say that we have probably expanded our market share a bit, but I'll probably not attribute it to a single thing. I think it's really sort of a comprehensive effort that has been going on for now a good 4-plus years. And Mike Coffman and his team have done a great job of strengthening our position in that side of the market. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And you touched upon at the beginning, there's obviously a lot of change going on in the industry. A lot of it in terms of the investor focus continues to be on the procurement of generics, obviously, something you have a unique perspective on given your background. I mean, as you think about the way you're contracting in markets today and the changes you've made to sort of your generic strategy over time, what are the key things you're thinking about as your peers continue to do things that are a little bit atypical from sort of the historical perspective? What are the things you're looking for? What are the things you're trying to focus on to make sure you're competitive in that market? And how are the conversations go with the manufacturers? Obviously, it's a little bit of a slippery slope for them in terms of seeding too much price versus what the trade-off is for volume. George S. Barrett: Right, that's a really good question and probably deserves a very long answer, but I'll try to give it a summarized perspective. Obviously, a lot is happening, we all know that. Much of that, by the way, it's still relatively early stage, so it's so hard to discern exactly the implications of all that. Here's what I'd say about what's happening for us. Our sourcing program have just simply gotten better every year. We have a deeper team, we've got greater capabilities, including really global knowhow. We work with our manufacturer partners really closely. I would say, if I had to describe one of the changes that's most notable for me, is the level of strategic dialogue and discourse that we have with those manufacturers. And I think we do a really effective job coordinating our sort of upstream and downstream. I think we do a much better job on connecting the sourcing to our go-to-market model. So I think there's a lot happening. Our teams deserve a lot of credit. They execute really well. And we've gotten bigger. And I think that has helped, there's a bit of a virtuous cycle that occurs. But it's not about 1 dimension. It's not -- obvious, scale matters. Strategic relationships matter. Awareness of the strength of any given company in any given product area matters. And understanding how to deal with a market that has occasional disruptions matters. And so I think we've just done a good job of improving every aspect of the way we think about sourcing, both tactically and strategically. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just really had a couple of questions on the med-surg side of your business. Clearly, you talked about preferred items, continuing to see increases there. What are your expectations over the next year or so? And then secondly, any expectations at all as we move into the Affordable Care Act and increasing utilization on that side of your business in your relationships with the hospitals? George S. Barrett: So let me start with preferred products. I think in a broader sense, we are seeing increasing attention in the provider space among hospitals and the integrated systems on what they call physician preference items. And I think they recognize that this is an area where efficiency needs to carry the day and that is not historically been the case. This is an area that we're very focused on. We've done really well in growing this space. I would expect that to continue to grow for us. A lot of our preferred products fall into this category. And as you know, we've done some things to sort of take a step forward in the system. So for example, again, our partnership with EMERGE, which is really in the orthopedic trauma area, while it's early, we're seeing real enthusiasm and a lot of demand from our customers on this. And so we'll continue to roll out that program and I would expect that we'll add additional categories going into the future. So I expect preferred products to be a driver for us. On the broader question of our customers, it's really a unique time, as you know. There's a huge amount of change, a lot of experimentation in the market in terms of trying new models. And for us, I think our ability to touch all parts of this system matters here because I think we can gain insights from being able to connect all the players in the system and start thinking about their solutions from a broader perspective. It's no longer just simply how do you drop a basis point out of your medical, surgical distribution. It's how do you create solutions that allow them to change the game a little bit because I think more than we're thinking about more significant changes than just focusing on an individual price, it's not going to get there alone. So we -- I think we've done a good job with our sales organization of realigning around those strategic partners. And we're trying to be very creative, very open-minded. We don't do one-size-fits-all. And I hope they will see us as a company that you can go to with your basic convection problems and we have some solutions that we can bring. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And George, when we think about that in the context, of margin and maybe this is a question for Jeff, if I remember historically, your private label Allegiance product has a much better margin. And so as we think about these preferred products, is this a nice margin-enhancing opportunity over the next couple of years? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Lisa, it's Jeff. Absolutely. I mean, virtually everything we're doing in the medical space these days is geared towards margin expansion, whether it'd be our entry into the Home Health or our focus on providing additional services to our hospital customers or expanding in the surgery centers, in physicians' office space and definitely, preferred products are very much in the forefront of that as well. We've said previously that right now, with the inclusion of AssuraMed in the overall portfolio, our preferred products make up about 20% of the revenue in the medical segment. From a gross profit standpoint, that's closer to the mid-30s. So just from that, you get a pretty good idea of how much higher margin the preferred products are. Clearly, there's opportunities to continue to expand that portfolio very aggressively and it will enable us to drive up the Medical segment profit margin over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan of Sterne Agee. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : So as you think about your portfolio over the next several years, how would you characterize the concentration of limited stores generics relative to total brand generic conversion? I know it's a difficult one to predict, but just any directional comments will be very, very much helpful. George S. Barrett: Greg, it's George. I wish I could give you a great answer on that. I mean, I think that we will have and continue to have certain products that have, on the generic side, characteristics that probably bring fewer number of competitors. Now that could be a statutory exclusivity. It could be a court case, as one we just saw in a complex drug. I do think that we see some of the more complex drug posing greater challenges for the manufacturers. And so there are those that will have the capabilities to do those things and those who are probably working a little bit lower in the spectrum of complexity. So I would say, we'll continue to have a mix of products in our 4,000 generics. You're probably always going to have 3,500 plus that feel more typically commoditized and then a smaller set, whether that's 100 or 200, that have unique characteristics. I would -- I don't see why -- catalysts for some change there. I think the characteristics that we're seeing are -- have been seeing for a while are ones that we see at least into the near term. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : That's great. And then just last question, as you think about your medical-surgical portfolio, we've talked about in the past kind of moving up as it relates to just the, I guess, the ASP, the sophistication of technology or medical equipment that you're offering on a preferred basis. But any updates that possibly you could give us as it relates to the partnerships you're thinking about, maybe with an x U.S. manufacturer, one may be coming to North America or potentially acquiring IPs or the development capabilities? Any commentary there would be very helpful. George S. Barrett: Yes, probably only general commentary, although really good questions. We're very, very much focused in building our preferred product program, and we recognize that there are categories that probably have a lot of very mature products, and those are places where you'd naturally see some opportunities. You can imagine that we are exploring many. We'll probably provide a little more color on this in December when we get together. But you should assume that we think about this quite broadly rather than a single product line. We recognize that there are opportunities. And opportunities to work collaboratively with some well-known companies. So we're sort of open-minded about hedges, but you should assume that we have a wide screen here not an incredibly narrow one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I apologize if you guys got into this. I've been jumping around some calls this morning. But on the guidance raise, I just wanted to confirm, Jeff, that's all operational? I guess, said another way, the assumption is that the tax rate goes up considerably for the balance of the year, is that right? Jeffrey W. Henderson: That's absolutely correct, Bob. We have not changed our full year tax rate assumption one bit. There will be some volatility in the quarters. Like we saw in Q1, we had a significant positive benefit, we are expecting to see some significant negative benefit potentially later on in the year, so it'll average out over the course of the year. But our assumptions in that regard have not changed one bit. So the raising guidance was 100% related to operating performance. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then just one on generic pricing. It looks like you guys noted flat generic pricing in the quarter. We've seen similar anecdote across the industry. I guess, what's your view, George, on what's driving this? And then maybe if you could just help us understand how you're thinking about generic pricing going forward, what's reflected in the current guidance, that would be helpful. George S. Barrett: Yes, thanks, Bob. Again, you've heard me say this before so I apologize if it sounds like a broken record. Modeling this going forward is, as you know, really difficult. But Jeff did mention that, I guess, we characterize sort of moderating deflation and in some specific generics, inflation. Again, we're talking in general on those about sort of smaller subset of products rather than the broader portfolio. But nonetheless, it can have an impact. I think in terms of market conditions, it's driven by a number of things. Certainly, there's consolidation in the industry. There've been some real supply challenges, as you know, heightened inspection intensity, a number of things that have given some, let's say, disturbances to the market or have caused some companies to focus more specifically on a group of products and essentially not others. So I think those characteristics have -- which we see today are the ones that probably we've been seeing for the last at least 6 months. And so it's probably a number of things contributing to this environment, but that's basically what I would see. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I have a quick question on the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. So backing out Express and Walgreens, then you get to about 14% organic growth rate for the segment. Can you give us some color when we think about the Pharmaceutical margin improvement in the quarter? If you can help us quantify or understand what percent of it was really driven by the transition of the lower-margin business versus organic. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Ricky, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. First of all, let's be clear, Express Scripts contract did have a negative profit impact year-on-year for the quarter. The Walgreens contract actually did not have a material profit impact and that was really due to the nature of the unwind and how various things happened as we were going through the transition. To answer your question about margin rates, I would say there were 3 major contributors to the 29 basis points or so that we saw for the quarter. The biggest was the overall performance of our generics portfolio. And then the other 2 were the disappearance of the Express Scripts numbers in this year's quarter and the wind down of the Walgreens contract. Those were the 3 very significant drivers for the quarter, but the biggest was our generics programs. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And when you think about kind of like the organic growth, should we assume that those rates will continue for the remainder of the year? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I'm not going to give you specific guidance on the margin, Ricky. But I would expect that our margin rates year-on-year will continue to show improvement for the course of the year due to the customer mix, again, obviously, we don't have Walgreens anymore going forward, but also just because of the continued performance of the overall business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of FBR. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : I had 2 questions. The first one was just in the med-surg business. Can you sort of frame the growth that you saw x AssuraMed? And are you seeing any inflection points in utilization in the marketplace that you can perceive? George S. Barrett: Why don't I start on utilization and then we'll sort of talk generally about how we're doing. I would still describe the overall utilization environment as relatively soft. I probably would not be able to say there's been a deterioration since our last call, nor would I say there's a discernible uplift. But I would say still relatively soft. An exception, however, would be in the home health space. I do think that just the forces of the market are going to increase demand in the home. And we see that and we're continuing to observe a line around those changes. But we are seeing some really good performance generally. And Don Casey and his team had done a great job of thinking about the changes in the market and seeing some progress in a number of areas of the business. Aside of AssuraMed, part of it has to do with, again, delivery of services at the right time in the right place to the right sets of customers. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add to this. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, I think the most significant change we saw in this quarter was really the growth in our strategic accounts. And these are generally the larger organic IDN accounts that have considerable networks, including both hospitals, surgery centers and physicians offices. And they've been a focus of considerable attention from us over the past while, in particular, because we're the only player that can fully service the needs of those entire strategic account networks. And we really saw that pay off are in Q1. Those accounts were up 8% on the top line, which is really, I think, a validation of our efforts. And I think what's also important about it is that growth is being driven by very often them choosing to increase their preferred product portfolio, to increase the services that they're buying from us, et cetera. Because they're really seeing opportunities by increasing their portfolio purchases from us to increase the efficiency of their supply chain network. So I would say that was probably the most significant change that we saw in Q1. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : And then just a follow-up, George, I appreciate your comments sort of about the landscape and the evolving world that we're in. You talked a little bit about your perspective vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturer. Can you tell us anything about the conversations or the questions you're being asked from customers in light of what your competitors are doing out there? George S. Barrett: From customers or from our manufacturer partners? Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : No, no. You certainly talked a little bit about manufacturer before, so I was really thinking about retailers, et cetera, what they're thinking or saying to you? George S. Barrett: Yes, as it relates to our broad base of customers, I would still say that a lot of the things that all of us are talking about here on this call are not generally their day-to-day worry. Their day-to-day worry is competing in a unique time with some formidable competitors, with challenging reimbursement rates and all the dynamics around how they compete in their communities. I would say that, that's primarily the conversations that we have with them, is about how do we help them compete and do their work rather than a lot of conversation about what's happening upstream. I would say, it's not typically -- obviously, they're aware of it, but it's still early to even -- for them, to even discern how that may or may not impact them. And so I think, right now, they're really focused on day-to-day competition, how do they do it and how do we help them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : It's Steve Valiquette. So I'm also trying to juggle 3 calls at once, so I'm not sure I've quite mastered that skill yet. But just a couple of things from the press release, you mentioned that both generic and branded programs showed strong performance. Would you characterize it further that maybe one of those was a bigger contributor than the other? There's been a lot of talk around generic inflation tailwinds. I'm wondering if that was maybe a bigger part versus branded? Yes, sorry, go ahead. Jeffrey W. Henderson: That wasn't us that was cutting you off, sorry, Steve. But I will answer your question and then you can continue if you'd like. For the quarter, generics programs were a bigger contributor than branded programs, but I would describe both of their contributions as meaningful for the quarter. But we were pleased with the entire product portfolio. By the way, we're also pleased with the progress in nuclear and specialty as well, which really together as a group, made up the pharma results. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then I don't want to ask a redundant question, but did anybody ask about the revenue upside in the quarter? It was pretty meaningful versus consensus and I'm just trying to get a sense for whether that was maybe just some over time from maybe Walgreens on the roll off of that, or just other factors maybe just strength within the existing customer base, or just as generic erosion is not quite as severe now that we're anniversary-ing the big wave from 2012, is that part of it as well? Jeffrey W. Henderson: That's a good question, Steve. First of all, it wasn't because of Walgreens. Actually, the Walgreens revenue transition happened exactly as expected. And as I mentioned, it actually was worth the $1.7 billion of decrease year-on-year for the quarter. I would say the other factors you mentioned though were all drivers. First of all, we did pick up some incremental business with existing customers, as well as some new business. We saw good volume growth organically with our existing customers. We did see a little bit stronger brand inflation than we had budgeted for. And as I said, just generic deflation was probably a little bit more moderate than we expected as well. And then on top of that, specialty had a nice pick up in Q1 as well from a revenue standpoint. So I'd say all those were contributors to an above-expectation performance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just a clarification regarding the EPS range for the remainder of the year. I know, Jeff, you said that guidance excludes tax benefit. But can you just clarify that, that applies to $2.70 to $2.80 for the remainder of the year? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Just to be clear, the guidance does include the $0.18 tax benefit in Q1, but it also includes an expectation that, that will largely be offset later in the year by negative tax adjustments. So net-net, all the tax is in there, but when you net them all against each other, they end up back at where we expected the tax range to be for the year, which is 34.5% to 36%. Well, my comment was that the change in the guidance range going from $3.45 to $3.60 to $3.62 to $3.72 was in no way linked to any changes in our assumptions about taxes. Really, the tax situation this year is really just a matter of timing in the quarters. Our basic expectation for taxes has not change at all. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So can you just help me through it, because I'm a little bit slow on that. What does that imply for the remainder of the year? Because I get 2 ranges, either $2.70 to $2.80 or $2.52 to $2.62. Jeffrey W. Henderson: The range you should be assuming including taxes $3.62 to $3.72. What that implies, though, is that in a future quarter, we would likely have a significant negative tax impact which will offset the positive that we saw in Q1 and so those largely net against each other. But the $3.62 to $3.72 is the right range. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : George, I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary you made with respect to generic pricing. Kind of sounds like you've been talking about more moderating deflation rates now for a couple, few quarters. I'm kind of curious to see if you're willing to call that a trend at this point. And then this quarter, it seems like a couple of you have called out certain supply disruptions and I'm kind of curious as to what's been driving the margin more. Is it the supply disruptions or is it the moderating rate of deflation? George S. Barrett: Well, it's a hard one to answer. Let me try, Glen. I think the pattern that we've seen, we have seen now for quite some time, deflation on the bulk of products, on the bulk of products, largely as expected. On a few products that we modeled, the deflation was lower. And then on a few products, we actually saw some inflation. So that is -- those are sort of the big moving pieces. There are thousands of pieces in that equation, but I think that is the pattern that we've seen. And I'm not sure it's changed dramatically. And again, the question is, when you say trend, like would I model it going forward in the future, I would say right now, there's nothing in the market we're seeing that's going to change that, basic competition is as it is. We will very carefully watch every court case to see whether or not that -- we had one recently -- affect the number of competitors in a given product. But it has been a pattern that we've seen for some time. So as we talk about disruption, I really put that in the context more of whether or not there is some sets of products where competition seems more limited. And I think what can happen when you have some supply disruptions is the market that maybe had 6 or 7 players now has 3 or 4, or 2 or 3. And that may have a tendency to stabilize prices in that set of products. And I think we have seen some of that over the last couple of years. You've seen some well-publicized cases of some companies going through some facility issues. FDA, as you know, has done more for foreign inspection in recent years. And so I think that is a part of our current environment. And I expect that to continue. And so that's partly what we're seeing. How to tell you exactly how much is attributable to a disruption versus just sort of competitive behavior would be really hard to discern. I just think it's part of the general environment that we're seeing. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. I know you don't want to comment on calendar '14 and '15, but as you look at the patent expiration schedule over those -- over the next 24 months, we on The Street all have the tendency to want to look at the dollar value of brand going generic. Do one of those 2 years look bigger to you, or bigger opportunity for you versus the other, or they both look good, or neither as good as what we saw in the past couple of years? How would you characterize it? George S. Barrett: Yes, so it's really early. I'm sorry, can't give you a full answer on this one. It's -- we just started our '14, it's hard to characterize '15. I think if we go back to the beginning of our year, we talked about the pattern, we probably saw '15 not altogether different than '14, but that was really in our fiscal year. It will be hard for me sort of off the top of my head to sort of give you a quick answer and probably would be a little bit hesitant to do so at this stage anyway. It's very early. But I would remind you of this and I think maybe our current performance highlights that. Jeff mentioned that our contribution from new products was actually less in this period and yet we had a very strong generic performance. So I guess, I'd remind you that while generic launches influence our performance, there are a lot of other things that actually contribute to how we generate growth and profits under our generic program. And we've been able to do that even in the face of what, I guess, you would call a headwind on new launch values. So that's just sort of a reminder. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : George, you mentioned specialty as a contributor. Was most of that coming from oncology, or are you seeing nice growth in the other therapeutic classes as well? George S. Barrett: Yes, John, I think we're seeing growth everywhere, but oncology was probably the biggest driver in this particular period. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. Great. And then a follow-up on medical, if you're willing. Could you give us a sense of how your operating income across medical breaks down into some of your key client categories? I'm thinking home care, now that you have AssuraMed, versus institutional versus perhaps ambulatory? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I'm not going to give you specifics, John, because we don't break it down that way publicly. I would still say our hospital and hospital-related business is the largest chunk of both revenue and earnings, followed by Home Health now with the addition of AssuraMed, followed by sort of pure ambulatory physicians offices, et cetera, that are unrelated to large IDN. That's sort of the rough order. Obviously, the biggest change there has been the big step up in Home Health over the last couple of months with the inclusion of AssuraMed. George S. Barrett: I think I'll probably add that the rates don't necessarily follow that pattern. So the rates would probably be higher in the more ambulatory settings where the cost to serve and the requirements, how you do that, the pick/pack operations and everything else is quite different. So I would say the rates are probably -- I'm not sure, they're completely inverted but more on the home ambulatory as you move back towards the big items. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom of Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Sorry if I missed this, but could you, Jeff, could you help us understand the next 3 quarter effect of not having Walgreens in your numbers from an EPS standpoint? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Probably not, is the honest answer. I'm always a little bit low to give directly attributable to a customer and I'm sure Walgreens wouldn't appreciate that either. But I will say, it's probably a repeat of what I said earlier, Q1, there was very little, if any, earnings impact, just given the nature of the wind down, despite the fact that revenue was down $1.7 billion. That will not be the case for the next 3 quarters of this year or the first quarter of next year until we lap it. There will be a meaningful both revenue and earnings impact, but all that impact has been reflected in our guidance from day 1 and continues to be reflected in our guidance. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : That was a math question. You gave me an essay. Jeffrey W. Henderson: I was a lit major. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : English major, obviously. Okay. And then George, I know you touched on this, but just to kind of reset, obviously, your 2 competitors have done large deals overseas, trying to move toward global sourcing. You obviously ran a big generics supplier. Is there a card for you to play here potentially, or did you just not see the need for it? And what do you think the -- is there an opportunity cost in not pursuing what your competitors have been doing? George S. Barrett: Yes, so as I'm going to give you, of course, an answer. You're going to hate it because it's going to be quite general, but I think we'll have to go with that. Which is, right now, we're competing very effectively and I like where we are. You can imagine that we're not sitting still. We have a pretty broad-based knowledge base of what's happening in markets around the world. There's very little that we don't explore. So as I mentioned, I think we are well positioned, but we are going to stay very open-minded about new ways to create value and -- but that has to be real value for customers and our suppliers and, obviously, for our shareholders. So we'll -- I guess, what I would say is, I think there are chess pieces always available and we'll keep our hands on those chess pieces. But we'll deploy capital with an open mind, but I'd say, with sort of a disciplined hand, always conscious of making sure that we're in the most competitive position. I know it's a very broad answer, but that's the best I can do for now. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's fine. And then shifting into a little more of a micro topic. How far -- if you look, say, 5 years out in the U.S. and think about cost containment pressures intensifying, how far off the value curve do you think, let's say, off-brand devices could get to? I mean, could we start talking about the equivalent of generic knees and hips and things like that, or do you think there's a limit to what can be done there? George S. Barrett: Yes, so I'm not going to give you a specific answer, but I think it is reasonable to assume that we might view that we need both innovative medical devices, which continue to be developed. And I think actually some of the pressures will to be -- to develop more of them. But I think on mature products that we do need, given the cost containment pressures, some way of bringing greater competition to those products, we are on that issue. We understand that. I think your question is right on the mark. And it's not certainly complete analog to what we see in generics where you have sort of a mechanism that we call an AB rating that creates the go-to-market model. But I do think there are ways to do this, but it requires, I think, unique sets of skills. Those are clinical skills that we're building, that requires a go-to-market strategy. And you need to be doing it based on data and not just on a wish. And so we're doing all those things to put ourselves in a position to help support a system that probably needs some ways to reduce costs on some of these older, more mature products. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : George, I see Teva's looking for a new CEO. You're not getting antsy on us, are you? George S. Barrett: I had a very public comment yesterday explaining that I was not a candidate. As you know, I've got great admiration for all that they do and had great experience there. I'm having a great time leading Cardinal Health and very committed to seeing our continued progress. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : All right. Well, that really wasn't a trick, that really wasn't a trick. But the quarter was a treat, good job. 3 questions on specialty. I'll make it 1 question wrapped into 3 subparts. First off, I missed the growth rates. Second of all, can you give us a sense on where the oncology growth share is coming from and what's the nature of that business, community, hospital, other? And then third part, if distribution growth is accelerating more than services growth around specialty, does that lead to margin compression in the group or are you getting scale efficiencies that can allow overall specialty profitability to improve? George S. Barrett: Let's start with Jeff. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Eric, it's Jeff. Let me start. We didn't give the number for specialty, but I'll give it to you now. Our Specialty Solutions group grew revenue 41% in Q1. George, do you want to take it from there? George S. Barrett: Yes, I would say, primarily, it's coming in the community setting for now. Here's what I'd say. I think we're getting additional scale in distribution which gives us additional positioning and just sort of credibility in the offices. I do think that the services that wrap around this work is always critical. I think many of us can do distribution and I think we certainly established ourselves as a very credible and now a scale-based player in the distribution side. But I think it's very important to be able to deliver the kind of services that can help them in a very different world. And that's where things like our PathWare tools and other tools that help sort of connect these 3 players with the patients. Obviously, the 3 players being the biopharma company, the provider and the payor. But I think the wraparound services are very important for us. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And generically, on the margin profile, faster growth in distribution, does that weigh on the profile, or are you getting scale efficiencies there? George S. Barrett: I think we expected our growth on the distribution side to be heavier. It's the nature of it. Obviously, distribution margin's relative, certain kinds of service margins are lower. But it's not negatively affecting our projection and how we expected this growth to occur. This is sort of as we saw it, we're pleased to see the growth on the revenue side, because it just means we're getting more presence. All right. Listen, I think we're going to wrap up the call. So first, those of you who know, Sally is a rabid Red Sox fan. So we've been just trying to keep her on the ground today, she's a little excited. I'll just conclude by saying, it's been an excellent, excellent start, I think, to fiscal '14. And we really look forward to seeing all of you. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing you in December and thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett: Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone. We had a very strong second quarter operating performance, closing out an excellent first half to our fiscal 2014, so let's get started. Total revenues for the second quarter were approximately $22 billion. The decline was 12%, as our revenue line no longer included any sales from the Walgreens supply agreement. Net of this, we experienced growth with existing customers and contribution from the business. We achieved a very solid increase in our non-GAAP operating earnings. In a quarter where we felt the full impact of no longer serving Walgreens, we were able to achieve a 10% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings. Our gross margin rate expanded by 120 basis points to 6% in the quarter from 4.8% last year, and our gross margin dollars increased by 10%. I will note here that we achieved strong margin expansion and operating profit increases in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments. Our second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.90, down from $0.93 last year. This decline, however, includes a charge of $0.16 per share related to a tax reserve. We had mentioned this on our first quarter call and said that it could occur as early as second quarter. As you may recall, our first quarter EPS had an $0.18 benefit from the resolution of some historical tax matter. Note that for the first half of our fiscal 2014, non-GAAP EPS stands at $2.00, an increase of 15% versus last year after the puts and takes of those discrete tax adjustments. So based on our year-to-date result and the strength of our operating performance, we are now raising our guidance to a new range of $3.75 to $3.85 for fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS. Before we talk about the segments in more detail, let me take just a few minutes to discuss our joint venture with CVS Caremark, which we announced in December. You may remember that during our last earnings conference call, I talked about some of the changes in our marketplace and noted that we had been evaluating and would continue to evaluate all options to sustain and expand our competitive advantage and to deliver meaningful and lasting values for our customers and our supplier partners and our shareholder. We believe that the CVS Caremark joint venture accomplishes those objectives. We created a purchasing combination of tremendous scale, which we know is critical in generic. It allows us to bring together 2 of the most knowledgeable and experienced generic-sourcing teams in the world. The 50-50 venture is structurally straightforward. We're not changing the service model or our operating platform. The venture is focused solely on global sourcing for the U.S. market. It allows our 2 companies to pursue our independent strategies to serve our own distinct customers as we see fit, and we will accomplish this while maintaining the capital flexibility to continue to invest in other growth and high-return alternatives. We believe there will be opportunities to work strategically and collaboratively with our generic manufacturer partners to explore new ways to create value. Finally, as we announced in December, our teams are hard at work with the goal of being operational as early as July. Now, onto the segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered solid profit growth of 9% on a revenue decline of 15%. We were pleased to see this strong volume growth from new and existing customers. Our segment margin expanded by 54 basis points, driven by the strength of both generic and branded programs and by the product and customer mix initiatives that have been an important part of our strategy for the past few years. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our presence in retail pharmacy. Of course, we were very excited to announce the extension of the CVS service agreement for an additional 3 years through June of 2019. We remain deeply committed to retail pharmacy. Whether that is delivered through a chain drug, a food and drug retailer or one of our thousands of independent pharmacy customers, we believe that pharmacy must and will play a more vital role in the delivery of health care. With this in mind, we will continue to deliver best-in-class products and services to ensure that our pharmacy customers can serve this valuable role in an evolving health care system. Our Specialty Solutions team continues to deliver robust growth, validating our perspective that working at the intersection of the provider, biopharmaceutical manufacturer and payer will be important for the future. Over these past 3 years, it has been important for us to build scale in specialty distribution in order to enable greater touch points with clinicians. Now that we've achieved critical mass and through building out more services, operational and clinical, to serve these providers, we are beginning to realize some of the benefits. At the same time, our Specialty Solutions team has been gaining momentum with our biopharmaceutical partner. We are increasingly able to offer the innovative clinical capabilities these manufacturers require to serve patients who often have distinct needs and, at the same time, navigate a complex reimbursement environment. And we've created the teams and made the moves to build a best-in-class, patient-centric hub, serving the needs of patients and reinforcing the work of our manufacturer partners. Finally, on Specialty, we're seeing an increasing interest among payers who want to see better alignment in the system to improve cost-effectiveness. Our Medical segment performance was strong. Revenue was up 13% to $2.8 billion, and segment profit increased 40%. The largest contributor to that growth came from our AssuraMed acquisition, the centerpiece of our strategy to serve patients in the home. Although acute-care utilization remains somewhat soft, we experienced growth in our existing customer base and increased penetration in our targeted strategic accounts [ph]. Our ability to provide new service offerings is extremely important, as our customers take on new configurations and experience different economic and regulatory forces. Building our preferred products portfolio remains a top priority and a high priority for our customer. Our ability to grow here addresses an important pain point for our customers, hospitals and ambulatory, and we are committed to providing a comprehensive solution set, and this goes beyond the products and includes services and analytics. Customer response has been strong, and we will continue to add to our growing portfolio of clinical alternatives to mature medical devices. Our medical consumables line continues to gain solid traction. Our product launch rate in the first 6 months of fiscal 2014 was considerably higher than we've ever had. We're moving quickly to add high-quality, high-value options for the customer. Looking forward, we believe we can increase our medical consumable penetration in nontraditional medical channels, such as home health and long-term care. As we look to home health, AssuraMed reported a very solid quarter, again, outperforming our ideal [ph] model. We remain very committed to following the patient to the home. The demographics are inescapable and the cost-effectiveness of keeping patients well cared for in the home is hard to dispute. To help support our strategy of serving patients in the home, during this past quarter, we made 2 tuck-in acquisitions in the urology, incontinence and ostomy care area, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to draw on the strength of this platform. Turning to China. We had another quarter of very strong growth on both the revenue and profit line. The sales run rate for this business is now approximately $2.5 billion, and we feel very optimistic about its growth. China is a unique market going through a very rapid evolution. We continue to play out our strategy here of enlarging our geographic footprint, creating new business partnership and bringing our expertise to new opportunities such as direct-to-patient. We finished the quarter with 28 direct-to-patient or DTP specialty pharmacies, as we move toward our goal of at least 50 across the country, an example of an innovative health care solution to delivering high-cost specialty drug to the patient's hand. We also completed the acquisition of a specialty retail pharmacy company during the quarter that, combined with our existing retail pharmacies, gives us national coverage and e-commerce capabilities. We will continue to expand this chronic care work with a focus on very disease-centric patient support models. Let me conclude by saying that this is a period of extraordinary change for health care and for Cardinal Health. It's uncommon to experience a moment like this, a moment which requires those of us who have the privilege and the responsibility of being in health care, to demonstrate our ability to innovate and to evolve in a way which can move us toward a system which is higher quality and more cost-effective. I thank our people for demonstrating the readiness to step up to that challenge and for their fine performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, George, and hello, everyone. This morning, I'll be reviewing the drivers of second quarter performance and will provide additional detail on the full year, including our decision to raise our fiscal '14 guidance range. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported a 10% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings in our fiscal '14 second quarter versus the prior-year period, driven by margin expansion across both of our reporting segments. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 outperformed our expectations, but were slightly down compared to the prior-year period. This decline was driven by an anticipated discrete tax charge of $56 million based on proposed assessments of additional tax. This unusual $0.16 per share unfavorable impact was triggered in Q2 and mostly offset the favorable tax settlement gain of $0.18 per share in Q1 of this year. Including this unfavorable impact, Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share grew a robust 14%, a great quarter of growth. Again, to be clear, both the Q1 positive $0.18 tax benefit and this Q2 $0.16 tax charge essentially offset each other and both have been contemplated in our guidance since the beginning of the year. We mentioned this in our Q1 call. I'll now go through the rest of the income statement in a little bit more detail, starting with revenue. Consolidated sales were down 12% to $22.2 billion, which was better than we expected. The decline was due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract, which was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Gross margin dollars increased 10% to 6% of revenue, with the rate up a strong 120 basis points versus prior year. This continues our 3.5-year trend of margin expansion. SG&A expenses rose 10% in Q2, primarily driven by acquisitions, including AssuraMed, as well as increase in incremental incentive compensation accruals related to the company's over-performance. Our core SG&A was essentially flat year-over-year, evidence of our enterprise-wide commitment to controlling costs and improving the efficiency of our operations while continuing to invest in our key strategic priority. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 52 basis points to 2.6%. We have now posted operating margins greater than 2% in 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are making progress towards our longer-term aspiration of consolidated non-GAAP operating margin greater than 3%. You'll notice that our net interest and other expense came in $4 million higher in Q2 than in the prior year's quarter. This was mostly due to the new $1.3 billion of debt we issued in February of last year associated with the AssuraMed acquisition. Non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 43.3% versus the prior year's 36.8%. This unusually higher rate was primarily driven by the discrete $56 million tax charge I mentioned earlier. Please note that this amount only affects our tax line and has no impact on operating earnings or the segment results. As I had mentioned previously, we anticipate both a positive tax impact in the first quarter and the Q2 unfavorable impact when we originally provided our FY '14 tax guidance range. I'll speak about update in that range in a moment. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 346.2 million for the second quarter, which is about 3 million shares higher than last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we repurchased $50 million worth of shares, all in Q1. And at the end of December, we had $1.35 billion remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. We'll update you on share count assumptions for the full year later in my prepared remarks. Now, let's discuss the consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. We generated approximately $40 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of almost $1 billion is about where we expect to be given the unwinding of the Walgreens contract. Of note, the net working capital component from that unwind is essentially complete. And as a reminder, there typically is a large degree of operating cash flow variability in sequential quarters. Moving on, at the end of Q2, we had $2.7 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes $446 million held internationally. Our working capital days decreased versus prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first. Pharma segment revenue came in better than we expected. However, it did post a decrease of almost 15% versus the prior year period to $19.4 billion. This is the first period where we reported a full quarter of revenue loss in Walgreens, which amounts to just over $5 billion. This was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Pharma segment profit increased by 9% to $482 million, driven by strong performance from both of our generic programs and branded agreement, including the impact of price inflation. This was partially offset by the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Unlike our first quarter, this quarter reflects the full operating earnings impact of this expiration. I'll also note that each of our Pharma segment businesses had strong profit growth compared to the prior-year period. With respect to generics, sales and profits from our generics programs exhibited very good year-over-year growth in the quarter. This is a result of the emphasis we have placed on building the strength of our programs over the last several years, the overall robustness of the market and the effect of price inflation. I'll also note that as anticipated, we did see less contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus the prior-year period. For the second quarter in a row, the generic deflation rate was essentially flat year-on-year. I do want to note that our generic performance this year has included what we believe to be abnormally high inflation on a relatively small basket of products. Because generic pharmaceutical pricing is still difficult to predict, we remain relatively conservative in our forecasting for this segment. In addition, we saw strong performance under our branded pharma contract, with brand inflation in the low-double digit, which was slightly better than we expected. We also saw a few branded price increases that occurred late in our second quarter, which we had modeled to occur during our Q3. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 54 basis points compared to the prior year's Q2. And moving onto Medical segment performance. Medical revenue growth was up 13% versus last year. Home health, reflecting our AssuraMed acquisition, was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. As a reminder, we will lap this acquisition in our third quarter. And given that it's becoming increasingly integrated into our operation, we will not call it out separately starting in Q4. We also saw volume growth from our existing customer base, as we continue to focus on strategic hospital network accounts, which tend to utilize more of our products and services to drive efficiency in their supply chain. Our strategic accounts grew 7% for the period. Medical segment profit grew a robust 40% in Q2, primarily driven by the performance of our home health platform, AssuraMed. As George said, the AssuraMed integration has done very well, and we are on-track to achieve our original estimate of at least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. Other factors positively impacting segment profit included contribution from planned efficiency initiatives and preferred product. Partially offsetting the Medical segment profit growth was a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation, much of which is based on total company performance and allocated to the segment. Now a quick note on Cardinal Health China, a business which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China, again, posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 37%, and we saw solid margin expansion. Let me pause for a moment to comment on the overall pharma market in China, which has been experiencing some turbulence recently. Based on external estimates, it appears that the market was growing at a rate in the mid- to high-teens in the first half of calendar 2013. Due largely to the impact of some government regulatory actions to improve the integrity of the system, the growth rate dropped to high-single digits in the second half of calendar '13. However, we are starting to see some signs of recovery and forecasts point to a return to mid-teens growth in calendar '14. Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduced our GAAP results by $0.11 per share compared to non-GAAP. Included is $0.10 of amortization and acquisition-related costs. Also included in this figure are $0.02 for restructuring and employee severance and $0.02 of impairment on loss on disposals of assets. In Q2 of last year, GAAP results were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily related to amortization and other acquisition-related costs. Now, I'll talk briefly about guidance for the current fiscal year. Given the strong operating performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the next 6 months, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS range to $3.75 to $3.85. We are also updating a few of our underlying corporate assumptions. First, we are increasing our anticipated diluted weighted average shares outstanding to a range of 345 million to 347 million for the year. A few reasons for this. We are forecasting a fair amount of option dilution in the second half of the fiscal year. Also, we are limited in how often we can go to market to buy back shares during the first half of the year. We still plan of repurchasing shares worth at least a couple hundred million dollars in the second half, with exact timing and amount to be determined based on the market and other factors. Given all this, we have incorporated a range of possible share count outcomes in our EPS guidance. Second, we are reducing our interest and other assumption, but widening the range to $105 million to $130 million due to a possible gain on an investment which may impact the second half of the fiscal year. Third, we had a slight increase in the expected amortization of intangible-related assets to approximately $184 million or about $0.34 per share, which captures a few small tuck-ins we completed in the quarter. Lastly, we are revising the full-year expected tax rate range to 35% to 36%. The large discrete items we anticipated for the year have now been booked in the first half. We do expect a higher tax rate in the second half of fiscal '14 compared to the first half. As we look to the second half, I wanted to point out a few other differences versus the first half of fiscal 2014. First, we had about a full quarter of earnings from Walgreens in Q1. Second, we believe that the amount and rate of generic inflation in the first half of the year was unusually high [indiscernible] with a more moderate impact in the second half. Third, recall that when we announced the CVS JV, we knew there would be some related costs during the second half of fiscal 2014. Finally, Q3 is typically our strongest quarter for brand inflation, and we expect that to happen again this year. However, we did see inflation on a few products in Q2 that we had modeled in Q3. That may skew our usual seasonal earnings pattern in Pharma somewhat. But most importantly, we continue to expect to build on the momentum of our strong business, and particularly our areas of strategic emphasis. In closing, I would like to thank the Cardinal Health team for a very strong first half. Their tenacity and execution against our strategic priorities continues to pay dividend. I'm looking forward to the second half of fiscal 2014. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, our first question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is Zack in for Ricky. I wanted to start by asking about generic inflation and your assumptions for the second half. There was news last week that Ranbaxy had an import ban on one of their plants, and just curious on your thoughts on how that might impact generic inflation and if that's considered in your more modest guidance for the second half? George S. Barrett: Yes, sure. Why don't I take it? I'll touch on, first, the general environment, and then -- and maybe a little bit more specific around Ranbaxy. So let's start with this. We've indicated and you've heard, and Jeff reiterated, that it's been a bit of an unusual stretch in pricing. We've seen price increases on a number of products, and the number is above what we have historically seen. But I'd remind you here that we carry thousands of generic products, and so when we look at this period, fewer than 5% of these products are experiencing meaningful price increases. So just again, recognize that it's a relatively small subset of the generic portfolio. It is difficult, and Jeff said this, to predict, as you look forward. I think just taking the appropriate assumption here that the recent months have been somewhat unusual and that this dynamic moderates going forward. As it relates to the Ranbaxy problems, again, this is a by-product of some work that we've seen with FDA. The FDA certainly increased its capacity to do inspections outside of the U.S. Clearly, for some companies, that has posed a challenge or a spill-in [ph] for the certain facilities. We, as you would imagine, are very careful to make sure that we stay on top of all the global supply dynamics and, in many cases, utilize multiple sources as a result. I would not say that the specific story around Ranbaxy will have any impact on our business as we look to the rest of the year and going forward. So it's -- they're a player in our mix, but one of many, and won't have any impact on us going into the rest of the year. Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And then just on CVS, just curious, as you've talked with current customers, what their early reaction has been now that it's been 6 weeks or so past the announcement. And if there's been any indication of more interest in purchasing generics from Cardinal due to this deal? George S. Barrett: Sure. So why don't -- again, it's George, I'll take this again. We've actually had great support from our customers. It's been a noisy stretch, as you know, in the last year. And I think given some of that noise in the market, in many ways, it's been reassuring to our customers that we'll always be in the best position to keep them competitive. And so I would say, generally, we've had great support. I would also add that I think making sure that our joint venture was really a 50-50 relationship really told our customers or other customers that no external party would be dictating or influencing our strategy to serve them. So I would say, thus far, we've had really good support from our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So I guess, the underlying results in Pharma continue to be better. It's hard to tease out all the components. It seems like, obviously, we talked about inflation. If you had to look at some of the other pieces that have most surprising to you, at least in the last maybe 3 or 6 months of development, obviously, China maybe is not one of them. But what parts would you say, in terms of how the team has executed, have been kind of the biggest standouts for you in terms of some of the said [ph] outperformance? George S. Barrett: Why don't I start and then maybe I'll turn it to Jeff. So here's -- you know that we have a pretty broad portfolio. We tend to because of size of certain of our business lines talk only about 1 or 2. It's very common that, that's what happens. But reality is we have a lot of business lines. And actually, what's been happening is many of them are going well. It's one of the nice things about having a portfolio, you have some [ph] of these puts and takes. We've been getting some pretty good performance across-the-board. And so I think that, that's really largely what's at work. So as we said, on our Medical business, while utilization has been sort of stopped, our focus on key strategic accounts and on key business lines, on mix has been really helpful to us. Our team's doing great job there. On our Pharmaceutical segment, we're getting growth in specialty. Obviously, we talked about generics and our work there. And so I think it's really sort of a balance issue, but maybe I'll let Jeff jump in and provide a little more color. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, I agree [ph]. As I said in my remarks, we really had good performance across-the-board in the Pharma segment. I mean, you briefly mentioned China, Ross. And, yes, we had a very good quarter in China. Now, we expected that. We expect very big things from our China operation, and albeit it's still a relatively small contributor to the overall profit of the corporation, we do expect strong growth there, and we very much got it [ph], in spite of the fact that the market was a little turbulent in the quarter. As George said, specialty posted good revenue and profit growth in the quarter. And we're really seeing our specialty team, they've really hit critical mass in terms of distribution size. They'll take advantage of that positioning to offer other services to manufacturers and providers and payers and that's beginning to drive the profit line for them. Interestingly, we saw better-than-expected results in Nuclear as well, and our team there is doing a really good job of responding to a very tough environment. And we've seen some -- a product, in particular, do quite well for that business. So we are seeing some good trends in Nuclear as well. Yes, it was a very encouraging quarter in many respects, that we really were hitting on all cylinders in most of the business within Pharma. Likewise, on the Med side, I highlighted a few things which were really important to us. One is the continued growth and impact of our home health platform and the fact that we tried to identify some external asset that we can bolt on to that, that are very accretive to us. So that was the great sign, in addition to the growth of the underlying business there. And the overall growth of that market, which is growing, looks like somewhere in the 6% to 8% range. And then finally, the 7% growth in strategic accounts is also very important. And these are accounts, by the way, that we've identified within our portfolio as being very large networks of hospitals and ambulatory sites that tend to buy a lot of our product and services because of the complex operations, and we can provide a host of services and products to them that can help them manage those networks. And seeing 7% growth in that portfolio was also very encouraging. So lots of good news to report for the quarter. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And maybe, you guys were able to kind of attack the whole generic sourcing question in a pretty capital-efficient manner, it leaves the balance sheet and your capital deployment capability in a pretty good place. I mean, as you see the tuck-in or midsized M&A environment today, how would you sort of characterize it versus where we were, I don't know, 3 or 6 months ago, just in terms of activity and the breadth of targets right now that are still out there for you to analyze? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I think it's a fairly attractive environment right now for the types of assets we're looking for. Particularly now that we've got a year, for example, of AssuraMed under our belt in terms of integrating that core platform into our business, our ability now, in turn, to find smaller tuck-ins that make sense to bolt-on to that platform, has increased. And as we've been looking for those assets, we're certainly pleased by what we've seen, including the 2 that we did in Q2. In China, we continue to do small tuck-ins. We completed 2 more in the second quarter, one which really gave us additional geographic expansion into a new region and the other was the one that George referenced that added to our specialty pharmacy network and gave us e-commerce capabilities. So we'll continue to pursue those types of acquisitions. I would say though, those tend to be relatively small acquisitions, but very important to building on our strategy in time. I'd say more broadly, we continue to see small to midsized assets that makes sense for the portfolio. And to the extent the price is right and the economics makes sense, we have the platforms to put them on, and we remain encouraged about those possibilities. Operator : We'll move now to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to go back to -- on the profit side on the Pharma business. It clearly feels like we're living in a pretty robust inflation environment on both the branded and generic side. I guess, just bigger picture, that trend would obviously seem counter to what we're seeing the push to be in overall health care today around savings. I guess, if maybe you guys separately, branded and generic, if you could talk a little bit about what do you think is driving this? Is it really more structural? Is it more circumstantial? And then, I guess, more importantly, how sustainable do you think it is in both of those areas? George S. Barrett: Bob, it's a really good question and a hard one to answer. This is George. I'll start. But let me just offer this as a starting point in Pharma, which is sort of maybe something we forget often. In the big picture, in the United States, our Pharma spend is the smallest part of our challenge, when all said and done. By the way, that doesn't mean any individual who's got a very expensive drug that they're -- they've been prescribed doesn't have challenges, but we're talking about a small percent of our overall spend. And actually, as you know, systemically, the growth of Pharmaceutical spend has actually been slowing. So I do think part -- as you know, part of that is sort of the level of generic penetration. So from a big picture standpoint, as a health system, actually our bigger challenges are really in our medical system than in Pharmaceuticals. Now having said that, we do think that there are periods that can be a little bit more unusual. This has been sort of on the generics side probably more noteworthy. It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen, but I do think it's always worth reminding ourselves that when we look at the Pharmaceutical segment, really, what you have is a huge number of products that are generic and highly generic, meaning penetration is extraordinarily high, and then a number of typically more specialty drugs that have unique characteristics. And I think that is a trend that we'll continue to see. And so I think, in a way, I think our model, we feel very strong about the model. We're extremely efficient. We work very well with our manufacturers. I think our fee-for-service kind of system is working and is working efficiently. And so, as I said, sort of in the big picture, I think you'd have to look at Pharmaceutical system as relatively efficient across-the-board. That doesn't mean that individual products wouldn't get some attention for their pricing, and we'll just have to continue to watch for them. But I think, in general, what we've done in our assumption is moderate our expectations as it relates to inflation just a little bit more to the historical norms and we thought that's the more cautious mode [ph]. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And I guess, just George, following up on the cash position, it doesn't seem like, again, there's a ton baked in on buybacks. It doesn't seem like that will a big source of deployment, at least relative to the current outlook. I mean, is there any more insight you can share with us on your priorities without, obviously, getting too specific? Are there things on the table right now that have kept you more cautious on getting more aggressive on the buyback? George S. Barrett: Yes, so I don't think for us it's a matter of cautious on buyback. I think we've always seen a capital deployment strategy that's very focused on returning long-term value to shareholders. So we've done that through investing in our core activities, in the dividend, in looking for acquisitions that strengthen our long-term competitive positioning, and buyback is as part of the equation. So that will still be the case. In terms of priorities, I'll let Jeff weigh in a little bit on it as well, as it relates to our priorities, again, we talked about strategic areas that we think are very important, and those are going to continue to be areas that we watch carefully. That doesn't mean there's always going to be the right acquisition opportunity there. But we've talked about generic, we've talked about specialty, we've talked about our home health and ambulatory platform, we've talked about medical consumables, we've talked about Preferred product, we've talked about China. So these are all areas for us that we believe are on the right side of where health care is going. We'll continue to invest in those. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything to it? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, just 2 other things, Bob. We remain very committed to a dividend. As you know, we view the dividend payout we have as being an important part of the story, in conjunction with our earnings story, and we're committed to maintaining and growing that dividend over time. And as I indicated at the Investor Day, our target is to remain in the 30% to 35% payout range for our dividend. With regards to repo, the fact that we've done relatively small amounts [indiscernible], as I mentioned $50 million in Q1, really, has nothing to do with a reticence to buy back more shares. It more had to do with timing in the first half of the year. Our inability, for a good chunk of the year, really, to enter the market because of some pending announcements, which have since been announced, by the way. Operator : The next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : George, I just want to ask you about the CVS JV. I mean, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're expecting that to sort of begin in earnest maybe on July 1. Could you kind of talk about it? If not much is changing with respect to how you buy generics today, like what has to happen over the next 6 months to prepare for that? Do you have to unwind certain generic manufacturing purchasing contracts? And if you could just elaborate on that a little bit more. And then maybe, Jeff, as we think about the fiscal '15 model, I know you don't want to comment on that today, but is it reasonable for us to start modeling the payment to CVS in fiscal '15 and maybe incorporating some cost of goods sold benefit within our fiscal '15 estimates? George S. Barrett: So, Glen, I'll take the beginning of your question, then I'll let Jeff jump in with the second part. So actually, it's a really good question because it's a reminder of how many moving parts there are in a product -- in our product line that are thousands of product families with many, many suppliers, different length agreements and different buying models. So it -- I can't go through all the individual details, but I think the answer, Glen, is there are a million of them. And actually, it's sort of the irony, as we talk about, this is a very straightforward design, which I think it is, taking out all the operational complexity, at least logistical complexity, but just simply aligning buying strategies, policies, procedures, existing contracts and commitments, is not a small piece of work. And so we have to do that in a very efficient way. It's already underway, and we feel good about that progress. But it is a lot of moving parts, and I'm really glad that we've got 2 talented teams that know what they're doing. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Glenn, it's Jeff. On the question about payment, at the risk of confusing a lot of people, let me try to explain how that's going to roll out because it's not -- the actual accounting for the payment is not as straightforward as the actual cash flow. So as you know, we are committed to a payment of $25 million a quarter to CVS starting with the beginning of the joint venture and continuing for a period of 10 years, and that's a fixed $25 million payment each quarter. However, the actual accounting for that payment is more of an amortization over time and reflects accrued interest, et cetera. So the actual amount you'll see, particularly in the early quarters, will be slightly higher than the $25 million payment and, really, that's because of the way the payment gets discounted and accrued interest grows out over time. The second point I'll say is that depending on when all the final documentation gets completed with CVS, if that happens this year, we'll actually start amortizing that payment as early as this year, and we expect that to begin as early as the beginning of Q4. Again, hopefully, I haven't confused everyone too much on that. With regards to your second question regarding benefit, we did say at our Investor Day that we expect the JV to be accretive to us in our fiscal '15. We continue to stand by that, which means that the benefits we would expect from the JV would more than offset the accounting of the payments next year. And as I said, the accounting of those payments next year will be slightly more than $25 million a quarter. So that gives you a rough idea, sort of our minimum expectations for the benefits next year. We also do expect that they will phase in over time. If the JV starts on July 1, we definitely wouldn't expect all the benefits to start on July 1. It'll take a good part of a year for us to really ramp up to what I would describe as the more full run rate. George S. Barrett: Let me just add again, with all the millions of moving parts we just described, we are really excited about this. I think we really know that the U.S. is the largest generic market in the world. It's a single market, it's got secured and known financing systems, incredibly important to manufacturers. And so I'm really excited about being able to put these 2 teams together to do work in this environment. And we think it's going to create great opportunities for us and for our customers and for our manufacturers, so we're excited about it. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : George, maybe if I can just ask one follow-up question on AssuraMed. In your prepared remarks, you seem to suggest that the deal is sort of outperforming your original deal model. I was wondering if you could elaborate like where's the source of upside coming from? And then, Jeff, as sort of we think about the outperformance in the quarter, I think we're all trying to sort of figure out where the incremental benefit's coming from, like how would you stack the potential outperformance of AssuraMed on the current quarter and the decision to raise the guidance for fiscal '14? George S. Barrett: So, Glen, I'll start. Here's what I would say about -- if you remember, when we acquired AssuraMed, we told you that, essentially, it has 2 components. One is basically a B2B business and one is more of a B2C part of the business. The part that we're seeing more dramatic uptake is in the B2C side. And so we expected that, systemically, this would be an area of growth. We think that their demographics are clear, that more patients will be treated in the home. And then as you also know, hospitals will be penalized for readmissions. And so I do think that we expect sort of systemic growth here. We also believe that we have a certain kind of scale, a tremendous sort of billing capabilities, a very high-touch model and that we're an attractive referral here. So what's happening is we're getting perfect [ph] referrals from physicians, from payers that's driving that business, and I think our high-touch model really worked. So I think that's the part of the business that I would say has been driving it and probably outperforming. Jeffrey W. Henderson: So Glen, just continuing on that, just going through the various elements of the business. On the Medical side, I would say, as we said, the AssuraMed has outperformed our original view of expectations and it continues to grow very well. But I wouldn't necessarily say it was the biggest surprise in the quarter. We expected it to do well, and it delivered on that. Elsewhere on the Med side, I think the growth of our strategic accounts has been a very positive surprise for us. We've invested a lot in those accounts in terms of products and services, and we expected good things. But I think we've seen some growth that is even above what we would've expected, so that was great to see. On the Pharma side, I would say there were 4 or 5 areas that performed better than we expected in Q2. Generic inflation was better as we alluded to. The core performance of the generics portfolio was better than we expected. Brand inflation was a little bit better than we expected. And both specialty and Nuclear outperformed our expectations in Q2. So I hope you can understand why we're pretty excited about the quarter. We saw a lot of very good results across-the-board. It's probably driven by the environment, granted, but a lot also driven by just the strong performance of our organization. Operator : We'll now move to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Maybe just staying with the Medical for a second here, obviously we've talked a lot about AssuraMed, can you talk about how we're doing with Preferred products, and was that a big contributor in the growth in the strategic accounts? And then really, where do we think we're going here in terms of the pipeline of products in terms of sort of what type of technology are we going after at this point? George S. Barrett: So again, I'll start, Charles. Yes, I would say the preferred product portfolio is going really well. I mentioned that our first 6 months was an extremely high run rate relative to anything we've done historically. Again, with, again, that typically sort of had their waves of product, and we had to sort of map that through the year. We expected good performance, and thankfully, our teams are really executing on that. I think this is really, as I said earlier, it's a pain point for customers -- for our customers. They have enormously high spend in sort of the complexity of their supply -- number of -- of products that they carry, and, essentially, helping them build a formula that's more efficient is really an opportunity for them. So this is sort of that classic win-win situation where we believe that we can move share from manufacturers, whether that's our own product or someone else's. We, because we move share, we capture some of the margin and we can create value for our customers downstream, and that's sort of the key to it. It's going well. I'm not sure it's the sole explanation for why our strategic accounts are doing well. I think that's sort of a combination of things. I think we've identified complex systems who have complex needs. They're no longer, for example, simply a hospital and maybe a clinic. They're now multiple hospitals with multiple clinics and cancer centers and surgery centers and maybe affiliated doctors' offices, and I think they're increasingly looking for companies that have the tools to sort of be a solution provider and help them deal with very changing environment. I think that's been at the heart of it. I think our team has identified those kinds of customers with those distinct needs. And I think that's allowed us to do a better job of serving them. And we're going to work really hard to continue to provide new services and offerings that allow them to compete in a rapidly changing environment. Jeff, anything to add there? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, I would say Preferred products were a driver of dollar growth in the quarter. And I think what was also very exciting was the continued increase we're seeing of Preferred products in our overall portfolio as a percent of gross margin. As you may recall at our Investor Day, Don Casey indicated that our target was to get the Preferred products to at least mid-40s%, 45% as a percent of gross profit for the segment by fiscal '17. And for reference, he gave a historical number, which was in the mid-30%s. Actually, in our Q2, I would describe that percentage mid- to upper-30%s. So we've already seen a tick up, and we expect to continue that trend over the next couple of years as we achieve our target. So yes, there are a lot of things that are driving the overall net margin expansion in Med. Obviously, the growth of the home health platform, the growth of strategic accounts and Preferred products were all important drivers of that very impressive margin rate increase in the quarter. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : In terms of the Preferred products, I mean, in terms of the type of products you're doing, I know you're talking about like -- you've talked in the past, in the trauma kit. I don't know, you've kind of touched on it in the past here and there. Any potential to sort of move up the technology ladder, or is that something to think about in the future? George S. Barrett: Yes. So this really relates, I think, in many ways to the sort of what we think of as the physician preference items. We've started -- if there's a spectrum : at one end being products that are extremely highly clinically differentiated; then the other end, products that tend to be really not clinically differentiated. We've sort of focused on the lower end, and I think that makes sense as we're sort of building presence and building credibility in the market with this program. So trauma was a very smart place for us to start. There's a huge amount of interest from our customers, and we're working there up the Ortho line. Wound management is another area that we've been working on. So we are carefully analyzing every line with this question of where -- how much clinical differentiation exists in a given product line and where does it not exist. And I think that's allowed us to start to build sort of a strategy of moving along that spectrum. And we're still at the sort of early end of that. But I'm very excited about it. I think our customers will see a big opportunity if we can continue to execute. Operator : We'll move now to Tom Gallucci with FBR Capital Markets. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : I guess, just one set of housekeeping item and then another sort of follow up on some other questions that you've already answered. Just, you mentioned the pull-forward of a little brand and price inflation from what you expected in the March quarter. Can you frame at all what we're talking about there, roughly speaking, Jeff? Jeffrey W. Henderson: It was probably worth a couple of pennies of earnings shift, Tom. Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, you mentioned a few different times the better growth of your strategic customers on the med-surg side. And I think, George, a question or 2 ago, you started to get into a little bit of what you're doing there, can you just get a little bit more granular? I'm curious about the types of services that you're starting to offer there incrementally to some of these types of accounts? Is it a matter of -- is there buying physicians and you can also service physicians? Or just the mix of things that you're doing would be helpful. George S. Barrett: Yes. Sure, Tom. I mean, this is, again, it's a bit of a long story, so I'll try to summarize it. So obviously, we can provide the traditional medical/surgical supplies that we've always been able to do. We also can support them both in their acute-care centers and in their ambulatory centers within a line of products that includes surgical kits. We can do freight management. We can do RFID tagging. We do consulting on operational excellence. We do what we call ValueLink, which is essentially where we actually stage all the materials in our warehouses, so it's a purely, truly just-in-time system. So I think we can tell them, we can serve both your acute-care centers, we can serve your oncology clinic, we can serve your physicians' offices. So it's a combination of lines of business and touch points across what is an increasingly complex system, the entire continuum. And in many cases, we can follow that patient to the home. And so that's the overall picture. And I think the more the system integrates, the more complexity is introduced into it, the more that plays to our ability to say, \"I think we can provide some solutions to deal with this complexity.\" Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Right. And you're clearly gaining business with existing customers. Are you winning new customers of this nature as well, given the breadth of product that you can offer? George S. Barrett: I would say -- I don't know that there has been a monumental change in market share. I think we're doing a really good job with our key customers. I think we've done some segmentation to know who's likely to be a winner and most likely to be able to draw on the tools that we bring. There's always some movement up and down of customers back and forth. But I don't think there's been huge share swings as much as it's been our ability to drive value for existing customers as they change their configuration. I think we have seen a share of wallet changes though within the hospitals where we may have been servicing the hospital itself, and we were able to win their large ambulatory network as a result of that experience. And those are the customers that are actually winning in the market right now, these large complex IDNs that have both strong acute settings, but also ambulatory settings that are tending to be the hospitals that are winning share in the market and being very successful. And then obviously, those are important customers to win with. Operator : We'll move now to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, on the drug distribution side of your business, I think, Jeff, you called out in the quarter that you had impact from new customers, as well as expanding relationships. Can you talk about maybe the size of the impact, if any, of new customers in the quarter? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I would say, they're a relatively modest size. There were no huge changes of customers in the quarter. I would describe them as small to mid-size. But we continue to make good progress, with picking up some new customers and, as I said, our existing customers showed good growth in the quarter. So in both respects, it was very positive. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And the growth of your existing customers, is that now that you're distributing more generics, distributing more product or is it just the growth of the existing customers that you have? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I would say both. I mean, it depends on the customer. Fortunately, we have some very strong customers in the market, CVS, for example, which continues to post very good results and obviously, we benefit from that as well. But in addition, we continue to sell customers the opportunities to buy more products from us, including generics, and we continue to have good success in doing that. And will continue to be a big theme of ours as we go out to increase our share of wallet with customers, if not win some new -- small to mid-size customers. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You've also commented a lot, say, about the hospital network accounts and the ability to build out Preferred products and now there is [ph]. Is there any way to quantify what the white space opportunity is with these accounts, number one? And number two, where are you taking that business from, is that from other smaller distributors, are they self-distributing in the hospital today? George S. Barrett: So let me start. We probably can't give complete line of sight on the opportunity. I would say that it's really sort of early days. So today, we're just really scratching the surface on the acute-care side, which has been primarily where our Preferred products have been going. What's really interesting is our customers, those 10 customers are beginning to realize that there's real value driver. Because I think, in a sense, Lisa, it's not going to be enough for people to squeeze 1 more basis point out of a procurement. What really is going to matter is changing behavior and consolidating the number of products that you use, being more efficient about that, is a change of behavior that can really be valuable to a system. The other thing I would note is that we basically have had no Preferred product position in the ambulatory care to-date or in the home, very little. And so, I think we see opportunities to expand in the acute-care centers, but also in these other channels where basically we haven't really even touched the opportunity. So we're pretty excited about this, because it really is kind of a sort of change of behavior that has material value to our customers versus just squeezing out 1 more basis point from the supply system. The second part, I think, Jeff. I'll let Jeff. Jeffrey W. Henderson: A few comments to add there, Lisa. First of all, again, because our focus has been on some of these larger, more complex accounts, those also tend to be the accounts that have been continuing to consolidate, bought, buy [ph] others. And obviously, we benefit as they buy others, whether it'd be smaller hospitals or surgery centers or physician offices and as they continue to get bigger and more complex, both our size and our ability to service them there uniquely grows as well. But from a one point, to I'd state, in some cases, we're doing work that was previously done by the hospital itself. And really, that is a significant goal of ours to help the hospital focus on treating patients and allow us to manage their supply chain in a more comprehensive manner. And when we can do that, that's very much a win-win usually for the hospital and us, and then, I think in a couple of cases where we've picked up some additional ambulatory business that sort of -- was part of a larger hospital, they probably were some smaller players that were servicing those accounts that didn't necessarily have the ability to compete with us on the whole network. So it's -- all 3 of those have been part of the driving force. George S. Barrett: I'd probably just want to add again, just as a reminder, it is a tough system out there. So the other thing that we tried to do is really focused on efficiency. And you've heard us talk about that over the last year. And so it's both creating the opportunities for those customers and also recognizing that, in this kind of system, we've got to be incredibly efficient and we work really hard at that. Operator : And we'll move now to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I guess, George or Jeff, as we look at the inflationary environment in the branded drug space recognizing that the old spec buying days of 2004 and 2005 are behind us. How should we think about kind of the company's leverage to -- and kind of profit contribution from -- that you're able to capture from this kind of pretty high branded drug inflationary environment? And maybe could you -- can you give us an update on whether we want to think about it on a quarterly or an annual basis, how much of operating earnings in the drug segment is coming from your ability to capture a spread on branded drug price increases? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. It's less than 20% of our branded gross margin now. And I would say, overall for the segment, it's well under 10% of the gross margin of the segment. So it's not near the significant swing factor that it would have been 5 or 10 years ago. And honestly, generally we're pretty good at predicting what the impact will be for the full year. I think the difficulty we always have, especially, these days, is guessing which quarter it's going to be in. So it does have the ability to swing a quarter fairly materially, and as I said, the swing from Q3 to Q2 probably, was about a $0.02 swing. But over the course of the year, it's a factor, but becoming increasingly less of a factor, and as I said, less than 10% of our gross margin in the segment. George S. Barrett: And I would also add that particularly these very expensive drugs -- biopharmaceutical companies are very careful about how they do this and manage it pretty carefully. So it's not a giant swing factor for us. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the med-surg. Can you talk about the margin expansion -- kind of the core business x the AssuraMed business? So we talked earlier that AssuraMed's outperforming kind of the acquisition model. How is the business x AssuraMed performing from a gross margin perspective? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, I don't want to break down too much here, because AssuraMed is pretty much a part of our overall Medical segment. But obviously, it was a significant driver for the quarter. I would say, excluding AssuraMed, our revenue growth overall in the Medical segment was in the lower-single digits. And we felt some slight margin expansion on that. George S. Barrett: And that's primarily mix. Operator : We'll move now to John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : George, can you give us any observations on health care consumption? Did you see any interesting shifts, either from a third [ph] perspective or the early impact of the ACA? George S. Barrett: For that, I wish I could answer that one, John. I'm going to try, though. It is been -- and you probably heard this from other companies, really difficult to tease out a discernible trend on overall utilization and consumption. You probably heard some people talk about sort of late year spiking and whether not that might have to do with some benefit design issues around the system. I've heard people speculate that there were some apprehension about whether or not -- the changes in policy of the Affordable Care Act might influence their future access to -- their position. And so we tried to sort of look at all that. But to be really honest, we just can't tease it out. There are so many moving parts, so I don't think I could say there's a discernible trend. What we can say is, we see a procedure utilization. So there are certain things that we can see. We see in-hospital, ambulatory and what I would say is that, that trend -- the softness that we're seeing in acute-care procedures is probably one that we would highlight. But I don't know that I could say, we could identify a particular trend right now, just because there's so much noise in the system and so many moving parts. And I think it's just going to take a while for this to shake out. We've not seen -- I would say any uplift, and I'm sure you've heard, as you follow the insurers, any particular uplift from new patients in the system yet, not at this stage. Just one additional comment on utilization. We always tend to focus on the hospital and physicians' office settings, but, I think it's important to keep in mind that we have another very important channel and that's the home, and we still see that market growing at a rate of 6% to 8%, which is obviously very encouraging and very important going forward. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Excellent. And just a quick follow-up. You referenced to some newer customers within pharma. Are you having -- or seeing any discussions about some of the self-warehousing change, shifting any generic purchasing back into the distribution channel? George S. Barrett: Let me touch that. I think there is -- I'll do this carefully. I think there is an interesting evaluation that any company now has to do as it relates to their own scale relative to what's happening systemically. I do think that may raise some interesting opportunities, but I do think that the gap between some of the larger players and the larger purchasers of generics, and smallers -- it might be widening. And so, if I am a smaller player now, I'd probably have to think carefully about what's the most efficient way for me to source my generic products. And I do think that given some of the changes in the market, there's probably a lot of, I would say, probably, a lot of evaluation going on in many offices to try to figure out the most efficient way, given some of the dynamics in the market. So we're hoping that, that represents an opportunity for us, but it's too early to say. Operator : We'll move to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : So just going back to Charles' earlier question. George, you had mentioned that if you think about the spectrum : to the left, not really clinically relevant; to the right, very clinically relevant PPIs. And you talked about the fact that Preferred products are contributing about 35 -- I think you said mid- to upper-30% of medical gross profit. So is it safe to say that the driver of that increase has really been to the left, so the lower end PP -- at the lower end consumables? And I guess, as you think about, as you move up the technology scale towards the higher end PPIs, is that what takes you from, say, 35% of gross profit to, say, 45% of gross profit by fiscal '17? George S. Barrett: Greg, it's a good question. And I think -- I am going to try answer this along 2 dimensions. Well, the first part is, yes, because you asked about whether or not it's primarily on the lower end, the left if we were diagramming it. I think the answer to that is, yes. It's clearly on the more commoditized end today. So think about growth, our growth plans work along 2 dimensions. You might even say 3. Let's say dimension one : Increase penetration with existing accounts, who tend to be acute-care hospital focused from as long as [indiscernible] most procedures are. So that's one dimension. Second dimension would be our new channels. So as those opportunities might arise in surgery centers or ambulatory settings, that's a second dimension. And the third, which is actually really exciting, is moving along that spectrum, would be moving upward and to the right towards products that, actually, when you really examine the data, you discover that are probably not clinically all that referenced. So it's really both going forward, with [indiscernible] physician referenced items. And probably if we look at a time horizon, it sort of the new product adding new dimensions is probably a little bit further out as we go, and that's from the time respect [ph]. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And then -- just real quickly. How would you characterize the commoditization of PPIs? I mean, I'm assuming that's a good guide for you in profitability. Any kind of update on what you're seeing out in the marketplace, George. Just as it relates to PPIs that were once seen as, well, PPIs, but now becoming more, I guess, commoditized? I mean stents kind of come to mind, but any comments there? George S. Barrett: Yes, certainly not about stents, but about the general direction. Here's what I would say. I think this is not a new discovery. I mean, I think if you look inside a complex health system, they would probably understand that historically, the departments sort of ruled and so what happened was every department has their own preferences, physicians have their own preferences and the system was able to accommodate that. But I think, it's been understood for quite some time that, that probably could be done more efficiently. Here's a noteworthy change. The noteworthy change, is that given some very different environmental forces, the more senior folks in the hospital are more aligned with the fact that something needs to be done about this, and I want to actually say that physicians are on board as well. So I think there's more of an awareness inside that health system with a changing demographic and a changing regulatory environment and changing reimbursement environment, that they need to focus on this area of inefficiency and we're helping them do that. So if that makes sense to you. So it's not just our promoting it, it's hospitals and health systems recognizing that they should take action on it, and I think that's probably a noteworthy change over these last year or 2. Operator : We'll move to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So the 54 bps margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was obviously quite strong. I guess, would you say, most of that would you say was tied to the core operational improvement? Or is it possible that the rolloff of the lower-margin Y [ph] contract contributed a major portion of that? How would you characterize each of those without getting too specific? Just trying to get a feel for that. Jeffrey W. Henderson: It's Jeff. I would say there are 3 significant drivers. The largest one, by far, was the performance of generics, both our core performance and the impact of price inflation. Second, was the rolloff of the WAG, which as you would expect, was lower-margin business than our average business in pharma. And then, I think, third was slightly higher brand inflation than we saw last year in Q2. Those were all 3, I'd say, material drivers, in that order. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. One other quick one. Just I think if I heard you right, you mentioned that because the just reported quarter was so strong, that the historical pattern of the Pharma Distribution results being stronger than March quarter versus the December quarter may not necessarily repeat themselves this time around. But just to clarify, does your comment pertain to the segment operating profit dollars, or the operating margins or both, when doing that sequential comparison? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I was referring to dollars, but I was talking specifically about the impact of brand inflation, which typically is the biggest driver of our seasonal peak in Q3. I would say that will be less of a skewing factor this year than perhaps other years. That make sense? Operator : We'll move now to Bob Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a quick one. Will the CVS joint venture have any discernible working capital effect? And also, on the inventory build in the quarter, a bit surprised, I guess, with the Walgreens business gone, were you not taking title to the Walgreens inventory, is that the situation? Jeffrey W. Henderson: With respect to Walgreens inventory. No, we were taking title to the Walgreens inventory, which is why we recognized the sales on our income statement historically. But I would say, on average, we carried fewer days of inventory for Walgreens than I'd say the pharma segment on average. In part because a good chunk of the Walgreens business was bulk, and we would tend to hold bulk inventory for a relatively short period of time. But had to skew the overall WAG inventory down and make it lower than the overall average. So, that's why you saw an increase because of the mix shift. Bob, I forgot the first part of your question. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : The CVS JV, does it have any balance sheet impact? Jeffrey W. Henderson: No, it does not. There is -- under the current structure, there is no inventory that flows through the JV. So really the only asset the JV has are the physical building it's in and the people that reside in there. The actual product flows flow through the respective companies. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And just on China, I think you mentioned $2.5 billion revenue run rate. It's at a margin better than the base business was my understanding. What is the asset base look like for that business now? Jeffrey W. Henderson: We haven't disclosed this publicly. But I will say that assets in general for businesses in China, particularly in our space, tend to be higher and really referring to working capital. And that's primarily because receivable days with hospitals, just by market convention, tend to be longer in China. They're closer on average to 80 days, and obviously they're much shorter in the U.S. So it is a more working capital-intensive business than our U.S. business. That's also by the way, why, we're looking at other areas to grow into that are much more capital efficient in China. So for example, our direct-to-patient business is a very asset-light business for the most part. So we continue to look for ways to improve our mix and improve our return on capital. Operator : And we'll take Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Most of my topics have been covered at this point, but just a couple of quick ones. Specialty growth, I know you said it's strong, but I didn't catch the rate. And if you can talk about what classes of trade and maybe what therapeutic classes you're seeing the best trends in? And then just one quick follow-up. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, the revenue growth for Specialty Solutions was 38% in the second quarter, which obviously continues the good revenue growth trend we've seen over the past couple of years. I would say the bulk of our business is still in the oncology space. We continue to build out into other areas, like rheumatoid arthritis and a few other emerging areas. But the bulk of the growth to-date has been in the oncology space. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And Jeff, what specific trades to classify [ph] on oncology. Is it community, is it outpatient hospital, where are you seeing the biggest demand? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Most of that growth is driven by sales through community oncologists. I will say, though, that we have seen a shift, and it's been a fairly well publicized shift over the past year or so of more infusions happening in hospital settings as the community oncologists have generally shrunk over the past year or so. That all said, the community space is still a very important and robust one and really, a very important part of our business and our growth story going forward. Operator : And our final question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : I think, if I heard you correctly, yes, the Walgreens revenue impact was about $5 billion. So I'm just looking on a year-over-year basis, if I back $5 billion out of fiscal 2Q '13, you still beat by, like $1.7 billion in terms of top line growth. And I think you mentioned that the new customers were somewhat modest in size. Can you just talk about the revenue upside, where that came from just generally, please? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Well, I mean, modest in size is a relative term, right? Just given the nature of pharma, it doesn't take a whole lot of customers to have a pretty significant dollar increase in revenue. And we saw good growth from our existing customers. It was really a combination of both of those. But your point that the revenue upside in pharma was a positive surprise to what a lot of people were expecting, I would agree with you. And, quite frankly, it was better than our plans as well. And I think that's a testament to our sales teams who have done a great job over the past year going out and letting customers know what we have to offer, offering creative solutions, and [indiscernible] pick up share of wallet. So, yes, I think the underlying trend that you pointed out was a very positive one. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just one more quick one. In terms of your specialty capabilities, has there been any impact from sequestration at all or not really? And then, in terms of your relationship with CVS, could that longer term possibly be a way to sort of expand your specialty business? George S. Barrett: Yes, I'll take it. I think -- again, restate the first part on the special question? David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Impact from sequestration or not, I imagine not. George S. Barrett: Yes. It certainly had an impact on customers across the system. I think it had a very, very modest impact on our business. As Jeff mentioned, we've been building scale. We've not been terribly exposed to some of the dynamics that were associated with the sequestration. So certainly as we look around the system, sequestration has been difficult thing for many, many physician groups. But it really did not have much impact on us, just given our model. Again, the second part, I'm sorry, David? David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And long-term, your joint venture with CVS, I imagine there might be ways to sort of grow that relationship? George S. Barrett: Yes. So here's the way you ought to think about this : I think our joint venture itself is really dedicated to the global procurement of generic products for the U.S. market specifically. Obviously, our relationship with CVS Caremark is deep, and having this joint venture certainly, only strengthens it. So we'll continue to look for opportunities to see how we can collaborate in areas that create value, and if specialty is one of those areas, certainly, we will explore it. But don't think of it as a part of the joint venture. I would think, just to make life simple, think of the joint venture as specifically dedicated to this generic procurement strategy, but certainly we'll explore and continue to explore other ways to create value for one another. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett: So, look, it's been a longer call, but great questions, and we appreciate that. All the good questions. We appreciate your continued interest in Cardinal Health, and I wish all of you the best for the New Year. And we'll see you all soon. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett: Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone. We had a solid third quarter operating performance. Our businesses are competing well, and the moves we're making continue to position Cardinal Health on the right side of health care trends. Based on our work through 9 months and what we're seeing in our markets, we are reaffirming the guidance we've provided this January of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.85. Total revenues for the third quarter were $21.4 billion, a decline of 13% versus last year's third quarter. This decline was expected, as last year's revenue number included sales under our now-expired Walgreens supply agreement. Our gross margin rate expanded by nearly 80 basis points to 6% for the quarter. Our third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.01, down from $1.20 last year, for reasons that Jeff and I will cover later in our remarks. When we initially provided guidance last August, we anticipated an unusual year given the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Now after completing 3 quarters, I want to acknowledge our entire team for executing against our strategic goals and for the 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth that they've delivered year-to-date. Now on to the segments, starting with Pharmaceutical. As expected, revenues for our Pharmaceutical segment declined 15%, which was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Strong performance from our generic programs helped to partially offset the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, resulting in a 9% segment profit decline for the quarter. I'm extremely proud the way over our Pharmaceutical Distribution team is competing in a unique transition year. For the period, revenue increases outperformed the market in all classes of trade, obviously with the exception of chain pharmacy. Our 50-50 generic drug joint venture with CVS Caremark is making progress, and our teams are deeply engaged in working through all the details so that we'll be able to -- excuse me, that we will meet our target go-live date, which we have said would be as early as July 1. The new venture will operate under the name Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, will be comprised of key talent from both Cardinal Health and CVS Caremark and will be located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. At the same time, we continue to build strength with our other customer groups. For example, we just recently renewed our Pharmaceutical Distribution agreement with Kmart, one of our larger generic customers. For independent pharmacists, we continue to broaden our set of offerings. As a recent example, we have a new suite of offerings designed to help pharmacy owners navigate the new reimbursement requirements for the CMS Star Ratings. Our program focuses on providing insights on how best to achieve the quality ratings, which are now so important to inclusion in networks. We continue to believe that pharmacy will play an expanding role in our health care system, and we are committed to the industry to help enable this growing role. Our Specialty Solutions group continues to deliver excellent growth. We are sustaining our strong upward trend in our core specialty distribution and our platform to support our biopharmaceutical partners. During this recent quarter, we announced the acquisition of Sonexus Health. Sonexus Health offers biopharma manufacturers comprehensive commercialization solutions in the U.S., including access in patient support, distribution and pharmacy services, all aimed toward ensuring patients receive and successfully complete the therapies they need. Sonexus Health complements and grows our current specialty team's offerings and creates a truly best-in-class patient-centric hub. Based on all available data, more new specialty medicines were brought to market in 2013 than ever before, and we know this is a health care area in which we will play an increasingly important role. I'll end with just a quick note on our Nuclear business. We did see some revenue and profit increase in the quarter compared to a year ago. This is certainly good news, and we appreciate the team's hard work. Our Medical segment performance was solid. Revenue was up 7% to $2.7 billion, and segment profit increased 11%. There was, however, a discernible softness in utilization during the quarter, some of which would seem to be weather-related, but which is extremely difficult for us to precisely quantify. We did see increased penetration in our targeted strategic accounts, but our progress during the quarter was slowed somewhat by utilization softness and by volume shortfalls in our surgical kitting business. Having said this, we are continuing to build out our preferred products portfolio, and recently took a significant step with the announcement of the acquisition of AccessClosure, a leading manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices in the United States. AccessClosure gives us an outstanding lead product, the Mynx product family. But equally important, it gives us a scalable platform, a strong customer base, a low-cost service model and a seasoned management team. As you know, last year we launched our orthopedic trauma solutions to an enthusiastic response, and the acquisition of AccessClosure broadens our offering in another physician preference category. With both cardiovascular and orthopedic trauma product lines, we can now address some of the most significant customer pain points. Our medical consumables business continues to grow faster than the market, driven by share gains from new product launches as well as from new channel penetration. We're also driving growth in our consumables in the home health channel through AssuraMed, and recently launched our first products under the Cardinal Health label. AssuraMed continues to contribute meaningful profit growth and margin accretion for the Medical segment. Edgepark, the direct-to-consumer business, reported especially strong revenue and margin expansion as patient count continues to grow. It's just common sense that our health care system will have to take a more active approach to managing the growing population of people who need care in the home. And we have moved decisively in this space. We see a system in need of innovative ways to reduce cost, while at the same time, improving quality, safety and the patient experience. These are not mutually exclusive goals. And with this in mind, we built a strong capability and contemporary Lean Six Sigma methods, and recently launched an educational program for health care providers in partnership with the Ohio State University's Fisher College Center for Operational Excellence. This program, the Academy for Excellence in Health Care, is targeted at acute care and surgical centers, focuses on clinical and operational performance management and uses experts from Cardinal Health and the OSU faculty. Our initial sessions addressed issues raised by participants from leading health systems, and some of those topics included the patient care model, improving the pre-procedure experience, inventory management of high-cost specialty pharmaceuticals and improving post-anesthesia care unit throughput. Turning to China. We had another quarter of very strong growth on both the revenue and gross margin lines. And as we've told you before, the business is on track to deliver about $2.5 billion in sales this fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about its growth potential. We will continue to play a meaningful role in China's health care evolution by playing out our strategy of enlarging our geographic footprint, creating new business partnerships and bringing our expertise to new opportunities, such as direct-to-patient. As an example, similar to what we do in the United States, we're supporting China's hospital [indiscernible] Initiative by working closely with hospital pharmacies and introducing hospital pharmacy management and services. We now have 10 hospital pharmacy pilot projects with some of the largest hospitals in China. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to welcome David Anderson to the Cardinal Health Board of Directors. Dave has an extraordinary track record and recently retired from his position as Senior Vice President and CFO of Honeywell. We look forward to Dave's contributions, drawn on his 2 decades of experience as CFO of high-performing public companies. And with that, I'll hand the call off to Jeff. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, George, and hello, everyone. Let me begin by echoing George's comments regarding our year-to-date results. Delivering 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth given the Walgreens headwind we faced coming into the year is a testament to the organization's performance focus and the strength of our business portfolio. Now on to the third quarter results. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported a 3% decrease in non-GAAP operating earnings in our fiscal '14 third quarter versus the prior year period, driven by the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 met our expectations, but were down year-on-year. In addition to the contract expiration, this decline was also driven by an unfavorable tax rate comparison versus the prior year period, which had included a positive tax settlement worth $0.18 per share. I'll now go through the rest of the income statement in a bit more detail, starting with revenue. As expected, consolidated sales were down 13% to $21.4 billion. Gross margin dollars increased slightly versus prior year, and we continued our strong track record of margin expansion, with the rate increasing almost 80 basis points. SG&A expenses rose 3% in Q3, primarily driven by acquisitions, including AssuraMed. Our core SG&A was essentially flat year-over-year, evidence of our enterprise-wide commitment to controlling costs and to adjusting our expense base in response to changes in our customer mix. We remain focused on improving the efficiency of our operations while continuing to invest in our key strategic priorities. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 26 basis points to 2.6%. Moving below the operating line, interest and other expense came in $28 million better than Q3 in the prior year's quarter. This is mostly due to a $0.06 per share gain related to the sale of a minority equity interest in 2 investments. Recall that last quarter we mentioned a possible gain, which is reflected in the revised guidance range we provided at the time. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.7%, in line with our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, this was a tough compare versus the prior year's unusually low 25.1%, again, a result of an $0.18 benefit realized in that period. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 346.8 million for the third quarter, about 2 million higher than last year. During the quarter, we repurchased $340 million worth of shares, which brings our fiscal year-to-date purchases to about $390 million. At the end of March, we had just over $1 billion remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, and so far this fiscal year have returned to $700 million to shareholders in the form of share repo and dividends. Now let's discuss consolidated cash flows on the balance sheet. We generated $820 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, OCF of $1.8 billion is slightly favorable to our expectations and reflects the net positive benefit of unwinding the Walgreens contract. As we previously noted, there is typically a large degree of operating cash flow variability from quarter-to-quarter, and we expect our Q4 operating cash flow to be quite light. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes approximately $480 million held internationally. As a reminder, our acquisition of AccessClosure is expected to close in the coming weeks and that will result in a net outflow of $320 million to complete the deal. Our working capital days decreased versus prior year, primarily due to the Walgreens contract expiration, which reduced our days sales outstanding. Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first. Pharma segment revenue posted a decrease of 15% versus the prior year period to $18.8 billion. The prior period included approximately $5 billion of sales related to the Walgreens contract. The current period includes strong sales growth from new and existing customers. I'll note 2 other items. First, as George mentioned, our revenue growth was strong in each of the Pharma Distribution channels, excluding chain, of course. Second, our other Pharma segment businesses have strong revenue growth compared to the prior year period, including China, specialty, and somewhat surprisingly, Nuclear. Pharma segment profit decreased by 9% to $452 million, driven by the Walgreens contract expiration. The decline was partially offset by strong performance from our generics programs. With respect to generics, sales and profits from total generics programs exhibited very good year-on-year growth in the quarter. This is a result of the emphasis we have placed on building the strength of our programs over the last several years, the overall robustness of the market and the effect of specific manufacturer price increases. Let me provide a little more detail. First, our generic source sales continue to be strong, up 19% for the quarter. Second, we saw slightly more contribution from new generic launches in the third quarter versus the prior year period. The net effect of generic manufacturer price changes on our portfolio sales resulted in slight inflation in the third quarter. Finally, in Q3, we continued to see some generic manufacturer price increases on a relatively small basket of products. Compared to Q2 we realized a sequential decline in related margin benefit. Looking ahead, there's a fair degree of uncertainty with respect to Q4. And as we've noted in the past, we have been relatively conservative in our modeling of the -- of this contribution because it is so difficult to predict. I'll also note that we saw brand inflation in the low-double digits, which was slightly better than we expected. On our Q2 call, we mentioned this quarter is typically our strongest quarter for brand inflation benefit, but that we had also experienced what we thought was about a $0.02 swing from this quarter that we realized in Q2. Finally, I'll note that the Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 15 basis points compared to the prior year's Q3 due to our mix of higher-margin business this year. Now moving onto Medical segment performance. For the third quarter, Medical revenue grew 7%. The segment profit was up a solid 11%, with the profit rate expanding by 15 basis points. Top and bottom line performance is primarily a result of our movement to home health and the integration of AssuraMed, which has gone well. For AssuraMed, we continue to be on track to achieve our original estimate of least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. As a reminder, we lapped the timing of this acquisition in Q3. In addition to our home health platform, our strategic IDN accounts also continued to grow, the result of our focus on these very large networks of hospitals and ambulatory sites that tend to buy a lot of our products and services because of their complex operations. It was particularly rewarding to see this growth in a slow utilization environment. The segment's performance was partially moderated by the effect of overall procedural volume softness and reductions in Presource kitting volumes. Now a quick note on Cardinal Health China, which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China again posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 33%. We noted last quarter that the overall pharma market in China had been experiencing some turbulence due largely to the impact of some government regulatory actions to improve the integrity of the system. It appears the impact of these actions on growth is diminishing. However, growth is still not back to what we've been seeing prior to these actions. Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The variance in non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which reduced our GAAP results by $0.10 per share. In Q3 of last year, GAAP results were $0.20 lower than non-GAAP results. Switching gears, let me provide a few comments regarding our expectations for the balance of this fiscal year. We are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS range of $3.75 to $3.85. In past years, we would typically be narrowing our range going into the fourth quarter. However, this year, we had a couple of fairly large swing factors that still have a fair amount of potential variability to them. Specifically, achieving the upper half of our guidance range will mostly be dependent on 2 factors in particular : first, a return to the levels of benefit from generic manufacturer price increases that we saw in Q2 of this year; and second, realization of our Q4 tax rate, which resulted in us achieving the low end of the provided full year tax rate range. In closing, we are pleased with our results so far this fiscal year. Our presence across the continuum of care provides balance to our performance, and we believe this is a strong strategic advantage for our customers. Our talented team continues to drive results and remains focused on serving our customers well and executing against our strategic priorities. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : A couple of quick questions here. Let me start with the Medical segment. So obviously, with the Medical segment, with the acquisition in the quarter, what's the feedback that you're getting from the IDNs and how their kind of like thinking about you increasing your scope in medical devices? And are they more open to some kind of like the genericization [ph] of devices? George S. Barrett: Ricky, it's George. I'll take that. Yes, I think we're going to get great response from IDNs and health system partners on our program. I think everybody's looking for new ways to do business, recognizing the world is changing. They're very much aware that, in particular, there's a whole category of what they think of as physician preference items, which caused a kind of inefficiency in the system. So I think we're touching a part of their overall cost structure that is really meaningful, and that's -- as you know, we started in the orthopedic space, particularly along the trauma line, which is probably the most commoditized of the kinds of products, we're getting really good response. We've actually been expanding our program that we launched with a relatively small line of products. That product line is expanding, and hopefully, over the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be able to describe a pretty significant expansion of that. Our entry into the sort of cardiovascular with the acquisition of AccessClosure is a really important step for us, and primarily, today, that work is being done in the cath lab. But it really opens up doors for us. And again, I think our customers recognize this is a place to really alter behavior, to increase standardization, which they know is going to be central to being able to manage cost and getting the right outcomes. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And is the relationship directly with the IDNs? Or are you also going through the GPOs? George S. Barrett: It's really both, it's really both. So we've naturally -- we are -- we have to have those direct touch points to the IDNs and to specific hospitals, but we continue to work closely with GPOs as well. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And just my last question, and maybe you've mentioned it in the prepared remarks and I missed it. But obviously, a lot of uncertainty around the expectations for Nexium and Diovan, and it seems that different companies are taking different approaches. So is the [indiscernible] contribution from Nexium in 4Q guidance or did you take it out? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Hey, Ricky, this is Jeff. Good question actually. In our internal forecast, we're not really counting on any benefit from either Nexium or Diovan this year. In fact, the benefit from those potential launches, for us, is probably more of a first half of fiscal '15 event. Operator : We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Yes. I might have missed it a little bit earlier, but when I look at the revenues in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, the March quarter, I generally think of it being -- correct me if I'm wrong, I generally thought of the March quarter as sort of your strongest revenue quarter in distribution generally, on par with the December quarter. But we see a fairly steep drop-off here. Can you touch on what other factors might have been affecting that? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, thanks, Charles. This is Jeff. I'll try to take that. Actually, I would describe the revenue in Q3 as quite strong. If you actually strip out the Walgreens impact for our Pharmaceutical business, which, I think, is what you're referring to, we actually grew over 9% with the rest of the business. And that really reflects strength across the board. As both George and I alluded to, we had above-market growth in all of our channels in Pharma Distribution with the exception of chain, and that was obviously driven by the Walgreens loss. But on top of that, if you look at the rest of the businesses within Pharma, we had great growth in specialty, 33% growth in China, good growth in Nuclear, which, as I've said, was somewhat of a surprise but a very positive one, obviously. So we actually feel very good about the underlying growth that we saw in Q3. Now is it possible -- that all said, is it possible that there was some dampening of script volumes in Q3 because of the weather? We've been hearing from some of our customers that, that in fact was the case. And so if there was any dampening in Q3, that might have been a factor that was driving it. But as I said, our underlying growth was strong at in excess of 9%, excluding the Walgreens impact. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So would you -- is it fair to say you didn't see really any weather -- I mean, when you book revenues, is it when you ship to your customers? So unless you got stopped by the weather to deliver, does that affect how you book your revenues? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, obviously, we book them when we ship. We sort of get the second order impact from any weather-related issues. Like I said, a few of our Pharma customers did mention that the script volume may have been impacted by the weather to some degree. Again, it's always tough for us to calculate that very specifically because of the second-order effect. But based on what we're hearing, there probably was some moderation from that. I'd say on the medical side, it's probably a little bit easier to calculate, although still difficult. We definitely saw some weather impact on our lab business, and it also appears to have impacted physicians' office and hospital business as well. So I would say overall, for our company, there was a slowdown in utilization related to the weather, although again trying to quantify that specifically, given the nature of our business, is somewhat difficult. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just one quick follow-up on Medical. You kind of talked about sort of softness in the Presource kitting. Is the Presource kitting, is that where you do -- is that the trauma kit where you're -- or where you have a lot of the preferred products going into? Jeffrey W. Henderson: No. Presource kitting refers to the surgical kits that we -- surgical kits that we prepare for surgical procedures in the hospital. And outpatient and surgery center facilities. They're usually custom kits that are prepared for specific operations. That is separate from our merged [ph] trauma portfolio. Now it could be that some of those trauma products could be in a procedure tray, but when I was referring to the Presource kitting, I was really referring to the broader custom procedure trays that we provide. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So we heard earlier from another peer some conservative commentary looking out over the next 12 months. We'll get guidance from your other peer in a week. Are you at a point in your planning process where you can comment on your expectations over the next 12 to 18? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Hey, Eric, it's Jeff. I'm probably going to frustrate you a little bit with my response. But the simple answer is no. We generally provide our guidance in our Q4 call, which will be in August this year. In main part because we're still going through our planning processes. Until we complete those, we're really not in a position to provide quantitative guidance for our fiscal '15. That all said, let me provide a couple of qualitative comments on drivers and our approach heading into next year, and I'll go through these in no particular order. First, we continue to expect the accretion from the CVS generic sourcing JV, net of the accounting for the quarterly payment to CVS, to be accretive. We said that at our December Investor Day. And based on everything we know to date, we continue to very much expect that to be the case. The other thing I'll mention about the CVS JV, as George said, we're still on track to be up and running as early as July 1. But it'll take time for the contracts to flow through and the benefits to ramp up. So clearly, we're not going to see a lot of benefit day 1. It will progress later, ramp up over the course of our fiscal '15. Second point I'd make is, we're going to continue to maintain our conservative posture with respect to health care utilization. And as we said before, we're not going to try to forecast when ACA volume upticks might kick in. That's proven to be a very difficult proposition. And we decided some time ago that, for the purpose of our internal forecast and planning, we will be relatively conservative and really not try to model when ACA-related volume might kick in. And we expect to continue that as we forecast for fiscal '15 as well. On the subject of being conservative, we're also going to continue to be somewhat conservative when trying to forecast the benefit from generic pricing relative to what we experienced so far in fiscal '14. As I said in my remarks, and as we said multiple times, generic price increases from manufacturers are a very difficult thing to predict, given the fact that it affects a very small part of the overall portfolio, less than 5% of our products. So again, we're going to continue to be somewhat conservative in terms of forecasting any benefit we might get from generic price increases. We do expect growth next year in virtually all of our key strategic priority areas, including specialty, China, preferred products and hospital services. As you know, we've continued to focus on those for the past year, invest in those. And I fully expect our fiscal '15 plan will reflect some of the fruits of those investments. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : A commentary I may have expected, but perhaps a little bit more conservative, I guess, the outlier here being that you do expect the JV falling through in line with where you were, that's very much on par. Do you think you'll be in a point to give us guidance in terms of the benefit you're receiving from that when we get full year guidance? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I'm not going sure we're going to give a specific number related to it, quite frankly. But it will be reflected in whatever guidance we give in August, our best estimate of the net accretion that we'll get from that JV. And you stated it correctly, we continue to believe that it will be a net accretion when you add everything up. And then we continue to feel very good about the potential benefit from that JV, again, reflecting that there's going to be a ramp-up period. Operator : We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : George and Jeff, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the previous question about third quarter results relative to kind of where you were just a quarter ago. I mean, you gave a lot of color regarding the year-over-year growth rates. But if I kind of look sequentially from fiscal 2Q to 3Q, your revenues were down pretty sharply in both segments, and your profit was down almost double that rate in both segments or -- and actually even more on the Medical side. And so I hear you kind of called out on some specific drivers, whether it be weather, JVs, lower volumes or lighter generic profitability. I'm just wondering if there was anything else that might help explain or reconcile the sequential decline we saw from fiscal 2Q. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, I am going to speak mainly about profit, Glen. So on the Pharma side, I mentioned that the sequential benefit that we realized from manufacturer price increases on generics wasn't materially less in Q3 than it was in Q2 -- which by the way was pretty consistent with the way we had modeled it as well. So that was a driver of that sequential reduction that you referred to. I also mentioned the fact that although we saw good brand inflation in Q3, there was a partial pull-ahead into Q2 of probably about $0.02, and again, that is something we had referenced during our Q2 call. On the Medical side of things, I would say Q3 was one of the weaker quarters we've seen in terms of overall utilization. How much of that was due to weather? How much of that was due to a lighter flu season? Keep in mind that Q2 was fairly strong from a flu perspective, Q3 was noticeably lighter. But overall, we did see some relatively weak utilization. I'd also say from a year-on-year growth perspective in Q3, we lapped the AssuraMed acquisition in the quarter, so that resulted in some dampening of growth year-on-year. George S. Barrett: I might just add a little color, Glen. From the Pharma standpoint, our Pharmaceutical segment, actually our revenue numbers, again, stripping away the expiration of Walgreens, were really good, actually. So we competed very effectively, and we like our positioning there. And on Medical, as Jeff said, it would be really hard to point to any meaningful competitive or operating performance difference between the last quarter and this quarter. Essentially the main change being the environment and, as Jeff said, the lapping of AssuraMed. So from a competitive positioning standpoint and where we are, actually feel pretty good about it. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. So maybe justify -- Jeff, just clarify what you said with respect to fiscal 4Q. It sounds like you are expecting another significant step-down in the profitability of the Pharmaceutical segment just basically to be in line with the midpoint of your guidance, but yet the biggest swing factors will be some uptick in terms of generic pricing and maybe the Q4 tax rate. So is it fair to say, embedded within your expectations for next quarter, you have continued very conservative assumptions with respect to generic pricing? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Absolutely, Glen. We do -- our current forecast implies another fairly significant sequential decline in benefit from manufacturer price increases on generics. Now as I said, though, we could be wrong on that, and that is the biggest swing factor in where we'll end up within the range. So I would second what you just said. I would also mention that we modeled it pretty accurately heading into Q3, but we're going to continue to be somewhat conservative on that point. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : It seems like your kind of execution in the China business continues to be a net positive for the overall company. I mean, as you sort of think about the growth trajectory there and what you've learned now being sort of a broader international business and your key partner on the JV continues to kind of search for assets in Brazil, I mean, how are you thinking about some of the rest of world opportunities? And obviously, your peers have gone into Europe. So how are you thinking about some of the emerging markets, the opportunities, as you've kind of seen what else is developed in some of these regions? George S. Barrett: So Ross, why don't I start, and then we'll let Jeff join me and probably some specific comments about China he might want to make. We've continued to look everywhere where we think there may be opportunity for us to explore competitive advantage. Remember that we do this really by business line. So obviously, the thing that gets the most attention, of course -- and we've seen major move in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business in Europe, for example, from our competitors. But for us, we'll look very carefully at every market, and we'll look at it with a pretty disciplined eye. And we'll look at it by our business lines. So again, we will -- we have a fair amount of experience in our senior team. We do sell a number of our products in the markets around the world. That's likely to expand. We're looking at individual markets really across the globe. But again, we'll do it with a very disciplined eye, with a goal of making sure that we can enhance our strategic positioning; that we've got a reason to compete, meaning, a reason to win; and that it serves [ph] our shareholders and other stakeholders well. So we're pretty active looking across the world. But again, you have to remind -- I think remind yourself that we have multiple lines of business, and we'll consider them both in the broad context and by line of business. I don't know if you want to add to that, Jeff? Jeffrey W. Henderson: The only thing I'd add is every news [ph] that's going into China, I think any time you make a move into an international country, you have to do it with a sense of purpose. And you can't dabble, honestly. Any international country requires a pretty significant management focus. And so any decision we make to enter additional countries has to be made with recognition of that, that it's going to take a fair amount of management time and attention, as it should. So if we are going to enter a country, it's going to be because, as George said, we can win. And that we're prepared to invest the necessary management time to being successful. And we could add value and deliver a good return for our shareholders. So none of those decisions will get made lightly. But we'll continue to look. And if we can find markets that can turn out to be as successful as China has been so far, that's great. And we'll apply our learnings from entering China into any significant future opportunities we find. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Not to be dense on this, the follow-up on the 3Q cadence. I know you guys referenced why revenue was a little bit down sequentially, and profit dollars, obviously, subsequently down as well. But if I look back historically 3Q in both segments is also your highest profit margin quarter. And I understand some of the timing issues you mentioned that would impact that. But for both segments, clearly, the operating profit margin is probably lower than what we have grown accustomed to in this particular quarter. Anything else worth calling out as far as mix or anything else within each segment that might have driven that? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Bob. First of all, I think it is important to remind everyone that this is -- Q3 was the second quarter we haven't had Walgreens, and that's going to continue through -- in terms of lapping that loss, it's going to continue through the first quarter of next year. I think we had such a strong quarter in Q2 that perhaps people lost sight of that. But we're still facing the drag on revenue and operating earnings year-on-year from that loss. I'll also say about Q3, actually, we're pretty pleased with where we ended up. We basically ended up exactly where we were forecasting to be. We overachieved versus plan. And yes, there was some lightness in utilization, particularly in Medical, that was a bit of a disappointment. But as George said earlier, from a competitive standpoint, from a strategic priority standpoint, we continue to be firing on almost all cylinders, which is important. And I think it bodes well for the future. So I -- quite frankly, from our perspective, Q3 came in as or slightly better than we expected, and we feel pretty good heading forward. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then I guess, Jeff, you mentioned some of the things to keep an eye on for next year ahead of official guidance, obviously. I just -- I guess, one specific question I had around contracts, can you remind us of your exposure to the DoD? Anything you'd call out there as far as how you're thinking about repricing that renewal? And then I guess, just along those lines, any other contracts that we should have on the radar as we think about modeling fiscal '15? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. So most of this, if not all of it, is public information, so I'll repeat what's in the public domain. Our total Pharma revenues, annual revenues from the DoD are about $600 million. We have 2 specific regions that we service the DoD. The contracts for both of those regions expire in our Q4 of next year. Now obviously, it's something we'll be very focused on during the next couple of months as the contracts come up for rebid, et cetera. But quite frankly, in terms of impact on FY '15, given the timing and given our overall exposure to the DoD, we expected it to have a fairly minimal impact on our fiscal '15. In terms of other contracts, Bob, I'm happy to say, actually, that if you look at our large pharma contracts, which is what I think you're referring to, we're really pretty well positioned through the end of fiscal '15 with all of our large customers. And as George alluded to, we're happy that we were able to extend the Kmart contract well into the future. And that's very important for a number of reasons, including the fact they're a fairly large generic buyer of us. So from a contract stability standpoint, we're probably better positioned now than we've been in some time. And obviously, you all know that the CVS distribution contract is extended for a number of years as well. So good overall stability. Operator : We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wonder if maybe you could just give us a little more color around the CVS JV go-live. For example, what portion of generics do you expect will purchase through the JV come July? Is this going to be rolled on over time, Jeff? George S. Barrett: So Lisa, I'll start, and then I'll let Jeff jump in. Again, you can assume that pretty much all of our generics are going to roll through that joint venture. There could be unique hospital lines that -- Injectables that are not. But you should assume that this is really going to be our generic sourcing model. And we can't provide too much detail beyond what I said in my comments, Lisa, except I will just say this : As Jeff said, we feel good and confident that we'll cover our financial obligations under the JV structure. We've made great progress. There are moving million -- 1 million moving parts in getting to the finish line, and the teams have been really working hard to get to that target date. The spirit of cooperation is incredibly good. And I think we're at a point where we're having good conversations with manufacturers. I think they appreciate that we're building up a pretty transparent model. And so from that standpoint, we're feeling good about it. I don't know, Jeff, if we can add much here. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Just to your -- when the sourcing sort of rolls into the JV, I would say that the JV will be responsible for virtually all generic sourcing from day 1. When I was referring to ramp up, I wasn't really referring to us gradually giving responsibility to the JV, because that does happen day 1. What I was referring to is really when the JV would be able to realize significant benefits in terms of repricing contracts, et cetera. That will ramp up over time, as you would expect, because it's not like we'd be able to redo every contract on day 1. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then you mentioned the renewal of Kmart and the fact that it's a large generic customer. I'm just curious, are you seeing any increased interest from other customers in your generic business now that you have this JV cooperative? George S. Barrett: Yes, Lisa, it's a great question. As you know, there's been -- these last 6 to 12 months have been a period of incredible amount of movement around the pharmaceutical industry. I would say there certainly is increased interest from players who might be at a smaller scale as to how they can best achieve a greater position. I can't go into great detail. But I think your hypothesis that this is likely is right on. And we'll continue to just be thoughtful and in touch with everyone who can be a player in this field. So yes, I think it's reasonable to say that there's continued and probably increasing interest. Operator : We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Partners. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Can you guys touch on what you're doing to work with your independent pharmacy customers to basically help them improve the way they deliver care? We're hearing a lot about how retail pharmacies are becoming more providers of care. Any thoughts around how you're helping them along that path? George S. Barrett: Yes, I'll touch on it. The model that we've evolved really with the independent pharmacy is essentially to provide an extraordinary amount of service support to them to enable them to do the thing that they're most likely to compete on effectively, which is getting out in front and engaging directly with the customers. And so our programs really cover the gamut from generic programs, obviously, reimbursement tools. I mentioned this, help on the CMS Star model. Just a little detail, that's really -- the way this works, CMS has implemented a rating system for all plans -- Medicare plans. And so the ratings come with bonus payments related to certain things. We're working with those customers to do that. We're helping them build centers for diabetics inside their stores. We are doing some programs for them that help fulfillment on the home care and dealing with patients who are elderly and have unique needs in their pharmacies. So I would say the basic concept is a huge wraparound kind of service system that allows them to operate in the most effective way they can in their community. Very specialized, very targeted. It's not a one-size-fits-all. And I think that's where we've gotten better in recent years, is that we've been able to really target these customers, segment them and understand that each of them has to compete differently in their own community. And I think the better we understand how they compete and what we can do to help them, the more effective we'll be. I think our retail business is showing the signs of that high service and high-touch model. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Great. And I'm also hearing about how hospital IDNs are obviously forming accountable care organization types of programs, and a lot of these are including pharmacies in their networks. Is that part of the it? George S. Barrett: Yes, it is, yes. Operator : We'll go next to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : So on the preferred products and the med-surg segment, Jeff, what percentage of gross profit would you say preferred products comprised of at this quarter? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, Greg. Great question, and obviously, something we watch very closely. It was about 36% of gross profit for the quarter. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And still, call it, 23-ish percent of med-surg revenues? Jeffrey W. Henderson: 22%, 23%, in that range. Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it, okay. And so with this acquisition, obviously you're planning on moving into other areas beyond interventional cardiology. But as you think about the contribution to -- from preferred products to that segment gross profit line. I mean, it would seem to me that over the coming years this is going to be -- this acquisition and just obviously layering on additional kind of high-end or high-tech-type devices will enable you to kind of basically transform the segment margin higher. And I just -- I guess, I was just kind of wondering, is this something that you view this acquisition and what you're going to do with it, as well as all of the other things that you're doing on the core business transformative to the segment gross profit margin? George S. Barrett: Yes, Greg, why don't I start and then, again, I'll turn it to Jeff. Yes, this is really at the heart of the strategy. This is, again, a place where we know it's a significant need for our customers. I think it's change of behavior that's going to really alter their game, not necessarily squeezing 1 more basis point out of some product. It's really about a change of behavior. Much of this requires standardization. And I think we're seeing an increasingly receptive customer to this. And we've started to make some moves to build out that platform. So in ortho, we had already begun to do that. You mentioned the high tech. I would say we've started really on the lower tech, which I think is the more appropriate place to start. The key for us is evidence-based equivalents. That's what we're focusing on. And building that case, starting in trauma. In cardio, we've really started with this acquisition. We wanted to make sure that we had a company with credibility, a product line that had some reach, a management team that we believed in, and actually, a relatively efficient low-cost service model, go-to-market model. And we believe that was AccessClosure. We get that. So this allows us, again, to think about other areas. For example, again, thinking more along the lower end of clinical differentiation, more like guide wires or catheters or diagnostic catheters that might be used in this setting. So again, the way to think about this is starting really on the lower end and making sure that we can build the support there in our community. Just to go back to ortho, I would also remind you that we are, I would say, pretty significantly ramping up our capability and the product line in our trauma area because, again, we started with a relatively thin line. And what's important is to be able to have a, really, a basket of products. So we do think that this has the potential to really change the game for our customers. And in terms of our own margin rate, should be very positive. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes, just to build on that margin rate question, Greg. As we said in our December Investor Day, our goal is to achieve a Medical segment profit margin rate of at least 5.75% by fiscal '17. And there's really 3 things that are going to drive it, and one of those things is not getting paid more for core distribution. That's not our expectation. But we do believe that the things that we can wrap around our supply chain capabilities will be key drivers of that margin expansion. And specifically, that's preferred products. And as we said at the time, our goal is to get the gross margin contribution from preferred products to about 45% of the overall Medical segment gross margin. Secondly, continuing to aggressively build our home health platform. And thirdly, layering on additional services that we can provide to the hospitals that are clearly very high margin. So it's really those 3 initiatives that are going to drive our margin expansion over the next 3 [ph] of years. George S. Barrett: Sorry, again, just to reinforce because it's important. We really are focused on a particular part of the market, and these are really, at the moment, it's areas where clinical differentiation is not really relevant, not -- and then where standardization, the benefits of standardization would be really compelling. So just wanted to make sure I highlight that. Operator : We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : George, I wanted to kind of -- I want to pick on your expertise here. And I want to ask, from your background, how much variance is there in the contracting between the drug wholesalers and the generic drug manufacturers? Because with the new purchasing entities that have been formed by some of your peers, it seems like there's a lot of new bells and whistles that trying to be introduced to how the contracts are structured between the manufacturers and the wholesalers. So I guess I would ask, are you guys seeing more bells and whistles being introduced? And George, I guess, from your time at Teva, can you talk about how much variance there was in the contracts between different types of wholesalers, different types of customers? George S. Barrett: Yes. So George, great questions. Part of which I can answer, part of which I can't. So in terms of differential on pricing, that's just not something I can speak to at this point. I think you guys have to use your own judgment as to how you would believe a different size and scale might influence how pricing is delivered from manufacturer to the channel. Obviously, we --- there's enormous amount of work we've done in this internally, but not something we can really share. In terms of the bells and whistles question, it's a really interesting one. I would argue this, that having sat in the manufacturer's seat, you want this system to be pretty simple. And so, in fact, attaching too many bells and whistles is not necessarily where we want to go. I think we want to simplify the relationship with the manufacturer. I think we want to have a great line of sight between them and us. I think we need to be able to demonstrate to them that we can create value for them. That certainly is market share and our ability to influence market share. But it's also having a model that they connect to and that works for them. So yes, I would say we're not trying to attach things to the model. We're actually trying to simplify in many ways and make sure that when we go to the market as a single joint venture, it's very straightforward, very clear, very transparent, they know who they're working with. I don't know if that's helpful. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes. It is helpful, I guess, from the entity perspective. But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, how should we think out about the procurement savings that you and CVS are going to achieve? We're dumb sell-siders. We think about this in terms of dead [ph] net price reductions versus will there be rebate structures, GPO structures, GPO fee -- or GPO admin fees, pay-to-play structures. So that's -- I mean, that's the type of complexity that I'm talking about, and we're just hearing about lots of interesting structures that are being examined. I'm trying to figure out how much of this is new and how much of this is normal. George S. Barrett: So historically, there have been multiple -- very quick context, there have been multiple ways that companies deal with the generic manufacturers. Again, let me be very clear, though. We want to keep it simple. So our goal is going to -- is really going to be to do that, not to add layers of complexity. What I can't give you, and I think was the beginning part of your question and I simply can't do that, is how much value is there coming from the venture. And the only thing we can share with you at this point is what we've shared when we announced, which is that we've got an obligation under the joint venture agreement. We feel positive that we'll cover those obligations. And that we expect this to be accretive. But again, transparency, simplicity is probably going to be more of the order of the day in our model rather than adding layers of complexity. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And last one I'll hop off with -- is can you update us on generic drug private label strategy? George S. Barrett: I'm sorry? George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Generic drug private label strategy? George S. Barrett: Yes, let me try to do this very generally. To me, in the U.S. market, again, let's talk about the U.S. market. And that's primarily today where we're competing in generic drugs. We don't really believe that the label, whether or not it will be for private label, is a relevant dynamic for those that are making the purchasing decisions. So other companies may choose to go down that path, and we totally respect that and understand it. And maybe it's part of a procurement strategy. And to that extent, we'd always evaluate those things, so we don't rule them out. But as a commercial downstream market strategy, we don't believe in the U.S -- and this has been tried over the last 40 years -- in the U.S., we don't think that's a particularly relevant thing. But certainly, as part of our procurement strategy, if we thought that helped us in that part of the business, we're always open to it and never rule it out. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I missed a couple of your comments on the generic inflation stuff. I know last quarter, you characterized it still as abnormally high inflation on a relatively small basket of products. I guess my question is just big picture, where do we stand on resolution of supply shortage situations? Big picture, are we seeing those circumstances starting to dissipate a little bit? Are we seeing an increase in shortages? Just want to get a sort of a big picture comment on that. George S. Barrett: Yes. Sure, Steve. I'll start this, and again, Jeff is always free to pile in here. We've said pretty much through the early part of the year that we thought we were seeing some relatively unusual pricing patterns, if you can even use the word patterns. Obviously, these tend to be individual markets. I always remind people that thousands of generic drugs, it's thousands of individual markets. We have -- we did expect to see some moderation during the second half of the year. And then that's what we saw in Q2, we were not far off our expectation on that. So I think the question about what's happening in the market and the disturbances, I'm not sure that we've seen a lot of change there. There continue to be disturbances in the market, significant disturbances in the injectable space, in the hospital space, as you know. And that has made it very complicated for the system. And I know that there a number of both policymakers and a lot of the companies trying to figure out how best to navigate that environment. But I would say we've continued to see some manufacturer shortages. And I'm not sure that has materially changed. But it moves from product to product, as you probably know. Jeffrey W. Henderson: The only other color I'll add, Steve, is that the number of products that actually had an increase in Q3 sequentially was slightly higher than what we saw in Q2, although still under 5% of our portfolio. However, as I said earlier, that the net benefit to us from price increases in Q3 was materially lower than Q2. Operator : We'll take our final question from Garen Sarafian with Citi. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a follow-up question regarding your joint venture and just the ramp-up. I'm wondering, how does the progression of the ramp occur? I'm just trying to figure out why wouldn't -- especially if the model is to keep it simple, if it would hit its run rate by the end of your fiscal year next year, so within a 12-month period? Or is there something -- inherently something that's longer term such as contracts that you can't get out of that require a 3-year period or something? So if you could just elaborate on that a little bit would be helpful. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. Thanks, Gary. Good question. What I've said before, which we still believe to be the case, is fiscal '15 will be a ramp-up period and that's because it will take time to renegotiate new contracts. We also have some contracts that still have to play out in fiscal '15 -- existing contracts, I'm referring to. That all said, we do expect that we'll hit probably a more normalized run rate in fiscal '16. I don't think we're looking at a multi-year ramp-up period. But again, just to repeat, probably '15 will be a ramp-up period and '16 will be more of a normalized run rate. Operator : I'd like to turn it back to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett: Okay, great. Thank you. Look, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on today's call and for your questions and your interest in Cardinal Health. And we look forward to seeing you at upcoming meetings. Thanks, all. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

And welcome to the Cardinal Health Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sally Curley : Thank you, Tina, and welcome to Cardinal Health's fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings and fiscal 2015 guidance call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation, found on the Investor page of our website for a description of those risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures is included at the end of the slides. Our press release and details about upcoming events can be found on the IR section of our website at cardinalhealth.com. So please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. George Barrett. George? George Barrett : Thanks, Sally. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Fiscal 2014 was an enormously important year for Cardinal Health. Our organization exceeded our financial goals for the year, along multiple dimensions : revenue, gross margin dollars, non-GAAP operating earnings, and operating margin rate, and cash flow. A particular note, we were able to absorb a revenue headwind of nearly $17 billion, due to the FY 2014 first quarter expiration of the Walgreens contract and still grow our non-GAAP earnings over the prior year. At the same time, we have been able to enhance our market position, deploy capital efficiently, and continue to grow the talent so critical to our future. Equally important, we began our fiscal 2015 stronger and better position than ever to address the needs of a healthcare system looking for solution to two very basic questions. How do we deliver better care more cost effectively? And who are those industry players who listen and act to bring innovative solutions to the table? Answering these questions is at the heart of what we do and our teams approach is recognizing that we need to compete and win every day in today's marketplace, while at the same time making the important moves to adapt to a changing healthcare environment. We could make a strong argument that this has been a transition year for the industry as well. It's been an extraordinary 12 months in healthcare, particularly here in the U.S. Last fall, we saw the first rollout of the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. And throughout the year our system continued to explore different models for providing coverage for patients, delivering care, and managing cost. We saw consumers playing a more active role in their own healthcare, much of this fueled by the impact of changing benefit design, and we saw some medical breakthroughs that expanded our systems capacity to manage and even cure disease, but also test our abilities co-readiness to take with that innovation. At the same time, with such clear signs of an industry actively repositioning and consolidating upstream, among pharmaceuticals and MedTech manufacturers, as well as among providers and health system, and a continued learning of the lines that delineated, which used to be the distinct segment of the healthcare market. This is truly been a year of transition. With that as context, let me talk about our performance in FY 2014. My remarks will focus broadly on our annual fiscal 2014 and our 2015 outlook. As I mentioned in our opening remarks, fiscal year 2014 required some major transitions for Cardinal Health, after the expiration of the Walgreens contract. And given this headwind, I am particularly pleased with our results. Our revenues for the year, excluding Walgreens, grew by 8% fueled primarily by strong growth from existing customers. Our reported revenues, including the impact from Walgreens for the year, declined by 10% to $91 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings rose 4% to $2.1 billion, while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.84, up 3%, and our gross margin rate expanded by 80 basis points to 5.7% for the year. Our team continued to drive capital efficiency this year, generating $2.5 billion in cash from operation. We returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2014, through both our strong dividend and share buybacks. And I'm very pleased that we were able to provide our investors with a total shareholder return of 46.7% per year. Now let me turn to the segment. Our Pharmaceutical segment more than met the challenge associated with the Walgreens contract expiration, actually delivering a profit increase, while absorbing net $17 billion revenue headwind. It's worth noting that the rate of revenue growth excluding Walgreens would have been a robust 8% for our Pharmaceutical segment. Our overall Pharmaceutical segment profit margin expanded almost 30 basis points for the year. I would like to take a few minutes to cover a few strategic priority areas for our Pharma segment. There is little doubt that generic drug will continue to be a significant lever in holding down prescription drug cost. Track data suggests that generics now represent over 85% of our prescriptions in United States. We have significantly increased our scale in generics through our various internal and external moves, most notably our joint venture with CVS Caremark, now named Red Oak Sourcing. A few quick comments about Red Oak. We are extremely excited about our progress to-date in getting to a go-live with Red Oak, which was formalized last month. And CVS Caremark has been a perfect partner throughout the process. As we work through the details in our preparation for the launch, our enthusiasm has only increased. We have assembled a talented team with both Cardinal Health and CVS Caremark well represented. Our teams are putting the hard work to manage through all of the intricate detail so that we could go to the manufactures with one face and as one decision maker. We feel confident that our participation in Red Oak will ensure that Cardinal Health is in the best position to serve our diverse mix of customers in this competitive landscape. I understand that many of you will want to know more details about the impact, the value, and mechanics of the joint venture, but I'll ask you to recognize that Red Oak has only just this past month been engaging in discussions with manufacturers. It is important to respect the process and for us to let these negotiations proceed between Red Oak and the manufactures. And so other than the comments Jeff will be making, we will not provide specifics in the mechanics or the exact value derived from the joint venture. Of course, FY 2015 guidance include the assumption associated with the net benefits from Red Oak. You know that diversifying our customer base has been a priority. We've continued to grow our position with independent pharmacies and other pharmacy channels over the year. Our portfolio of solutions for these customers has never been more comprehensive and the response of the retailers has never been more enthusiastic. I just returned from RBC, our Annual Retail Business Conference held in Washington DC last week. The gathering of thousands of owners and pharmacists was our largest ever, reinforcing their importance to the healthcare system and the Cardinal Health. The conference gave these retailers exposure to over 60 continuing education courses and provided access to latest tools, technologies, solutions, and innovative generic program. Special emphasis was placed on patient solutions that helped with medication adherence and medication therapy management. Our focus remains to help these critical members of the healthcare system improve patient care, the breadth of their products and services, and the efficiency and profitability of their businesses. At the same time, our ability to serve hospitals and health systems with pharmaceutical products continues to strengthen, including some of the important work we are doing with our clinical pharmacy teams to help with discharge management. Specialty medicine and the services surrounding these innovations continues to play an increasingly large role in our healthcare landscape and of course, for Cardinal Health. During fiscal 2014, we are able to deliver a 30% revenue growth in the Specialty Solutions group. We have expanded our presence in specialty biopharmaceutical, particularly in building at our tools to interface with patients who need to be served in an integrated and high-touch model. This enables us to serve the providers up here to these unique patient population and also to capture value as a partner to biopharmaceutical companies who seek to get closer to the patient. Support this program; we established our best-in-class patient-centric hub with the acquisition of Sonexus Health in the third quarter of FY 2014. This platform and experienced team is an important step to position Cardinal Health to assist in these efforts and to deliver value added services. Moving to the Medical segment. Fiscal 2014 revenues grew 9%. Margin rate expanded by 35 basis points and segment profit grew at almost 20%. The delivery of medical care has been undergoing fairly rapid change and the work of our medical segment has been focused on aligning to address the evolution in the system. Just these past few weeks we formalized some adaptation to these changes launching a team based approach to addressing the needs of large integrated delivery networks. These are not sales teams but rather business and systems experts, who are charged with delivering the full range and breadth of the Cardinal Health portfolio to address the complex needs of these diverse customers. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen consolidation among hospital systems, continued affiliation between doctors and those systems, and some shifting stand as it relates to where care is delivered. On this last point, well the sickest, sickest patients will continue to be served in acute care setting. It's clear that many patients with lower acuity will be served in different settings, whether that's a community hospital, surgery center, a clinic, a physician's office, or even the home. This has been at the heart of our strategy to serve patients across the continuum of care. In this context, the acquisition of AssuraMed, a year ago, has been an important extension of our strategy. It has significantly increased our touch points and created opportunities in a market that is growing and estimated 5% to 7% per year. Most important for Cardinal Health, it's increasing our direct linkages with chronic patients. Through AssuraMed, we have some form of interaction with the patient, 44,000 times a day. With this increasing patient interaction, we recently made the decision to rebrand our AssuraMed platform as Cardinal Health to Home -- excuse me, Cardinal Health At Home. As we told you at the time of the acquisition, we intended to increase the AssuraMed portfolio. We have in fact broadened the product line, as well as increased the number of Cardinal Health branded products to this important channel of the home. Although, we are extremely pleased with the progress here and the fact that AssuraMed exceeded our full year accretion target of $0.18 per share. Our medical consumables business has represented an opportunity to use our scale to bring significant savings to the healthcare system, while at the same time expanding our margin. Our consumable business grew faster than the market this year driven by share gains from new private label product launches, new channel penetration, and from growth among our strategic accounts. We saw full year sales growth of 6% and launched over 500 new SKUs during FY 2014. During this past year, we discussed with you the challenges many of our hospitals, IDN, and surgery centre customer faced in managing physician preference items. These categories tend to consume resources and from our perspective represent an inefficiency. We've recognized an opportunity to bring standardization and with that real time value to this system. We position ourselves to address some critical pain points, building platforms in orthopedic, wound management, and with our third quarter acquisition of AccessClosure interventional cardiovascular. A few comments on China. China has continued to be an outstanding growth story for us. In 2014 we grew revenues by 30% reaching $2.6 billion. We continue to build strong relationship with our pharma and medical device company, at a time where company reputation is particularly important. We have expanded our geographic footprint and our lines of business which now include 30 direct-to-patient pharmacies focused on specialized pharmaceutical product. Before I turn to 2015 one more note, it's been our practice to be transparent with you with regard to areas where we need to be better. This was a year of enormous accomplishment. But we had a few areas that did not satisfy our high expectations. Fortunately these are relatively small parts of our portfolio and in each case we are taking action to accelerate improvement but I do want to call them out. Canada was a particularly tough market for medical supplies this year, and our business declined there year-over-year. We believe that we've made the necessary moves to address the pressure to that market and we look forward to recovery in that business. Our work supplying medical products to small physician offices has not had the growth that we like to see. While we had solid performance in most post-acute settings, including surgery centers, and large practices, we are committed to making greater progress within these smaller practices and are taking steps accordingly. As we leave 2014, and turn to our fiscal 2015, we begin the year with increased scale and generic, a more robust specialty business, a reconfigured customer and product portfolio, and some important solution offering for the medical system. The flexibility that comes with financial strength, a deep bench of organizational talent, and a sense of confidence in the future. Most importantly, we believe our strategic priorities align with the needs of a system experiencing a rapid change. New performance based model, and a world of bundled risk, changing network design, accountable care organization and a more involved patient acting more like a consumer. So with this as backdrop, we are guiding to a fiscal year 2015 non-GAAP EPS range of $4.10 to $4.30. This puts on track to deliver on the long-term aspiration we laid out in our December Investor Day. It's our year-end so I would like to voice a few thank you. To our shareholders, we appreciate your support and your high expectations. For business partners, manufacturers, providers, and caregivers, those who directly touch patients, we thank you for putting your trust in us, and allowing us to help you serve your patients. To all my colleagues at Cardinal Health, my gratitude for your talent, and your spirit, and your readiness to respond to important challenges, and to do so, with your eyes always on the patient. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to make a few quick comments on our announcement about his retirement, which will become effective following the end of our fiscal 2015. Jeff has been a talented and trusted partner to me since my arrival at Cardinal Health. I have often leaned on his agile mind and his quick wit. Although there will be no Derek Jeter farewell tour, we have a healthy transition scheduled and I know all of you will get a time with Jeff to thank him in the coming year. And of course, we will update you as we formalize our succession plan. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Henderson : Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. And by the way I'm counting on Derek Jeter farewell tour, okay. But thank you for the comments. I'm happy reporting a solid finish to an important transition year. This morning I will begin by highlighting key financial trends and drivers of our fourth quarter results and then make a few comments on our full year performance. I will provide additional detail on our fiscal 2015 guidance, including some of our key expectations and underlying assumptions. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. As we indicated during our third quarter call, achieving the upper end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range would really depend on two items : the impact resulting from generic manufacturer price increases, and our tax rate. During the quarter we grew our non-GAAP EPS by 5% to $0.83 per share, or $3.84 for the full year a reflection of a relatively favorable outcome for both these factors. Again some more detail in a moment. Now let's review the rest of the income statement, starting with revenue. Consolidated revenue came in better than expected, down 10% to $22.9 billion, was a decline due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Gross margin dollars were up slightly for the quarter, resulting in a gross margin rate 58 basis points higher than the prior year's Q4. This continues a 16-quarter trend of gross margin rate expansion. SG&A expenses moderately increased by 2.5% in Q4, driven by recent acquisitions and year-over-year competition related items. Our core SG&A costs were slightly favorable to last year, due to our continuous focus on operational efficiencies. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 16 basis points to over 2%. Net interest and other expenses was favorable in the fourth quarter versus prior year due in part to lower interest expense. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was about 34% versus the prior year's 37%. This period lower rate is related to favorable state tax outcomes in the quarter. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted average shares are outstanding was $343 million nearly $2 million favorable to last year's period. During the quarter we purchased about $285 million worth of shares bringing the full year repurchase to $673 million. We have over $700 million remaining on our board authorized repurchase program. Moving on to consolidated cash flows and the balance sheet. Our operations generated $715 million in cash flow during the quarter. This brings the full year to approximately $2.5 billion, include the expected benefit of more than $500 million from the unwind of the Walgreens business. We continue to make good progress in reducing our overall networking capital base, which are down 1.8 days largely related to a shift in customer mix. Overall we ended Q4 with strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of $2.9 billion, with $420 million held internationally. Now let's move to segment performance starting with Pharma. Pharma segment revenue decreased 12% to $20.1 billion, driven by the continued impact of the expiration of the Walgreens contract. The decline was partially offset by organic sales growth especially in China. The contribution of revenue from Walgreens in the prior years was approximately $5 billion for the quarter. If you adjust for that contract loss, our Pharma sales growth in Q4 was a strong 13% driven by both pricing and volume effects. Specialty Solution have revenue growth of 21% versus the same period last year. Our China business also contributed to Pharma revenue growth. Total China sales were up 24% versus the prior period. This was driven primarily by a local distribution business from both organic growth and as a result of our strategic geographic expansion. Pharma segment profit decreased by 5% to $377 million, primarily driven by the continued impact of the Walgreens contract termination, which was partially offset by strong performance in our generic programs. On the topic of generics, I do want to mention that we saw a sequential quarter increase in contribution from generic manufacturer price increases, although it was not to the level we experienced in our second quarter. Manufacturer price increases continued to impact a relatively small basket of generic items. The overall generic portfolio experienced net inflation in the low-single-digits in the quarter. Very importantly, our generic program saw strong sales growth of about 9%, more favorably driven by strong double-digit growth in our stores program. We also saw continued brand inflation in the low-double-digits, about as we expected. Pharma segment profit marginal rate increased by 14 basis points compared to the prior year's Q4, a reflection of the strength of our generic programs and our continued focus on margin expansion. Moving on to the Medical segment performance in the quarter. Medical revenue grew 4% in the fourth quarter versus last year driven by growth of existing customers, including solid growth in our strategic hospital network accounts, and the benefit of acquisitions. Regarding our strategic hospital accounts, we saw low-to-mid-single-digit growth in this key customer category in both Q4 and the full year. This represents great work on the part of our medical team, given the continued challenging utilization environment. We expect more of the same in 2015 and beyond. Medical segment profit declined 8% which includes two items worth a combined negative $13 million year-on-year. First of these was a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation, the majority of which is based on total company performance that's been allocated to the segments. Secondly, we also had some performance shortfalls in our Medical business in Canada, which as George mentioned, reflected substantial market pressures related to Medical spend. Excluding these two items, Medical segment profits would have shown solid growth. Turning to Slide number 8, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. A $0.50 variance in non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which reduced our GAAP results by $0.12 per share. In Q4 of last year GAAP results was $2.51 lower than non-GAAP results, predominantly due to an impairment charge associated with our nuclear division. Now let me add a few additional comments on the full year. Fiscal 2014 non-GAAP operating earnings were up 4%. I am particularly pleased with our excellent progress in margin expansion with both the gross margin rate, and the non-GAAP operating margin rate increasing versus last year, up 80 basis points and 32 basis points respectively. This is solid performance in a transition year and is a testament to our organization's flexibility, adaptability, and commitment to growth. Fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS was $3.84, up 3% versus last year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share included a discrete positive $0.18 per share benefit from the tax settlement. In fiscal 2014, our non-GAAP earnings per share included a net $0.02 per share benefit from two large offsetting tax items. Excluding these items in both years, the company achieved non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 8%. For the year, Pharma segment revenues declined 12%, but were better than expected as organic customer growth exceeded our original expectations. Full year Pharma segment profits increased over the prior year and the margin rate expanded 27 basis points to 2.18%. Our Medical segment achieved strong year-over-year growth with revenues up 9% and segment profit growth of nearly 20%, including the impact of AssuraMed. In addition, Medical reported segment profit margin rate improvement up 35 basis points to 4.05%. Very importantly, during the year we also made excellent progress against all strategic priorities, which George in some detail on his remarks. We are also returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. When I look at our entire fiscal 2014, I am extraordinarily proud of the growth and overall performance we were able to achieve given the headwind we are facing from the considerable shift in our customer base. With a strong 2014 behind us, I would say we are well positioned heading into a new fiscal year. Before discussing our fiscal 2015 outlook, I want to mention a change in the way we are providing guidance and reporting results going forward. As noted in the release we have redefined our non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude LIFO credits or charges. This change in our non-GAAP definition comes after conducting research on comparable healthcare companies and deciding to simplify comparisons of our results versus other peer companies. We felt that doing this now, when we do not have a LIFO charge in FY 2014, and do not expect one in fiscal 2015 made the most sense. As George stated, for fiscal 2015, we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 and we expect revenues will increase modestly. I will now walk through our other corporate assumptions for the year. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be approximately $337 million to $338 million which implies that we intent to repurchase well over $500 million worth of shares during the year. We expect net interest and other expense of $140 million to $150 million. As a reminder, our fiscal 2014 benefit of over $30 million related to gains of minority investments is not expected to repeat. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures of about $350 million with the bulk of that spending on our strategic priorities and IT investments. This amount is higher than historical averages, as we focus on updating our information systems within the Pharmaceutical segment, adding incremental manufacturing and 3PL capacity in certain areas, and continuing to build our footprint in China. We also expect amortization of intangible related assets to prior acquisitions to be approximately $177 million or about $0.33 per share. We are projecting an overall non-GAAP tax rate in a range of 36% to 37%. This tax rates reflect our expectations of further discussions and potential settlements of outstanding audit periods, as well as a benefit of our tax planning effort. Let me comment on a few segment specific assumptions. In Pharma, we are expecting a modest increase in revenues versus prior year. As a reminder, the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration will not last until September. We still have a negative impact of two full months or about $3 billion in revenue and the fact that we have full quarter of earnings. As we noted on our first quarter call, given the nature of the wind down of the Walgreens contract, the expiration did not significantly impact our operating earnings in Q1 of FY 2014 compared to the prior year period. With respect to other key retail customer contracts, all now extend beyond our fiscal 2015. We are planning for the brand inflation rate to be similar to fiscal 2014. Generic programs overall are expected to contribute positively to year-over-year profits. Included in this expectation are a number of underlying assumptions. First we forecast a slight year-over-year decline in the benefit of new generic launches. Also we have modeled moderation in generic manufacturer price increases with less impact in fiscal 2015 than we experienced in fiscal 2014. Remember that the frequency and magnitude of these generic price increases are uncertain and difficult to predict. Across the overall generic portfolio our guidance range assumes slightly deflation versus fiscal 2014 which is a fairly typical pattern. Also included in our expectations for performance under generic programs is benefit resulting from the formation of Red Oak Sourcing, net of our payments with CVS Caremark. As George mentioned in his remarks, we are pleased with the work we are able to accomplish with our partners CVS, creating a mutually beneficial long-term joint venture. As we work together to get this venture up and running over the six months that are left, since the announcement of the deal, we further refine certain aspects of our agreement. I would like to cover those briefly. First, the initial payment of CVS is delayed in to our fiscal 2015 second quarter reflecting the operational ramp up associated with this venture. To be clear the total amount of our fixed payment from Cardinal Health to CVS over the life of the 10-year agreement remains the same. This is simply a slight timing shift. The actual quarterly fixed amount will be $25.6 million spread over 39 quarters instead of 40. This fixed payment of $25.6 million will be expensed evenly on a monthly basis, beginning with a realization of meaningful benefits from this JV. With the operational ramp up, we have modeled minimal net benefit from the JV in our first quarter of 2015. We expect during the course of the fiscal year that the value to us will ramp. The payment expense will be reported in our cost of goods sold. Second, if certain milestones were achieved, we will make additional predetermined quarterly payments to CVS beginning in our fiscal 2016. Reflects the long-term nature of the deal and is designed to align incentives. Again, all assumed benefits and expected payments are included in our fiscal 2015 guidance and longer-term goals. We are very pleased that we are able to get this joint venture up and running in early July as we have planned. And we look forward to our continued partnership with CVS and the opportunity to grow the strategic relationship. Finally, to conclude our Pharmaceutical segment assumption, we expect continued growth in our specialty and China division, as well as increased investment in information systems within the segment. Looking to our Medical segment, we are planning for low-to-mid-single-digit revenue growth. We also anticipate continuous segment profit growth and margin expansion, primarily due to contribution to my strategic priorities in the second half of the fiscal year. Our preferred products strategy will continue to develop as we move through the fiscal year. As we discussed before, preferred products are expected to be a contributor over the midterm as we expand our portfolio, particularly in the physician preference area. Additionally, we continue to expect market growth -- sorry. Additional, we continue to expect above market growth from Cardinal Health At Home, which is a new branding we have rolled out for AssuraMed platform. As our Medical segment performance ramps over fiscal 2015, we expect a relatively flat utilization environment in the acute settings and mid-single-digit growth in the home setting. As always, we will keep our operations lean and use our flexible model to capture any upside related utilization should it appear. Finally, when we net together our assumptions for a slight headwind from commodities with a positive impact from foreign exchange, these net assumptions essential neutral on a year-over-year basis. Before I leave guidance, I want to add a few comments related to the first quarter of 2015. Typically we don't quarterly guidance but I do want to point out a few unique issues, which will likely make Q1 our toughest quarter on both an absolute earnings basis and year-on-year growth. From a compare standpoint, keep in mind the last year's first quarter adversely a full quarter of earnings from Walgreens and a beneficial tax settlement of $0.18. And again, we have not modeled net benefit from the JV in or fiscal 2015 Q1 but expect that during the course of year the value to us will ramp. And we will be investing to win in certain areas, including the ramp up of our physician preference platforms and our IT upgrades in the Pharma business. With that, let me move on to my final remarks. On the whole, I am very proud of what we are able to accomplish this year. At the beginning of fiscal 2014, we faced sizeable challenges. And I could to be more proud that work of our teams resulted in a positive outcomes we are reporting today. As we look forward, we have the fundamental positioning, a strategic alignment to make excellent progress against our long-term goals of margin expansion, earnings growth, and returns to shareholders. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). At this time, we'll take our first question from Ross Muken, ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group : So on the generic inflation front, it seems just in general it's something that is incrementally hard to forecast just because of some of these one-off portfolio that you've talked about. In terms of getting the buying organization kind of amenable to may be trying to pre-buy where there is opportunities or where you see in a certain category, how do you foresee sort of your ability to kind of change the way you've been doing business to basically try to capture more of this? Or -- so basically, what I'm asking is, it's hard to forecast but if you could see it in a category it's obviously quite profitable. I guess, if I doesn't go into the guidance because it's tough to predict. But how are you sort of working with everyone to kind of make sure you are able to modify this? And then, how does that also change the way and then you deal with CVS on things like this? George Barrett : Ross, this is George, good morning, and thanks for the question so little hard to answer this. Partly as I said during my prepared comments, we are literally just this past month beginning negotiations. Let's start with some basics. You're right it is difficult to model price increases. We have talked a little bit about this in the past, which is -- well, it's difficult to sort of model the products. We think about the environment and what are the conditions like. And so as we start thinking about our year, well we can't model each product necessarily perfectly. We start thinking about how -- what are the conditions that lead to this, whether or not that is intense regulatory environment or various market disruption. Here's what I would say, we have an incredibly sophisticated team and I would say now team put together, when we look at Red Oak to evaluate the market and to build into our modeling all the assumptions around price and price increases. I think we've done a recently good job of doing that. We do what we can and we build that into our forecast. So if you look at our FY 2015 guidance it includes some assumptions about way products go through and how they are priced. But again, it's really hard for me to say too much about this and that we're just beginning these discussions with manufactures. But I will say that I couldn't be more excited about the quality and the know-how and the experience of the teams that have been put together to do this kind of work. Ross Muken - ISI Group : All right, George that was a much better answer than my question was. May be just turning to the Medical side of things that you guys have been pushing more on the preferred product side obviously with AccessClosure that gets deeper into cardio, you have done stuff in ortho. I think wound care make sense in a market. I mean, what's the response you're getting incrementally if you guys continue to move forward with the strategy? And where are you seeing the most openness and where are you seeing sort of the most pushback at the hospital level? George Barrett : I think in general, we are seeing a tremendous responsiveness. And I would say it's pretty consistently across the board at this point. Again, hospital systems are really facing different kinds of changes, including reimbursement models that look different. And so they're looking carefully not just about how they squeeze cost but how they change behaviors. This is really a behavior change where they begin to think about forcing more standardization on the commodity types of products that are in their medical service category, excuse me medical products category. And I think our conversations have been really encouraging. I've been involved in some of those myself. Yes, we've said along this is sort of a mid-term driver because this is a change of behavior. But we are really excited about the response and we are excited about the build-out of our program not just with the step-in interventional cardiology but little bit of the growth of the platform that we guided in, in ortho and our movement into wound care. So we are really excited about it and we are getting a very positive response. But again, it's I would say more a little bit of a mid-term driver as we think about the way this will ramp. Operator : Our next question from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Lisa Gill - JP Morgan : Thanks very much. And good morning. George, kind of start with this quarter and just may be if we can talk about the revenue growth. Revenue growth is coming in substantially better than our expectation. Could you speak anything on the specialty side, some of your competitors called out Hep C or do you think we're seeing the beginning stages of the Affordable Care Act? George Barrett : Hi. Good morning Lisa. It's interesting question. We'll start with the Hep C first. I would say that the Hep C products did have some impact on revenues, although I would say was not that meaningful and a less effect on margins. So I wouldn't say it was a major driver of our business. What we are seeing I think -- first of all, again the balance of our portfolio of customers is improving. We are getting great response. We have seen some important growth in our strategic accounts meaning, I think we're identifying the right customers who really are positioned to compete in a changing environment. So I think in general, when I look at execution, we managed it pretty rigorously. We are executing on our things that we're supposed to be doing with our customers and I just think in general we've seen good performance on a revenue basis across the business. Specialty again, you mentioned specifically, just a reminder the two FC drugs are going really primarily through traditional distribution channel so they are unique drugs obviously in many ways. They are drug patient populations with very special needs. But these are solids and are moving through the traditional drug channel rather than with specialty. Our specialty growth is really not been about that; it's been about organic growth, picking up new accounts, and adding to our service package. Lisa Gill - JP Morgan : And then my second question would just be med-surg Canada. Jeff called this out specifically as an area -- or you've called that out as an area that didn't meet your expectations. Can you just go into a little more detail as to what's going on in that market right now? Is it a reimbursement issue? How do we think about med-surg in Canada? George Barrett : I'm going to let Jeff touch on it. Jeff Henderson : Lisa, I'll take it. This is my home country. We have seen some pressures in the hospital market in Canada and primarily related to reimbursement pressures on hospitals due to government funding changes. So there have been generally low utilization and pressures on pricing over the past 6 to 12 months. And as George said, we are taking the necessary steps to address those performance shortfalls, both organizationally from a portfolio standpoint and from a cost standpoint and we're being very encouraged given strength of our Canadian business over the medium-term we will see that business get back on the right track. Operator : And our next question from Eric Percher of Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays: Thank you. A question on capital allocation. Appreciate the detail around repurchase and IT investment. So as you think back over the last year with investments in specialty and med-surg, do you think we're seeing a natural balance? I know you have more cash that you can put to use than just what you're generating. Where do you think the opportunities are? George Barrett : Well, Eric good morning we have identified a number of areas that we've been public about that are high priority areas for us and obviously we're doing everything we can in every one of those strategic areas to improve our strategic positioning and to be in a position to win. Where we can deploy capital against them we will. So we've done some obviously major work in generic this year, specialty has been a target, our consumables and physician preference item area has been an area of priority for us. Obviously we look at diversified customer base; the home continues to be an area of real interest for us you think about again the continuum of care. And then, of course China has been our main priority in terms of our international expansion because we've seen so much opportunity. We will continue to look globally to see whether or not the opportunities that really enhance our long-term positioning. Jeff, if you want to add anything to it. Jeff Henderson : From a external standpoint with respect to shareholder return obviously we remain very committed to our dividend as demonstrated by our Board's recent decision to increase the dividend by a further 13% heading into this year. And as we said, consistently for the past several years, we will look at share repo opportunistically and from a flexible standpoint to look for opportunities to buy back shares and enhance shareholder returns again as we did in 2014 and as we have modeled for 2015 as well. Eric Percher - Barclays: And as you think about specialty, it feels like you've tried to stay away from the lower-margin areas and build the services piece. Do you feel like there's more to be built there? Or do the acquisitions you made this year position you to grow organically? George Barrett : Well I think there is more opportunity there. Again if you think about what's happening in the Pharmaceutical side and the R&D side and the need both of these unique patient population, the physicians who are serving them in biopharmaceutical companies, I think there is a real opportunity there, and so we will continue to look organically how we build out our programs. We've got some really exciting work that we can do on the technology side internally. But if we see something externally that adds to our positioning we're certainly going to be open to it. Operator : And our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company : Thanks, guys. George, Jeff, just moving back to Medical for a second, we always talk about Canada. What about on the alternate side? You talked about the small physician practice needing some work. Can you talk about; is this an issue of scale? Is this an area where you think you need to invest more, maybe build more assets here? May be talk about that area. George Barrett : Good morning, Charles thanks. So I think when we talk about the small physician office obviously we started from a small base, so certainly scale has helped. But I would also say this -- that our physical operational footprint, if you look at the way we are designed over many years, so really more tuned to larger type customers. So we've had to do some repositioning of our facilities and that sort of touch points with those smaller accounts. It's just a little bit of more like a -- almost like a B2C than a B2B business. So I think we have to just do some thinking about how we position respectively both to touch them in a simple way and to serve them on our platform and so we've been looking at various ways to enhance that capability and that's the position there. Generally going back to the beginning of your question, our Medical business actually is performing well. I mean, if you look at this in a low utilization environment and you take as a discrete factor that Jeff just described, our core business is doing well. Our strategic accounts are growing. We grow our consumables. We've significantly expanded our footprint on position preference in AssuraMed, achieved the numbers that we said that they would achieve in terms of accretion. So I'm feeling pretty optimistic about the way we're position in that business and we'll just wrestle through some of those smaller challenges. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company : Okay that's great. If I recall, though, when you acquired AssuraMed last year, what, a year and a half ago, that was one of the things you talked about, them bringing you sort of some expertise in small picking and packing that could help your physician business. Has that not yet translated or is that still your -- are we then closer to it? George Barrett : Yes, that's a great observation. I should have pointed it out. I think it has been helpful but I would also say this, we've had some real opportunity directly in the home estate. And so as we've looked at this past year most of our efforts would be AssuraMed or Cardinal At Home -- I managed somehow to bury the lead, as they say, before defining our new branding. Our Cardinal At Home actually has more significant opportunity directly in that business and that's really where we've devoted most of our energy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for the questions. Just a couple on the assumptions around guidance. One, I thought my understanding here was that there would be more brand to generic conversions in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014. So just trying to understand the assumption a little bit better about less contribution from new generic launches. Jeff Henderson : Hey, Bob, this is Jeff. Yes, what I said was that the benefit that accrued to us from new generic launches in 2015 we expect it to be slightly less than 2014. Whether the actual amount of branded dollars that those generic are not increased or decreased is a different question? What we look at -- when we look at each launch on a case-by-case basis and look at whether it's exclusive or not and the timing et cetera, the net result in our forecast is a slight decrease in the contributions from new generic launches. Now obviously like every year there is a certain amount of estimates and educated guesswork that goes on and inevitably the year turns out a little bit different than we expected. And frankly the last couple of years turned out more positive than we expected. So we'll continue to assess this as the year goes on but based on our best information right now we think the benefit to us is a slight decrease. Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs : And I guess the follow-up, just around the assumptions, again, would be around the assumption around slight generic deflation. I would think your average price per generic would be higher in 2015 relative to 2014, just again, if I think about all the attractive anticipated launches in 2015. I guess I'm just trying to better understand if the expectation for slight generic deflation is on your total book or is this more a comment on a like-for-like generic basis year over year? George Barrett : Its like-for-like generic, Bob. The way we calculate generic deflation is we look at all the generics we had on our book prior year and look at their expected prices as a portfolio for the next year. So it actually does not include generics that launch over the course of the year, so it's a like-for-like analysis. Operator : We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Jeff Bailin - Credit Suisse : Good morning. It's actually Jeff Bailin in for Glen. Thanks for taking the questions. So I know China's been a nice growth driver for you guys, and the company has employed some pretty rigorous standards looking at other international markets. But as you consider the evolving marketplace, and with your competitors currently in both Europe and Brazil, do either of those markets screen incrementally more interesting than in the past right now? George Barrett : Yes, so -- good morning, Jeff. This is George speaking. I would say this; we have for many years actually looked around the international environment to see where there are opportunities for us to bring our value into the system. And we've continued to look at Europe, Brazil, has always been in our sights we've mentioned that, obviously China has been a priority for us. We'll continue to evaluate whether or not we think that there is opportunity and value for our shareholders in deploying capital into those markets. To this date we've continued to evaluate and we've made decision based on what we see as the opportunity to create value, sustainable competitive advantage, and value creation for our shareholders. So we'll continue to look at many markets. The fact that a competitor makes a move in one market is not our driver of strategy. Our driver of strategy will be what we do to compete effectively and create value for all of our shareholders. Jeff Bailin - Credit Suisse : I appreciate that color. Just a follow-up on the sourcing JV with CVS. I know it's obviously in the early months of that relationship, but anything you can comment on how your conversations with your other customers have proceeded in terms of any that might not buy generics from today perhaps being incrementally more interested in being involved on their generic sourcing with Cardinal? George Barrett : Yes, so Jeff I'll give you a bit of a generalized answer because I have to, it's a tricky area. But I would say that we have substantially through the joint venture Red Oak enhanced our scale and ultimately it's about being in the most competitive position possible. I think the market is probably going through its own changes, various players in the market as they look at their own ability to compete and compete effectively in this market. I think this may create some opportunities for us as companies look and see what their own capability looks like and whether or not they need to rethink their own model. And so I don't think it will be unusual to expect that those kinds of compensations are going on in this market and I think we're extremely well positioned, should our customer base or some of the customer base rethink the way their models work. Operator : And our next question from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good morning. First question, just some clarification on the progression of fiscal year 2015 guidance. So I know, Jeff, you said that the joint venture will have an impact on 1Q 2015 in terms of the timing of contribution of benefit versus payment. But just to clarify, do you expect the joint venture to be dilutive to your first fiscal 2015 quarter or will you be able to offset the $25 million payment by the benefit from better sourcing? Jeff Henderson : Thanks for that question Ricky. First of all I don't expect that we will expense the full amount of the $25.6 million payment in Q1. As I indicated in the call and it's a bit of a selleeb. But we will begin expensing that on a monthly basis, once substantial benefits, the material benefits begin to be realized. I think the more important part of your question though is whether we expect net benefits in Q1, and I would say yes we do, but I would say that not to any meaningful extent. But I do expect the benefit to slightly outweigh any expense that we will incur in Q1. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley : Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, just back to the topic of generic price inflation, you talked in your prepared remarks about net inflation being in low-single-digits. Your competitors, as well, are check as opposed to high-single-digits in the quarter. I know you also talked about your generic basket and your portfolio. But -- so can you just explain to us why would your basket be different versus your competitors', assuming that you're seeing inflation on retail drugs, which I assume you have got like similar share within the retail market as your two other competitors? George Barrett : Good question Ricky. First of all I do not know exactly how our competitors calculate generic inflation or deflation. As I said to Bob earlier on though we calculate it based on a like-for-like analysis of drugs that existed last year versus the price of those drugs this year, looking at the entire portfolio weighted for the volume that we have. Now again it's possible they calculate it slightly differently it's also possible that our mix of business is different. We tend to have less mail order for example than our competitors may. We may carry slightly different levels in inventory et cetera. So I can't speak for our competitors. But as I said I think low-single-digits actually describes what we saw during the quarter. Jeff Henderson : Ricky, I will just add it would be hard to actually explain a reason that there is really any difference. This probably has to do a calculation. However one company calculates versus another but the market is a market. So I'm not sure there's really a difference. Operator : And our next question from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. David Larsen - Leerink Partners : Hi. Can you talk about your ability to ship products to large doc offices on hospital campuses versus the smaller doc offices in the community setting, and progress you're making in shipping to alternate sites of care? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes, so I'll start again. I think our ability to certain general across the system David is very strong. It's probably the most challenging for us historically when we deal with very, very small practices, just in that the number of skews that they might order, the way they order, and sort of tick tack operations or not that weren't quite as designed for those. But our ability to serve across for the channel is really high. We got recognized again this year by Gartner as the number one supply chain company in healthcare. This has been an area of real strength and fluency for us across the board but there are some little gaps where I think we need to do something differently or bad and we will continue to do that. David Larsen - Leerink Partners : Okay. So, when you approach an IDN you can ship products to all their doc offices across all their sites of care, pretty much? George Barrett : Yes, we did an IDN, we're able to make a very comprehensive offer and that's important for our strategy. Operator : And our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger - William Blair : Hi, thanks very much. A follow-up question on Medical. Can you talk about your preferred product pipeline? I think you said you launched about 500 in fiscal 2014. What would your expectation be for 2015? George Barrett : We have not at this point shared publically where we are in terms of our internal target. But I do not think it would be unrealistic to expect a similar number. We are aggressively going after that. And so I would say it won't be surprising if we were in the same kind of range. John Kreger - William Blair : Great. Thanks. And, Jeff, I believe you mentioned, as you talked about the sourcing venture, that there could be an added milestone starting in 2016. Can you just talk a bit more about that? What metrics would trigger that? Should we assume that that's an annual payment or more of a quarterly true-up? Jeff Henderson : Yes, I don't want to go into a lot of detail there. But first of all the fixed payment, the $1 billion in total basically stays intact versus what we've discussed earlier. But as we went through the formation of this joint venture, looked at the long-term nature of the deal, looked at the desire it creates coming instead of going forward, we did agree that again achieving certain milestones and I won't go into specifically what those are, but should be a key certain milestones that would be additional payments that will be made on any quarterly basis after achieving those milestones. That's probably all the detail I want to get into at this point, John. Operator : And our next question from Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee. Greg Bolan - Sterne Agee : Hey thanks for taking the questions. Just on the Medical segment operating margin, I understand Canada was one source of the weakness, the other maybe a little bit weaker performance on the ambulatory side. But just as we think about FY 2015, and we think about the margins that you guys put up this quarter, it sounds like you guys possibly have done some restructuring in Canada, made some pretty decent changes. What, as we think about kind of the trajectory of Medical segment operating income should we be kind of thinking about throughout fiscal 2015? Is it kind of -- just may be this is a low point and just off of that point may be kind of an ascending trajectory? Or is it going to be somewhat spotty? How should we be thinking about Medical? Jeff Henderson : Yes, Greg, good question. Thank you. First of all just to clarify the two biggest negative drivers in Q4 were Canada as you referenced, and incentive compensation, that the amount that was pushed down to the segment based on overall corporate performance was higher than last year. Now George also indicated some disappointment with our performance in the small physician's office but from a qualitative standpoint that was not one of the bigger drivers in the quarter. George Barrett : Getting to the root of your question by going forward, we do expect overtime to continue to drive margin expansion within the Medical segments and obviously segment profit growth as well. However that won't necessarily be consistent every quarter. And in terms of the profile next year I expect most of the beneficial improvement will be back loaded for the second two quarters of the year. First half of the year, will be largely about continuing to invest in our strategic priority, particularly our physician preference items to ensure that we're reaching critical math in those of areas and I expect to begin seeing the fruits of those labors as we get into the second half of the year and beyond. Greg Bolan - Sterne Agee : That's great, thanks. And then, I'm sorry if I missed this, but just the CapEx guidance for fiscal 2015 obviously going higher. Can you just remind me what's driving that, please? George Barrett : Yes, a number of things. First of all we're going to continue to invest to improve and expand our information systems within the Pharmaceutical segment that's number one. Number two we are increasing capacity both for -- some of our physicians, I'm sorry our preferred product manufacturing and for our 3PL capacity and capabilities. And, fourthly, we're going to continue to invest to expand our geographic presence in China. Those are some of the major items I would generally characterize as though as investments in IT and investments in our key strategic priorities including the ones I just mentioned. Operator : And our next question from George Hill, Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank : Good morning, Jeff and George and thanks for taking the question. And I'll say, Jeff, I look forward to grabbing a blue or a Canadian at some point during the farewell tour. Just maybe I missed this point already, but I actually thought your fiscal 2015 was going to be a better generics launch year than your fiscal 2014, given some of the drugs that have been pushed out and what the calendar looks like for your fiscal 2015. Is there any more color you can give us on why fiscal 2015 isn't an improvement from the launch calendar perspective, or kind of maybe what you're seeing that we're not seeing? Jeff Henderson : So first of all I would not describe it as a major drop-off, like the clients in terms of the expected impact. Obviously depends on what assumptions you make for some of the larger launches. For example, the Nexium launch, still a big question mark right, regarding when and how it's going to get launched. And so depending on what you assume for that that can have a fairly material impact on the overall assumptions for the year. So it really comes down to our assumptions for each of the individual major launches and obviously we could be wrong. We tend to model these things relatively conservatively. George Hill - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up -- on the incremental payments that would get made as part of Red Oak, I would imagine that that would assume that you guys are going to deliver earnings performance above and beyond the original agreement if you guys are required to make incremental payments to CVS. And then I might even ask with that, kind of why renegotiate the deal that way? I thought part of the deal was that you guys were making the $100 million payment such that you could enjoy some more of the upside. What led to CVS having the ability to call back some of the upside? George Barrett : Yes, George the lift I think in general we've -- as we got through the process and more information, more data, and the teams got together, we felt it was appropriate to make a number of adaptations. Again this is a long-term deal. And we want to make sure that it reflects the direct value equation for both parties. So we did make some modifications that under certain circumstances and certain milestones are achieved we make some additional payment. This we feel very positive about this and the final terms of our agreement and the strength of the relationship and economics that will flow from it. I guess, I would leave it at that. Operator : And our next question from Steve Valiquette, UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS: Thanks, good morning. Just a few extra quick ones here on the Medical segment. And I guess first for the AccessClosure deal, which closed in mid May, did that provide a positive EBIT contribution or an EBIT loss in the quarter just from the deal mechanics? And will that deal still hopefully be slightly accretive in fiscal 2015? Jeff Henderson : Yes. Hi, Steve, Jeff. It was effectively neutral to our Q4 given that we're still just ramping it up and continuing to invest to expand our capabilities there. And, yes, our assessment of it being slightly accretive in FY 2015 has not changed. If anything or even more enthusiastic about the potential of that portfolio can bring to us in the future. George Barrett : Yes, the Mynx product line is really one we're excited about it. And so, as Jeff said, we're feeling pretty enthusiastic about the way this is unfolding. Steven Valiquette - UBS: Okay. One other quick one, just on Red Oak, even though the party's just getting started there. Can you remind us again of the just feasibility of other partners potentially joining into that JV? We've seen with some of the others ones in the industry that other parties have come on later which have enhanced those. I'm just curious, again, let's say, feasibility of that happening for Red Oak. Thanks. George Barrett : So Steve, we obviously, we have always the opportunity to expand our customer base bringing people into the venture itself is a different story. Today our joint venture is strictly between CVS Caremark and Cardinal Health. And we're thrilled about that relationship. But we always have the opportunity to again take advantage of the scale that we've achieved and sort of customers of every kind around the system. Operator : We will take our next question from Garen Sarafian, Citibank. Garen Sarafian - Citibank: Good morning, guys, thanks for taking the questions. First, I want to follow-up on the JV questions. I understand things -- it sounds like things were fluid in terms of as you looked at the deal, and you guys made some adjustments. But I'm just wondering, does it continue to be a fluid kind of a situation where terms and payments might change one way or the other as you go through this year? Or is this sort of the final leg as you guys were finalizing the deal? George Barrett : Yes, I think we've -- thanks for the question, Garen and good morning. I think we've at this point finalized all the agreements that formed the venture. Obviously it's a fluid market. So we're always as a company as we sell products, we refine our market condition. But all the terms that are part of the joint venture agreement are now done and complete. Red Oak has formed, it has got leadership and talent and it's negotiating directly with manufactures today. Garen Sarafian - Citibank: Got it. Great. And then just a follow-up on this fiscal year. Just on the distribution of EPS, I know you try to stay away from giving quarterly guidance but there seems to be first quarter some comments that it will be the most challenging through this year. With Red Oak coming on to the back half of the year, it looks like the slope may be a little bit steeper towards the back end. But when I look at your historical numbers, the back half really hasn't exceeded about 53%, 54% of your annual earnings. So do you expect this year to be higher than that? Or if you can just give us any sort of quarterly progression that would be really helpful. Thanks. George Barrett : Yes. Thanks. I'm not going to get into too much details because I don't want to get down to slippery slope to provide detail quarterly guidance. I will repeat what I said though, that we do expect Q1 to be the lightest. And just to clarify, what you said, we expect meaningful net benefit from the CVS JV to begin to materialize at the end of Q1, not towards the second half of the year, as you mentioned. But yes, Q1 should be the lightest. Beyond that, I would say the rest of the quarter's fair amount of consistency. We do have historical seasonality, which tends to make our Q3 larger than the other quarters. Over the last couple of years though that seasonality has continued to reduce as generics have taken up a bigger portion of the portfolio as less and less of our branded income come from contingent payments. And the branded price increases have tended to be spread more evenly throughout the year. That all said, I would expect our Q3 still would be the strongest quarter of the year, although probably less extreme that we might have seen two or three years ago. Operator : And we will take our final question from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : George, you had mentioned the possibility of expanding your relationship with CVS with Walgreens gone and the joint venture kind of up and running. Are any updates here in terms of any kind of meaningful relationship expansions? George Barrett : Good morning, Rob. Yes, just I would say again, I probably have to reiterate what I had said earlier. I think our relationship has probably never been stronger. We continue to explore ways to create value for one another. And I fully expect that to continue. So I can't provide any more specifics in that other than to say that working our way through the incredibly intricate details of getting to this go-live has only strengthened I think our relationship and we feel god about that. So it's probably as much as I can say. Sally Curley : Operator, I think this was our last question. Operator : Yes. That concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Barrett, at this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for additional or closing remarks. George Barrett : Great. Thanks very much. Listen, thank you to all for joining us today and giving us a chance to cover what was a really important and I think successful 2014. We look forward to our FY 2015 and seeing all of you soon. Thanks for dialing in. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

George? George S. Barrett: Thanks, Sally, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2015 is off to a really good start. Our organization performed well across the board. And I'm proud of the work our people have done in positioning the organization to anticipate and address the evolving needs of a fast-changing market. During Q1, we saw the growth in both Pharmaceutical and Medical segment profits. Our gross margin rate expanded by over 40 basis points to 5.6%. And we returned nearly $500 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Total revenues for the quarter were $24.1 billion, a decline of 2% versus last year's first quarter. This is the last quarter in which we will be comparing to a prior year period, which included sales to Walgreens. The declines in the Walgreens contract expiration was largely offset by sales growth from both new and existing customers. Our first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1, down from last year's $1.10, which included an $0.18 benefit related to tax settlements. Back in August, as we began our fiscal 2015 year, we provided a non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30. We are reaffirming that guidance today. I will note, however, that while we still expect the contribution to profit to be more back-half weighted, the strong start to the year is certainly an encouraging sign. I'll provide a very quick overview of our first quarter, which Jeff will cover in greater detail during his remarks. I'd like to devote the rest of my time this morning to covering our progress on our strategic priorities. Our Pharmaceutical segment reported revenues of $21.2 billion, down 3%. Revenue growth from both new and existing customers partially offset the Walgreens effect, as I noted earlier. Our Pharma segment margins continued to expand. Pharmaceutical Distribution had an excellent beginning to the year. We continue to outgrow all markets, with the exception of chain drug, where, of course, Walgreens affected the numbers. And I'm happy to say, this is the last quarter where we will feel the Walgreens quarterly headwind. Our Pharma teams continue to demonstrate a deep understanding of market dynamics and those tools, which can help our customers compete in this extraordinary market. Investments in analytics, reporting and dashboarding are giving customers needed visibility into their performance against critical metrics. Improving performance is essential to network access and a top priority for pharmaceuticals. Specialty Solutions continues its strong performance, again, showing double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. And our Nuclear pharmacy business has made excellent progress after the dramatic market changes of the past few years. The introduction of Xofigo, a product used to treat metastatic cancers in bone, has been an important introduction for the radiopharmaceutical market and should increasingly contribute to our Nuclear performance. Our Medical segment had a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, and segment profit increased by more than 6%. This is good news in the context of an environment in which system-wide utilization has remained somewhat subdued. Cardinal Health at Home, the former AssuraMed business, continues to perform well. We're particularly excited that our direct-to-patient business reported strong double-digit growth. We continue to see great opportunity here, enabled by an expanding product line and an increase in Cardinal Health brand of products for the home. Overall, our Medical segment continues to demonstrate great balance, which is very valuable at a time with enormous and up and rapid change. Just as important, our Medical segment continues to innovate and explore new ways to bring value to a system hungry for solutions to new challenges. I will touch on these as I discuss our strategic priorities. Finally, in relation to the quarter, I would note that China had an outstanding first quarter, with revenues up by more than 30%, as well as expanding operating margins. We continued to broaden our footprint, build the direct-to-patient pharmacy business and offer both distribution and a widening range of services aligned with our biopharma and medical device partners. As I mentioned earlier on the call, I'd like to devote much of my time today to covering the progress we're making on our strategic priorities. Over the past few years, we have been intensifying our efforts in these priority areas. Each of these priorities aligns with the powerful changes occurring around health care. Success in these areas continues to contribute to value for our customers, growth of our business and expansion of our margins. These priorities include : generic pharmaceuticals; solutions in the specialty pharmaceutical arena; growth in our product and service offerings to hospitals and health systems; increasing presence in ambulatory; and post-acute settings and growth in the Chinese market. So let me touch on each of these one by one. First, generics. With close to 85% of all prescriptions being filled with a generic pharmaceutical, it has never been more important to be a market leader. From our perspective, this requires several ingredients : first, a solid base of customers who recognize the benefit of our model; second, significant scale; and third, the experience and know-how to source products from a complex and global supply network. On the first, we now serve over 20,000 retail pharmacies, and nearly half of them use Cardinal Health as their primary source for generic drugs. As it relates to scale and experience, I'm extremely optimistic about the strategic and financial value of Red Oak, our generic sourcing joint venture with CVS Health. As you know, Red Oak Sourcing has been up and operational since early July. And I could not be more excited about the progress to date. Red Oak will be the largest purchaser of generic drugs for the U.S. market, the world's largest generic market. The leadership team of Red Oak has worked incredibly hard to design a model, which is straightforward, simple, transparent for manufacturers, with a single point of decision-making and clear working terms. We've had an encouraging response from the manufacturers who appreciate the simplicity of the program and recognize the opportunity to work closely with us. The group leverages the extensive knowledge of the Cardinal Health and CVS Health organizations about the global generic supply system. Having said this, any of you attending a Red Oak meeting would have difficulty identifying who was a former Cardinal Health employee and who came from CVS Health. At this stage, we can say that we fully expect to achieve our goals for the year. Although as we've mentioned, because of the transition out of each company's respective programs, the benefits of Red Oak's new agreement will ramp over time. Turning to Specialty. As a health care system, we are at an important inflection point in the application of scientific innovation, which has been incubating over the past 2 decades. We are seeing the commercialization of pharmaceutical therapies, which leverage the convergence of the expansion of our understanding in human biology and the explosive access to big data. And the result is a flow of drugs, which offer both exciting new treatments for many of the challenging diseases of our time, as well as the promise for cures. It is in this context that our progress in Specialty should be viewed. Although we typically don't break out our Specialty financials, I wanted to just give you a sense of our progress. We began the repositioning of our Specialty organization about 4 years ago, with a business of approximately $1 billion. Since that time, our run rate for annual revenue has grown to approximately $5 billion. Our Specialty Distribution has shown consistent growth over the past few years. Further, we acquired Sonexus Health, a patient access and support hub in March of 2014. Feedback and momentum from customers has been very positive, and the asset fits very well into our overall biopharma offering. In the new world of managing risk and improving the patient experience around quality, cost and outcomes, we are working with several major oncology practices on deploying new tools like our PathWare product to help them operate in this new environment. We continue to advance our position and our support of community oncologists and specialists. Turning to health systems and hospital solutions. As healthcare goes through rapid changes, we continue to focus on providing scaled solutions for our acute care customers that enable them to deliver great patient care more cost effectively. First, our physician preference item. We believe that there is an opportunity to help our acute-care partners by delivering what we refer to as evidence-based equivalents in some medical surgical categories that represent significant pain points for our customers. We have made tangible progress in this area, and I'd like to provide more color on this. We see the trauma space as an area of low clinical differentiation and weak standardization. And with that in mind, we invested in a business called Emerge Medical last year. That product line has been increasing. In the past quarter, we assumed ownership of Emerge Medical to strengthen our position in orthopedics. This will allow us to launch a full line of trauma products late in this fiscal year and into early FY '16, while building credibility with key institutions over the coming months. The Emerge products were extremely well received at the Orthopaedic Trauma Association's Annual Meeting in Tampa just a few weeks ago. About 6 months ago, we completed the acquisition of AccessClosure as a first step into the interventional cardiology area. AccessClosure has a simplified, standardized and more forward-looking go-to-market model, all built around the Mynx product line, which gives us great presence and credibility with interventional cardiologists. Finally, consistent with our program to address physician preference items, we acquired this past quarter a company called Innovative Therapies, a negative pressure wound therapy company with a proven technology, and we are now launching over 250 products in advanced and traditional wound care. The combination of these acquisitions and the work that we've done these past few years gives us the foundation of a comprehensive program to help our customers deliver care in the most cost-effective way with the highest quality. Beyond physician preference items, we continue to believe that healthcare has significant efficiency gaps. With this in mind, we focused on innovations that improve the efficiency of the overall supply chain. We've made several investments over the past 12 months to create new growth platforms. We invested in an RFID technology called WaveMark, an inventory management solution to help both suppliers and customers optimize their supply chain and reduce inventory and labor costs. An example is an application targeted to tracking and tracing inventory flowing through a large customer's cath lab. We have launched this and several other initiatives under our umbrella of the Cardinal Health logistics solutions. Our customers have responded well as evidenced by the progress in this quarter. As we move to alternate types of care like ambulatory and post-acute settings, you've heard us talk consistently about the importance of being able to serve patients across the continuum of care. We have a system in the U.S. that was built to treat acute illness, but a population increasingly suffering from multiple chronic illnesses. This requires a rethinking of the way and the place in which we deliver care. We've made important moves to address these channels. First, our ambulatory service centers have a market leading position with increasing connectivity to our IDN customers and have grown solidly in the last few years. And we continue to take actions to cost -- to more cost effectively provide products and services to smaller physician practices. Our acquisition of AssuraMed, now called Cardinal Health at Home, was a commitment to address a growing number of Americans who need care in the home. The acquisition has gone extremely well, and our direct-to-patient business continues to grow at double-digit rates. Just a few comments about our progress in China. When we entered China in 2010 with the acquisition of Yong Yu, the business was a pharmaceutical-centric national distribution business, providing basic import, 3PL and warehousing functions with a fairly limited geographic presence. Since then, we have made substantial progress in China, growing the business from approximately $1 billion in revenue in fiscal '11 to $2.6 billion in FY '14. We have developed a strong local presence in 10 regions, expanded DCs from 7 to 13 and completed 7 small tuck-in acquisitions. We opened our first direct-to-patient specialty pharmacy in China in calendar 2013. Identifying a niche, we could fill using our unique competencies in compliance and secure supply chain. Today, we operate about 30 of these specialty retail pharmacies. Expanding beyond pharmaceuticals, we now handle a wide range of products for the Chinese market, including clinical trial material, medical devices and consumables, vaccines, diagnostics, biologics and blood products. We've added capabilities, including industry-leading compliance management, cold chain logistics in diagnostics and vaccine management, data analytics capabilities and hospital, pharmacy and retail channel services. In summary, our organization is well aligned around all of our enterprise-wide priorities, and we're truly excited about the opportunities they represent. I'd like to make a few quick comments about the Ebola situation, as a number of you have asked us about whether there has been any implications for our business. Let me start by saying that our organization responded quickly to the challenges confronting Liberia and other West African nations. Our donations of products and supplies have been substantial and our people have demonstrated great generosity. As it relates to concerns here in the U.S. and the implications for our business, I would say that we would not expect a demand for safety-related products and supplies to have any material impact on our economics. We do anticipate some shortages of safety products, particularly those recently specified by the CDC, which, as you might expect, have experienced a sudden increase in demand. We will continue to work closely with all customers and manufacturers to help navigate the supply issues. As it relates the products we produce such as gloves, we are operating at full capacity. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, since we last spoke, we announced the appointment of Mike Kaufmann to succeed Jeff as the Chief Financial Officer of Cardinal Health. Mike, Jeff and I have been working closely to map out the transition. Although Mike has not yet begun his new role, we want to do give him a chance today to say a quick hello, and introduce himself to those of you have not yet met him. Mike? Michael C. Kaufmann: Thanks, George. I'm really excited to be moving into the CFO role. What you may not know about me is that while I've spent most of my 24 years here at Cardinal Health in sales, procurement and general management, I've also been a division controller and CFO for our Medical and Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses. I've also spent over 5 years in public accounting before I joined Cardinal. So in many ways, I'm going back to my roots. George, Jeff and I are already working together on the transition. And with Jeff here through August, I'm confident it will be smooth. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months at the various conferences and events. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for his final earnings call as CFO. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, George and Mike. I share George's sentiment in welcoming Mike and look forward to passing him the CFO baton officially in a few weeks. As you can tell from George's remarks, we're off to a strong start and making very good progress on the key strategic initiatives that will drive our performance this fiscal year and beyond. In my prepared remarks, I will first focus on outlining the drivers of the first quarter financial performance and then provide some insight into our expectations as we move through the remainder of fiscal '15. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Although non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1, down 9% versus the prior year, the first quarter of fiscal '14 included an $0.18 favorable impact related to the settlement of federal and state tax matters. Eliminating the tax elements from the prior year, non-GAAP EPS grew 9%. Revenues at $24.1 billion exceeded our expectations in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, the fiscal 2015 first quarter revenue grew a robust 13%. Gross margin dollars were up 6% for the quarter, and the gross margin rate expanded 42 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. Total SG&A increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by increased acquisition-related expenses. Consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings were up 6% to $566 million. The non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 18 basis points versus the prior year to 2.35%. Interest and other expense was essentially flat to last year. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 36.5%. As I previously mentioned, in Q1 of last fiscal year, the tax rate was unusually low due to the favorable impact of certain settlements. Excluding those settlements, the fiscal 2014 first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 37.3%, slightly higher than our tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter. Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 340 million, 3.6 million shares favorable to the prior year's quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased $360 million worth of shares. And I'm confident we'll exceed the $500 million in share repurchase we mentioned in August as part of our FY '15 assumptions. As of the end of Q1, we had almost $1.4 billion of repo authorization remaining under our Board approval. Moving to consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. Operating cash flow in the quarter was relatively light, but largely as the function of timing as we saw some shift between quarters. As a reminder, OCF in Q1 of FY '14 was unusually high due to the accelerated nature of the wind down of the Walgreens contract. At the end of this quarter just ended, we had $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet, which includes $447 million held internationally. Working capital days came in at 8.7 days. In comparison to the prior year, it's really meaningful this quarter, as last year's figures were skewed due to the Walgreens contract rollout. Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Pharmaceutical segment revenue declined 3% to $21.2 billion. As we mentioned, the quarter comparison includes 2 months of impact in Q1 of FY '14 related to the conclusion of the Walgreens contract. Excluding that impact, Pharma segment revenues grew 15% year-over-year, driven by growth in our existing customer base and new customers, as well as strong growth in our Pharma segment in China. In addition to China, Pharma revenues reflect increases across our generics, specialty and Nuclear businesses. Pharma segment profit increased 4% to $451 million, with a margin rate up 14 basis points compared to the prior year's Q1. These solid results are due to growth in new and existing customers, as well as strong performance under our generics programs. With respect to our generics programs, the net impact of the Red Oak JV was slightly accretive in the quarter, although it's still early in a ramp-up of the benefits we're expecting. And we did see a slight year-over-year increase in contribution from generic price increases in the quarter. Overall, generic percent inflation was higher than last year's Q1, but originally consistent with Q4 of last year. As a reminder, we calculate generic deflation or inflation based on products that have been in the market for at least a year and based on weighted average selling price. And finally, I want to note that the quarter includes benefit from resolution of some long-standing customer issues worth about $20 million. Let's go down to the Medical segment performance. Revenue for the Medical segment increased 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by acquisitions and a net positive impact of customer growth. Within our strategic hospital accounts, we continue to see organic growth, with those customers increasing almost 4%. This is an indication that we're focusing on the things that are most important to this customer base. More broadly, we're seeing that overall utilization has stabilized to some extent, and there are pockets developed [ph] at usage within healthcare. However, it is not yet at a point where we would describe it as an uptick in overall market utilization. During the quarter, Medical segment profit increased over 6% to $113 million. This increase is a result of profit growth in Cardinal Health branded products, as well as growth in services, partially offset by a decline in contribution from national brands. Our Canadian business continues to operate in a tough market environment, but we are implementing the operational and product mix changes necessary to adapt. Finally, as George mentioned, we have now entered into 3 categories we were targeting for our Cardinal Health brand physician preference items. While we are pleased with this progress, we are still early -- we are still in the early stages of this medium-term driver and expect a gradual ramp during the course of the year. By now, much of the focus is on launching the products and positioning our organization for future growth in this area. I'd also like to make a few comments on our China business, which spans both of our reporting segments. As we approach the 4-year anniversary of the initial Yong Yu acquisition, I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made, much of which George highlighted in his remarks. China revenue saw strong growth again this quarter, posting a year-over-year increase of 34%, driven by new and existing customers. We continued to significantly outpace the healthcare market growth in China, while pursuing our strategy of a geographic expansion to the relevant population centers and expanding our capabilities to meet the needs of this unique market. Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.22 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses increased due to a $27 million reserve related to the previously disclosed Florida DEA matter. Looking to the rest of the fiscal year. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance we provided in August of $4.10 to $4.30. Reflecting this range are a few assumptions, which we think are worth updating from the expectations we had outlined when we spoke to you during our August earnings call. First, we are incrementally more positive on the consolidated revenue growth for the full year, which we have previously described as up modestly. This is largely driven by pharma brand sales. Second, we have reduced our forecast for earnings contribution from new generic launches. On a specific note, built into our original planned assumptions for our Pharma segment was a forecast for a generic Nexium launch in November of this year. However, given recent developments, we no longer expect any benefit in our fiscal 2015 from a generic Nexium launch. Third, given what we have seen in the first quarter, our expectation for full year generic pricing has changed from slight deflation to slight inflation. However, our full year forecast for the earnings impact from generic price increase remains lower than the amount we realized last year. Finally, given recent oil price movements, we do forecast some benefit in certain of our commodity costs within the Medical segment in the second half of the year versus original expectation. However, that upside is partially offset by negative foreign exchange movements. Most of the underlying corporate assumptions, shown on Slide 9, remain unchanged from our previous comments. However, I do want to mention a couple of items. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 36% and 37%. As we said previously, this will likely fluctuate quarterly due to the unique items affecting individual periods. Also, note that we are increasing our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization to approximately $184 million or $0.35 per share. This change is due to a few smaller acquisitions that closed during the quarter. It has no impact on our non-GAAP earnings. So when you add it all up, and recognizing the fact that we're only 1 quarter into the year, our full year guidance range has not changed. One final comment about the evolution of earnings over the course of the year, a pattern which has not really changed substantially from our original expectations. We continue to expect the year to be quite back-half loaded from an operating earnings growth standpoint, driven by a few factors. As I stated previously, the benefits in the Red Oak Sourcing entity will ramp over time. Further, we'll be investing upfront to accelerate the growth of Cardinal Health brand physician preference items over the medium term. Bottom line, there are a number of puts and takes to the year. However, overall, I feel good about our organization's ability to respond to a rapidly changing environment and how we are positioned coming into the first quarter. In closing, I'd like to say that after almost 40 earnings calls, more than 150 sell-side events and 1,700 or so investor meetings, I'm certainly ready to sleep a little more. As I've said to some of you in person, I've always considered investor relations to be one of the most gratifying parts of my role. I view investors and analysts as my customers, and I've appreciated the back and forth and relationships we've enjoyed over the past decade. And I take pride that your confidence and investments in Cardinal have been rewarded over the years. To all of our Cardinal employees, you'll still see me around through next summer. I look forward to working with Mike as we transition him into the CFO role and to continue to work closely with George and my China colleagues until my retirement next August. This is my last earnings call as your CFO, so let me just say what a privilege it has been to serve you in this role for the past 9.5 years. We've been through a lot together, and you created a great company of which we can be very proud. Thank you, all. So with that, I'll say goodbye for now. Operator, let's begin our Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I was curious if you think the Canadian business was weak as a protest to your leaving the company. Jeffrey W. Henderson: I'm sure that had a big piece to play in it, yes, Ross. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe just -- yes, there was a lot of assumption changes, it seemed like, on the generics side. We know about some of the pushouts and obviously, we've all been tracking inflation. I mean, as you look at the performance in the Pharma business, I mean, x lag, obviously, the growth was pretty spectacular. As you sort of break down your thoughts more so on the profit side for the quarter, obviously, not much you can give on the number side, but just more anecdotally, where do you feel like you really sort of excelled on margin dollars? And where are you hoping for a little bit better performance in the year? Obviously, we know Red Oak is going to come in, but I'm curious just more so on the line items. George S. Barrett: Let me just start. I think part of the driver for us is a focus on key priorities, and that really influences the mix of our product lines and services. And so as we look across the business, those areas where we're growing, I think, are higher value areas for our customer base. And as a result, they tend to be higher-margin businesses for us. So again, I think we're doing very well in generics. That customer base is expanding. Our specialty business continues to grow. On our medical side, again, utilization was okay. Obviously, we\u2018re still seeing it to be somewhat subdued. But I think we're really doing well with our strategic accounts and then, again, with key products in those accounts that are really important drivers for us and important value drivers for them. So I think it's largely about a very clear focus on priorities and mix. Jeff, I don't know what we might want to add to that. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. I mean, if you look at -- I'll start with Pharma. If you look at each of the different businesses within the Pharma business, you got the core Pharma Distribution, Nuclear, specialty and the China piece that's relevant to Pharma, they all outperformed our expectations for the quarter. So I'd say, really, across the board, we're pretty pleased with the results. But I think you touched on the one area that wasn't a disappointment, but I think we're still not seeing the full potential from yet, and that's the Red Oak JV. As we've always said, there's going to be a ramp-up over time. Q1 was largely about setting up the JV, starting the discussions with the manufacturers and starting to sign up manufacturers. But as we've always expected, the actual benefit that will flow through to us will come over time. So I'd say that's the one piece that was largely missing from Q1, but that was as expected. George S. Barrett: Yes, it's important. That is what we anticipated. So again, not just one that didn't happen, I think that's key, is that we know that, that flows as the year goes. Jeffrey W. Henderson: On the... George S. Barrett: And just -- yes, go ahead. Jeffrey W. Henderson: No, I was going to say, on the Medical side, obviously, we're pleased to see some of the profit growth for the quarter, particularly in a utilization environment that still really hasn't ticked up yet. I think the one area that we're -- again, this is not a disappointment, just something that we knew was going to happen. We're still investing in our physician preference item rollouts. And it's more of an investment story right now than it is a profit story, but that's expected. We want to make sure that we're properly positioned and we have the right portfolio of products and the right sales force and organizations supporting it, et cetera. So we're going to see those benefits more towards the latter part of this fiscal year and heading into next year. So again, not a disappointment, just something that really wasn't a significant driver for us in the quarter. Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And just quickly, it seems like you picked up the tuck-in M&A activity strictly in the Medical side. You've got sort of a differentiated strategy there. What's the pipeline look like? And do you feel like you're filling in a lot of the holes? You moved into wound care, you've got some stuff in ortho now. What else is sort of left? George S. Barrett: Well, I mean, I think now it's executing. As Jeff said, these are major initiatives for us that we've always described as sort of midterm drivers, Ross. So I think the positioning on orthopedics is really good. By the end of this year, we're going to start to see some of that flow through the system. The move into cardiovascular, interventional cardiology, I think, was really exciting for us. It's doing well, and that bag will begin to fill. And then as we think about wound care, that's a really interesting area for us. And as I mentioned, we are talking about 250 launches that are sort of in process. So I think now, it's more about rolling it out, executing, and we're really excited about these programs. Operator : And we'll go now to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And Jeff, just let me say that I wish you well in your retirement, and I really enjoyed working with you over the years and the last 40-plus earnings calls. So my first question, really, George, just to follow up on what you're talking about around PPI products and clearly, tuck-in acquisitions. But do you see any bigger opportunities in the market? This is clearly a place that the Cardinal has differentiated themselves on the med-surg side. I think I heard you earlier talking about continuing to take action to deliver products to physician offices. Do you feel like you have what you need in order to deliver to physician offices? Or do you need to make an acquisition to continue to grow that business? George S. Barrett: So there are 2 parts to that question. The first one is really around our PPI program. And again, I think for us, we like where we are. We'll continue always to look for opportunities to accelerate those programs. So we've got sort of a dual responsibility now. One is to make sure that we're doing the right strategic things to get the bag position to sell with good coverage, and the second part is really about execution and making it happen. So I think we've got a great foundation now, but we'll continue to look at opportunities, both organically to drive the program, new products and whether or not there may or may not be opportunities externally. The second part is really about the physician's office. And here's what I'd say. I would say, again, there are sort of 2 stories to it. Part of the physician office business, as you know, is increasingly affiliating with the IDNs, and we've had obviously an enterprise-wide relationship with many of those IDNs and tend to be stronger there. We've been less strong in those independent practices, and we continue to look at various ways to strengthen that part of our business. But I think, overall, as I look -- if I draw a continuum of our business, we feel pretty strong in the continuum of care, but we'll continue to look at ways to strengthen any pockets of -- new pockets where we're not quite as strong. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I guess, really, what I'm looking for is, as we think about Cardinal, you've got a lot of cash spinning on your balance sheet, your business is running very well, should we expect to see you do a larger acquisition this year? I mean, that's really what I'm looking at. So I was trying to figure out different places where you could potentially add to your business. But really, the core of my question is, should we expect Cardinal to do something bigger in this fiscal year? George S. Barrett: Yes, I know. I totally understand the question, Lisa. I think you know it's a hard one to answer. I think you should expect Cardinal to deploy its capital efficiently and I hope, very smartly. So when we see opportunities externally that we think drive our strategies, we are not going to be shy about pursuing them, but we also see obligation to make sure that we're returning cash to shareholders. If those opportunities aren\u2019t appearing in the right way strategically as it relates to acquisitions, then we'll look very carefully at how we deploy capital. Jeff, any -- do you want to... Jeffrey W. Henderson: An example of that is what happened in the first quarter, right? We were building up cash, and those significant opportunities were executed during Q1. So we found an opportunity to use that cash to buy back shares, and that's sort of our -- will be our ongoing approach to it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And Jeff, I'll continue with pats on the back. Nice work. And it's been a pleasure working with you. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, George. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I ask -- one thing I'd like to revisit is Red Oak. I'm kind of surprised to hear that it's been accretive this early in the JV. I guess, what I would -- I'd ask a couple of things is -- could you provide -- I don't know if you can provide any more color on the accretion, but I assume it was accretive net of the payment to CVS. And then the other comment, George, that you made was that manufacturers appreciate kind of how simple and streamlined the program is. I guess, is there any color that you can give us on how Red Oak might be -- or how you guys perceive Red Oak to be differentiated from any of the other procurement programs? Jeffrey W. Henderson: [indiscernible], George. Again, thanks for the nice words. We did not expense any of the payment to Cardinal Health in the first quarter. That payment, from a cash standpoint, will flow for the first time in Q2 of this year, and we'll begin expensing it on a monthly basis starting in October. So there was no expense related to that payment in Q1. So the benefit that we saw largely flow to the bottom line, although I would describe those benefits as relatively minimal at this point. George S. Barrett: George, I'll sort of touch on the second one. Again, I'm going to be careful because, obviously, this is -- the work that we're doing here in Red Oak and the relationships with the manufacturers is quite proprietary and sensitive. I would just say this. There's a lot of change happening in the system that could be very disquieting for people. We recognized early on that a key to our relationship with manufacturers was to be very, very clear about terms and conditions, about where the decisions were going to be made, about -- there are so many mechanical parts in a generic program, moving parts. And we realized that if we could make that very, very simple, that, that would be appreciated. And that has some value to the manufacturers. And so what I would say, without going too far into it, is that we've had a huge number of meetings already. We're getting very good and very positive feedback that people know what we're trying to do, they understand it. And I would say, people -- and they're really cooperative in working with us, and they've expressed some support for the way we've approached this and just the simplicity of the program. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up there would be is it seems like if you've looked at the other procurement situations that have taken place in the industry, the ramp that seems to come from these JVs or whatever we want to call them actually winds up being pretty quick. I would just ask, is that your assumption as well is that Red Oak will ramp pretty quickly and we should -- if we think about by the end of fiscal '15, exiting the year, we should probably see pretty close to the full annualized benefit? George S. Barrett: Well, let me start first, and then I'll turn it to Jeff. This is George. I probably would not comment on anybody else's programs and the speed at which they can achieve that. It's just not my place. I think for us, I'm incredibly proud of the work that's been done in less than a year to get this thing rolling. You would be astonished at how many moving parts there are. So great work has been done. As we've said, we do expect to start to see a more rich benefit as the year unfolds. But Jeff, a little... Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. George, I like the way you described it, as getting to a more normal run rate by the end of this fiscal year is a fair comment and consistent with what I've said previously. That doesn't mean there won't be incremental benefits that we\u2019ll go for in FY '16 and '17 and beyond. That definitely will be the case. But again, characterizing it as reaching a more normal run rate by the end of fiscal '15, I think is fair. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Percher from Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Strategic priority commentary, and I wanted to drill in a little bit on specialty, where you talked about moving from $1 billion to $5 billion today. I guess, my first question is, is the $5 billion really specialty distribution, specialty pharmacy, hub services outside of specialty flowing through the traditional wholesale business? And then could you talk a bit about where you focused and grown in those different components of the specialty business? George S. Barrett: Yes. Thanks, Eric. It's -- this is George. It's a little bit of all of the above. First of all, and again, I'm just -- we're talking really about run rate. It's been encouraging. I think the good news about the way we've approached this -- we've had a pretty methodical approach to our specialty business, and most of this is organic, as you know. I think we've seen each of the little subsegments of our specialty work, whether that's our services to biopharma or distribution as pieces that we need to drive. Obviously, from a revenue standpoint, distribution is always going to carry more weight. But I think in general, we're pretty encouraged by the progress. And I think the addition of this patient hub for us, while it's very early, I think, is really an interesting value driver as it relates to the work that we can do to provide to pharma companies, and thinking about where they're going, how they're trying to increase those touch points with patients in the system. So I would say, generally speaking, we're pretty encouraged by what's happened through most of those sub-businesses and encouraged by the run rate, much of it organic. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Let me just add to that. We've always said that achieving success in specialty is going to be dependent on really 2 factors : number one, getting to critical mass and size so that we're relevant to the manufacturers and to the docs and the payers. I think now, with a $5 billion run rate, we can definitely say we're relevant, and then we have a significant share now of the specialty market. The second piece was, as we gained relevance from a size standpoint to start wrapping services -- or continue to wrap services around that volume, that we can profitize with the manufacturers, et cetera. And that has also happened as well and was accelerated clearly last January with the purchase of Sonexus, which really helped to round out the toolkit that we have now that we can sell as services to the players in specialty. So I do feel very good about the positioning we've achieved over the last couple of years. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So it's felt like some of your positioning was that you didn't need to have a massive footprint but enough to be relevant to manufacture. So it sounds like you're feeling that you've reached that in Sonexus, and the hub services will be the test case for your ability to have relevance. And I guess, the way I would throw a question on there is, how do you think that your assets differentiate from others when manufacturers are deciding which hub to go with? George S. Barrett: So it's a great question, Eric. Here's what I'd say. This is going to be a story of defining services that are very uniquely targeted to a biopharma company and the patient population that they are addressing. And so I'd love to tell you that there's a broad answer to that. It's really a sort of \"you've seen one, you've seen one\" kind of answer. We're very targeted. We actually have a innovation center that is -- all they do is software solutions that address unique needs of some of our customer base. This would be one of those customer bases. So I don't know if I could do a comparative analysis for you rather than say our team is very targeted. And we certainly have the presence in the market to allow us to do the things that we like to do and have those touch points. So -- but very -- honestly, very targeted, very customer-centric, practice-centric work. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And congrats, Jeff. Good luck with everything going forward. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, Charles. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Just a -- actually, a question on Nuclear. This quarter, you talked pretty positively about it. I believe a little -- you talked kind of positively about it last quarter. Can you tell us the shape of this business at this point? If I recall, years ago, I mean, this was something like maybe almost a $2 billion business with something like 20% EBIT margins. Can you kind of give us a sense of the financial health of this? And one time, you talked about how much you liked it. How does it stand now in relation to some -- all the other priorities as you look forward? George S. Barrett: So Charles, let me just start, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff to give you color on the financial aspects of it. But here's what I'd say. The business had been through, I think I described it, really significant change over the couple of years. It\u2019s really the market has gone through this significant change, primarily around the utilization. Our hope is that those changes have essentially worked their way through the system, and those are beginning to stabilize. That's good news for us. The second element of -- so one is that, while it's not -- you're not seeing a big increase. What we've seen is some stabilizing. The second element, which is exciting, is the development of new technologies. And so I'd use Xofigo just as an example. So we're not just now seeing radiotherapeutic, but radiopharmaceuticals, and I think there some opportunities there, and we're excited about the potential. But it's -- the market has been through a really major multiyear kind of reset. Jeff, do you want to give any more color on that? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. As a reminder, we wrote down a goodwill on this business over a year ago now really because the core business itself was not growing. And in fact, we're shrinking due to some of the issues we talked about previously. I think one has given us some renewed optimism about the business -- really has been some of these new launches, like the Xofigo launch that George referenced. I'd say we're hopefully optimistic now about the Nuclear business, and we see some particular product areas where there's potential to grow over time. But I would not describe the Nuclear business as one of our more significant strategic growth drivers going forward. It's good margin as long as we can continue to grow it. With these new products, it will be a good contributor to the bottom line and it is margin accretive. But it probably won't be a business that you'll hear us talk a lot about going forward. Unless, of course, some of these areas that George referenced begin to really, really take off and hopefully, they will, and we'll let you know when that happens. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And is this related to the biomarkers area? Is that where we should expect really the growth of this -- this start of the business turns around? Is that the spot you'd focus on? George S. Barrett: I think that may be an element of what we're describing. But I also think -- if I were to describe the biggest change, again, assuming that the core market is not going to go through a massive change, I think, to me, the biggest development is the potential commercialization of, let's say, 2 things. One is, if there's some real breakthroughs on the Alzheimer's side, the diagnostic piece becomes much more exciting. And the second is seeing some products that are actually not diagnostics, but are actually therapies. Those are the things that probably are most present in our mind. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And Jeff, it's been a pleasure. I wanted to shift over to Medical, where revenue came in at the high end of your low- to mid-single digit range for the year. Several med tech companies this quarter have been citing improved volumes. Your largest competitor on the acute side talked about it, one of the best environments they've seen in a while. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing within the marketplace? I know you commented briefly on it in the prepared remarks. But just curious, from a volume standpoint, demand standpoint, how that market has been trending and probably, more importantly, how you're contemplating the progression of that market into your fiscal '15 guidance? George S. Barrett: Yes, thanks. I'll take this. We've obviously heard a lot of commentary on different companies. And actually, we're hearing quite different things, and I think there's a good reason for that. I would say this. Because of our really broad reach, we have a relatively good line of sight on the system. And so what we'd say from a system perspective, utilization is somewhat flat to slight -- maybe slightly up, although I would say it's early to describe that as a trend overall. What's noteworthy, and this is why you may be hearing different perspectives, is that it's not one-size-fits-all. We are seeing some systems and some hospitals showing disproportionate growth in relation to others. And we're seeing some shift in channels, so some utilization that was, for example, happening in the acute care centers moving to ambulatory centers. And so you have this interesting dynamic, which is an overall system number, but some shifting on how and where it's done. And so that partly explains, I think, [indiscernible] you might be hearing things. We certainly believe, over the long haul, both through access to healthcare, insurance and demographics, we're going to see a lift. I would say, right now, in the short term, it's still relatively modest. Yes, I think that's the way I'd characterize it. One other thing worth noting again, which is, as we look at, for example, the hospital system, make sure we distinguish utilization from now compensation for what was uncompensated care, so there's a number of moving parts. And I would just encourage everybody to look at all the individual pieces. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on inflation, just given how important it is to the business. I know you guys guided for moderation in generic inflation for fiscal '15. But this quarter, it sounds like you said inflation was consistent. I'm just wondering, have you started to see any signs of the actual moderation in the marketplace? And George, even longer term, obviously having sat on the other side of this equation, how prolonged can this inflationary environment go in your view from a high level? I mean, are we talking quarters, are we talking multiyear? Any perspective there would actually be really helpful. George S. Barrett: Yes. Well, that's a really -- there are 2 parts to the question, and the last part is really hard to answer. I just think, historically, we see cycles. That's not unusual. The question is how long those cycles last, and they depend on a lot of different things. They depend on how many companies are beginning to resolve technical issues, which would allow them back in the market. So I think it's -- but I wish I could give you a good answer on the prognostication on that cycle. What I can say in the short term is it is pretty much, Jeff would agree, as we saw, for example, in the last... Jeffrey W. Henderson: Last quarter. George S. Barrett: Last quarter. Jeffrey W. Henderson: But it was better than what we had originally modeled for Q1. And that's the reason why we've changed our overall assessment for the year, now looking at slight inflation versus a slight deflation that we had talked about back in August. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And Jeff, I know we'll miss you. Enjoy your extra sleep time. And Mike, welcome. Welcome to the role. I'm looking forward to working with you more closely beyond just the once-a-year card [ph] at Dublin Day. So I have 2 follow-up questions. The first one is around specialty. At $5 billion run rate, based on our assumptions, I think Cardinal now accounts for about 8% of the specialty market. So can you help us better understand whether this is more concentrated around some specific drug therapies where you have higher share? And also, as we think of new drug launches in kind of like in the coming years, should we assume that you're now in a position to gain your fair share, i.e. that 8% across the different drug categories? George S. Barrett: Well, let me -- I'll start. First, let me say this. Again, I would say, I think we're well positioned. We've got significant presence across the business. I think there are always going to be individual products that are -- that have distinct service contracts. That's probably true for our competitor as well. I think we're positioned to participate in any part of this specialty area. One thing that I probably should point out, I didn't get a chance to -- or didn't in the last question related to this, is that I do think that we've done a very good job. And this may be a bit of a unique positioning for us, of -- in a world, again, where there is a lot of issue around risk management, of connecting the payer perspective with about pharma company and the patient. And I think we've worked pretty carefully at that intersection, and we've got some creative solutions. But I would say, in terms of our overall positioning, we can compete broadly. I'm not sure there is a single area where we would not play and certainly hope to take our fair share as the growth in the system continues. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just 2 follow-up questions on the numbers. So Jeff, first of all, just to clarify on your guidance regarding inflation, do you now expect additional inflation for the remainder of your fiscal year? Or is the change to your view just based on the calculated inflation that you saw in the September quarter? Jeffrey W. Henderson: It's a little of both, Ricky. Obviously, what's happened already is -- it's happened. So let's just take [ph] into the numbers. And I think what happened in Q1 slightly changed our view for the rest of the year, so it's a little of both. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then the -- you had a very nice sequential improvement in distribution operating margins. Can you just kind of like walk us through what contributed to that? I mean, obviously, Red Oak is probably part of it, but you kind of like highlighted that Red Oak was relatively modest. So is there anything else that we should be aware of? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. I think your assessment of Red Oak being relatively modest is an accurate one. It wasn't a big contributor to sequential margin expansion. I really would point to the continued strong performance of our generic portfolio overall, really independent of Red Oak. We continue to grow our sales very, very nicely. And really, all aspects of our generic program are really hitting on all cylinders, which will make the addition of the Red Oak benefits even more exciting to see as we get towards the back half of this year. I think the continued growth in specialty, Nuclear, China, all higher-margin areas have improved our mix, and that has driven sequential improvement. And then on the Medical side, obviously, having Medical grow this quarter, given there's a higher-margin part of the overall consolidated business, improves our mix as well. And I think the contribution from preferred products and services, which, as you know, are our higher-margin elements within Medical, also contributes as well. So there's no one thing I'd point to. It was really indeed the continued growth and success that a lot of our various strategic initiatives that we've been pushing for some time are continuing to drive a shift in product and customer mix that's very favorable to us. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dave Francis from RBC Capital Markets. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I'll add my congratulations and hope to see you on another trip down to Vanderbilt sometime soon. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Thanks, Dave. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : As it relates -- if I can go back to George's question earlier on Red Oak and timing of the benefits there, if I could ask a little bit differently, George, can you walk us a little bit through kind of the process for whether it's simple annual contracts being renegotiated? Or what is it in terms of the mechanics of getting the Red Oak piece up and running that allows you to so quickly recognize the benefits of that relationship, moving them into the income statement? George S. Barrett: So again, I'll try to give you some color without providing answers that would make us uncomfortable given our proprietary relationships with our suppliers. We started working on this right away, identifying the teams with a clear sense of what we wanted to do. And so in a way, it was just a discipline of putting the teams together, identifying the right talent. We've got tremendously capable people working in this and then the support of 2 companies from the back office perspective. What we had to do was to really do a full analysis of the market, every product line, every supplier, all their capacities, what their pipelines look like. And so the Red Oak team, I think, has done all of them. But I would describe it as serious analytics work to identify what the opportunities were and how to work with each manufacturer. And each of those relationships is very, very distinct, and so we work very hard at making sure that everybody feels like they're in the tent, both big companies and small. And the Red Oak teams have been having meetings, really, since early July with all those manufacturers. And so the progress has been really gratifying. I'm extremely proud of this team, but I\u2019m impressed by what I've seen. And they're working their tails off. This is incredibly hard work. As I've said, I don't think anybody can ever appreciate how many moving parts there are, how many products themselves, how many manufacturers, kind of multiple products. And so I think just doing this work and doing the analytics to support a simple program was enormous. It's hard to give more color than that, but I... David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Well, and I guess, my question is kind of more to, as you look at both your and CVS' contractual relationships with the manufacturers, it sounds like the -- just structurally speaking, things are on a relatively short calendar such that you are in a position, as a combined purchasing entity, to restructure those agreements and begin to recognize the benefits more quickly than we might've otherwise thought. Is that fair to say? George S. Barrett: I think all of us are phasing out. We get -- we all had obligations and commitments and existing product relationships. So I think that is all flowing through. And I think we can say that, as we work through the year, we'll look like, one, a sourcing entity, and I think manufacturers will see that. I do see us that way. And yes, I think we'll see the benefit as it unfolds during the year. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, if I may ask. Appreciate the color relative to your expectations on Nexium in the fiscal year. More broadly speaking, as it relates to other generic launches going forward and understanding that Nexium has some specific circumstances surrounding it, are you guys seeing anything differently from either an FDA perspective or a manufacturing perspective that might create a more drawn-out process relative to other larger products going through a generic launch process? Or is Nexium and perhaps some of the others out there that we've seen some delays where those are just one-off kind of situations. Is there some there something more endemic there? George S. Barrett: I think they're largely one-off stories. I think actually FDA has been talking about increasing their cycle times, speeding up their cycle time, so I'm not sure we're seeing an endemic situation at all. These tend to be very unique issues that may or may not have legal issues or manufacturing issues, but I think what we would say is these are largely one-off dynamics that we're describing. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink Partners. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So excluding Walgreens, the revenue growth, I think, of 13% year-over-year looks very good. Can you maybe just touch on -- in the Pharma division, we're hearing about some significant wins you're picking up. What's going on in the market that's maybe new this year versus last year? And from a Pharma Distribution point of view, what are you doing that's different than some of your competitors? George S. Barrett: Again, always a little reluctant to do a lot of comparative analysis with our competitors in this call. But here's what I'd say. I think our group has a very clear sense of how we create value. I think we become increasingly immersed in the needs of our customers, and I think we demonstrate that in a very consistent way. Again, not a comment on anyone else, I just think our team is doing an extremely good job of, I think, increasingly being recognized as a company who sort of gets it, understands the dynamics of the system as they're exchanging. And we seem to be feeling a good kind of momentum in the way that we are interacting with customers and the things that they seek from us. So it's hard to describe more than that. Other than that, I think our work is -- it's really good. I watched it very closely. For example, when I went to our RBC, our retail business conference, and I watched the kind of interaction that we're having with our customers, the kind of service offerings that we have and their response to that. Now I'd say generally, it's quite positive. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So each client is unique. Can you go the extra mile to basically meet each of those unique needs? Okay. And then just one other question. I think you said you aren't expecting any benefit from Nexium in fiscal '15. I thought that, that was going to originally launch in November of '14. So to not have any benefit for the next 3 quarters, that's a fairly conservative approach, right? Jeffrey W. Henderson: I'm not sure I'd consider it conservative. I guess, I would consider it a fairly realistic view from our standpoint of how that's going to play out. Maybe we\u2019ll be wrong, maybe it'll go earlier, but again, I'm not sure I'd necessarily characterize it as conservative. George S. Barrett: Yes. I mean, again I would say, just based on the data that we've received to date, the original expectation we had, which was late fall launch, we've taken that out of our assumption. And I think probably the more cautious assumption, as Jeff said, is appropriate. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Kreger from William Blair. Roberto Fatta : This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John today. Going back to the physician preference items that were discussed at length earlier, in the past, you guys have quantified the percent of revenue and/or earnings that these items comprise. Are you willing to quantify that today? Or perhaps what kind of growth rates you've been seeing of late? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. I'll characterize it though, not just physician preference items, but all preferred products. So in this latest quarter, preferred products made up low 20s in terms of revenue and approaching 39% in terms of percent of gross profit of the Medical segment. Roberto Fatta : Great. And secondly, on utilization, we talked a little bit about the medical utilization. Have you seen any changes in script consumption this year? George S. Barrett: Yes. I think, again, the data that we're seeing from certainly IMS and others is fairly favorable. So yes, that's probably a little bit of a different story on the drug side in terms of our overall utilization as compared to the procedural utilization we're seeing, yes. Operator : And we will go now to Steve Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And Jeff, congrats, again, on your retirement. Now I know you already discussed generic inflation a bit at this point obviously. But I guess, as we analyze this, it does seem now that generic inflation may be moving beyond just product supply shortage situations. And it seems to be happening now in a wider basket of older products. And in fact, I think some observers now suggest that maybe generic inflation on a growing number of products on the list price is actually in response to the generic procurement JVs that are being formed in the supply channel as the manufacturers try to offset some of the greater volume discounts. So I guess, I'm just kind of curious to get your thoughts on those particulars within the overall generic inflation picture. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Okay. Yes, a fair question. It's hard to know, again, the drivers for a generic inflation. I think, again, you have to remind yourself that each product is a market, its own market. And so I think, in general, what we look at when we look at products is how many players are in a market. We look at who they are and what their historical patterns are. And that's, I think, the best you can do in analyzing it, whether or not it's in relation to any consolidation of purchasing. I'm not sure I would necessarily say that's the cause because we've been seeing this kind of inflation now for a relatively extended period. So there are probably multiple factors in this. And so we tried to analyze it the best we can, but I would say multiple factors probably. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I mean, does it feel like that was evolving maybe beyond just product supply shortage situations though? Is that kind of a safe [indiscernible]? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. Well, probably yes. It probably is a little bit less debt-driven today than I might have said 1 year ago. That's fair. Operator : And we'll go now to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And Jeff, again, congrats on the retirement. And Mike, we all look forward to working with you. There's one -- to just quickly ask on specialty, to touch back on it. As you -- so thank you for the additional visibility, very much appreciate it. So now that you've reached critical mass, I'm just curious to get your view of what the specialty market growth rate as you define the basket, at what rate it's growing. And if you think the next few years that you guys can grow above or at that rate. Just any sort of visibility would be helpful. George S. Barrett: Yes. I don't know if I can actually give you the exact market growth rate because it's defined so differently. Clearly, what we're seeing as it relates to the new product flow, what's in Phase III trials, we should expect a continued growth in products that we tend to call specialty products. And we get started -- our program -- we get started very early. In drug development, we are looking at every product that's in process. We work sort of in every one of the niches in specialty. And so what I would say is, we expect significant growth in the market. I can't give you an exact number. We feel pretty confident that we will be able to grow our business consistent with that market. And again, starting from a smaller base, I think the growth rates could be a little bit more accelerated. But we're feeling very good about our positioning and our ability to compete in any one of these areas as products start to flow through the FDA and into the market. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And do you think there are any more assets that you could consider through M&A that, for any reason, didn\u2019t qualify a few years back? George S. Barrett: We've said this before. I'm not -- we continue to look. All of our strategic priorities are areas where we think we have an opportunity to really add value. And so we're doing that obviously organically in terms of our own internal work and our internal investment. But in every one of these areas, we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that we think adds strategic value and where we can execute. So we will not take our foot off the gas pedal at looking at those opportunities. As you know, they don't come up every day. And so we'll pursue this dual strategy of driving organic growth, building our capabilities, using our increasing scale and looking for opportunities externally. Operator : And we'll go now onto Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : George, just wanted to ask about the Medical segment. I think this is an area that has been a focus for you since you became CEO. And it feels like the company's been constantly investing in this area. And I would say, I think it's fair to say that the profit margins in the segment are probably not where you'd like them. And if we go back to Analyst Day, you laid out some pretty aggressive assumptions over the next several years in terms of the profit margins in that segment. So maybe could you opine on kind of where you think we are at this point and what you see as the keys to success to be able to improve the profit margins in that division? George S. Barrett: Yes. So generally, as Jeff mentioned earlier, the profit margins in that segment tend to be higher than the profit margins in our Pharma segment. So a, it is accretive to the work in our Medical business is accretive to our margin rate. Number two, we have been seeing some really encouraging work that's affecting our margins, and it really has to do with the mix of products and services that we provide, and that is a huge range of products and services. The areas that we are prioritizing tend to be areas that are actually accretive to our margin rate, and we'll continue to drive those. So we've talked about the consumables area. That's -- those are positive to us. Our growth in the direct-to-patient work that we're doing through Cardinal at Home, that is beneficial to our margin rate. Honestly, it's a midterm driver that we've talked about in terms of preferred products or physician preference items that is accretive to our margin rates. So what I would say is, these are all, for us, priorities because they're really needed, they address real pain points in the system, but they're also beneficial to us in terms of our overall mix and profit. So I'm pretty excited about the work that we're doing and the recent moves we've made, particularly to build that foundation, and the physician preference items is probably a good news story. I don't know if Jeff wants to add. Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. I mean, the goal we gave in Investor Day last December was to achieve a 5.75% operating margin or segment profit margin in Medical in FY '17. And I would say, we've taken the steps to remain on track to achieve that. It's not going to be one smooth ride, right? It's going to be quarters where we need to invest to accelerate certain areas. And there will always be certain parts of the business that may have a blip. In this particular quarter, again, that was probably our blip from an operating perspective given the marketing -- or the market conditions there. But the general trajectory we're on remains on target for the 5.75% that we set for ourself. George S. Barrett: Okay. And maybe if I can just follow up with one question on the Pharmaceutical segment. Jeff, I jumped on the call late, but I thought I heard you say within your prepared remarks that, that segment benefited from a resolution of some long-standing customer issues of about $20 million. Was that a one-time event in this quarter? And could you maybe give a little bit more color and clarity what that was about? Jeffrey W. Henderson: Yes. I would describe it as -- well, first of all, we're always resolving customer issues, right, that's between us and our customers, disputes, et cetera, that need to be resolved over time. This particular one in Q1 was relatively large, approximately $20 million, so I'd describe it is one-time-ish given the size of it. And all I'll say about it is, for some time now, we've had certain issues that ultimately got resolved in the quarter. And as a result of that, we were able to pull it through to the bottom line. Operator : And we will take our final question today from David Toung from Argus Research. David H. Toung - Argus Research Company : My question is about the physician preference items. And I think, Jeff and George, you talked about investing in it, and you're expecting some better contribution in the back half of the year. Can you just talk a little bit more about these investments and sort of what is it? Is it on the clinical side or is it on the marketing side? And also, if you could just address sort of the customer uptake of these physician preference items or -- I'm not sure. Is it preference items or is it medical devices? George S. Barrett: So let me do a little defining. These physician preference items are medical devices, so it's just a subset of medical devices, David. So largely, the investment is in a couple of areas : building out the infrastructure and sales force, make sure that we can do what we need to do to get the products in and out of the system. We had some development costs. These are not what I would call research costs in the classic sense. These are more sort of development, making sure that the product line is positioned the way we want. And so for example, just expanding that emerged product line requires some costs. We've got launch activities associated with some of these wound management products. So I think we're a little bit in that stage, but we're pretty excited about the flow of products. And I would say, the customer response is very positive right now. And as Jeff said, we're looking towards the back half with some greater sense of enthusiasm about the flow. David H. Toung - Argus Research Company : Sure, that's great. Yes, did you have more to say? George S. Barrett: I'm sorry? David H. Toung - Argus Research Company : Did you have more? George S. Barrett: Yes. Just one piece I would add. Since the AccessClosure acquisition has occurred, I would say that the uptake on the product line coming out of AccessClosure has actually been very positive. So again, it's early on negative pressure wound, ortho is just building, but I would say, on that cardio, it's already beginning to show some good results. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the conference over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett: Well, listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us in what I know is a really busy day for all of you, and it's a bit of a long call. So thanks, again, for your time, and we'll see you all very soon. Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference, and we do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George Barrett : Thanks Sally. Good morning everyone and thanks to all of you for joining us on our second quarter call. I am pleased to report a very strong second quarter, bringing to completion an excellent first half of fiscal 2015. I'd like to take a moment to welcome Mike Kaufmann to his first quarterly earnings call as the CFO of Cardinal Health. Mike and Jack have worked closely during the transition and I appreciate their collaboration. Mike brings tremendous operating experience to our financial team and has adjusted quickly to his new role. Total revenues for the second quarter were $25.5 billion, an increase of 15% versus last year second quarter. We were pleased to see sales growth from both existing and new customers. Our second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20, up 33% from last year's $0.90. Remember that our same quarter last year included a $0.16 expense related to a tax item. When we adjust for tax item, our second quarter FY15 non-GAAP diluted EPS increased by a robust 13%. At the same time we returned $438 million to our shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends during the second quarter bringing the total amount returned to our shareholders for the first half of the fiscal year to over $900 million. Based on our results for the first half of fiscal 2015 and our perspective on the back half of the year, we are now raising our guidance to a full year EPS range of $4.28 to $4.38. As I typically do, I'll provide some color on the segments, but before I do that I'd to offer a slightly different perspective on being Cardinal Health. Our health system is going through significant changes, not the least of which is a continued blurring of the lines between healthcare players and channels. Our approach to addressing the market has been aligned to this trend, bringing the full range of Cardinal Health capabilities in a holistic framework to address the needs of these increasingly integrated customers. With this as a backdrop, I'll speak about the segments, but please recognize that in many instances we are going to the market not as a Pharmaceutical segment, not as a Medical segment, but as Cardinal Health, an integrated source of strategic solutions and the creation of our strategic account teams will only expand this enterprise wide effort. Now to the segments, first our Pharmaceutical segment. Second quarter Pharmaceutical segment revenue was very strong. Sales for the quarter were $22.6 billion, an increase of 16% over the prior year, showing positive signs in nearly all of our business lines and in all classes of trade. Our organization has been unwavering in its commitment to ensure that our customers see us not only as extraordinarily reliable, but also able to help them adapt to the changes in the system. A couple of notes here on revenues. On a year-over-year basis we were pleased to pick up some new business crossing all classes of trade, but including one larger mail order customer, which as you know historically contributes to our margin rates. And as many of you know, the treatment of hepatitis C has evolved into a major therapeutic class, and one which has changed dramatically over this past year. The distribution of these products contributed meaningfully to our revenue growth, but has a dilutive effect on our margin rates. The overall performance of our generic programs remains strong and Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with CVS Health is clearly an important strategic initiative for us. We are increasingly excited about this partnership, and are very pleased about the way our collective talent has fully integrated as one team. They've been working hard to make sure that our supplier partners feel that they are part of something that creates value for all stakeholders. We feel confident that the Red Oak model was designed thoughtfully and built to prioritize execution and simplicity and I can report at this stage, we\u2019re tracking somewhat ahead of our plan to transition manufacturers to the Red Oak program. Of course sourcing product is only half the story. We have seen continued growth in our base of customers and increasing number of home source generics from us, and our range of products and services continues to attract pharmacy customers. Our specialty solutions organization continues its track record of excellent revenue growth. You will remember from our last earnings call that we expect sales for this unit to attract $5 billion for the year and we are increasingly confident that we will exceed that number for our fiscal year. We continue to look for opportunities to expand or reach to a broader range of therapeutic areas. We have positioned our specialty business at the nexus of biopharma, payer, provider and patient. We\u2019re committed to keeping the patient at the center of our strategy and our enhanced patient access and support reinforces that focus. Upstream we continue to look to look for opportunities to broaden our pharmaceutical and biotech relationships and to expand the tools we offer these partners who serve unique patient population. So next one Medical segment. We reported revenues for the quarter of $2.9 billion, an increase of 4% versus prior year. Our Medical segments top-line was driven by recent acquisitions and growth in existing customers. Our profits were affected by continued challenges in Canada and the year-over-year customer loss in surgical kitting referred to in our calls. One important financial note, our Medical segment profits were significantly impacted this quarter by increased incentive compensation, a byproduct of raising our enterprise wide forecast and the Company expenses to the segment. Having said this, our strategic initiatives in the Medical segment continue to send positive signals, each of which is critical to our overall positioning. We\u2019ve spoken consistently about the movement of care migrating into more ambulatory settings. Our collaboration with Henry Schein addresses an important link in the chain as we serve highly integrated health systems, whose networks now include many smaller physician practices as well as independent practices. Combining Henry Schein\u2019s logistics and service capabilities with Cardinal Health's strength in other channels will enable us to serve these customers more efficiently while increasing the flow of Cardinal Health products into these new channels. The partnership is off to a good start. Meetings with our two sale organizations have gone well and they're working hard on the implementation of the integrated selling effort. We\u2019ve made our first customer presentations as a combined selling organization and here at Cardinal Health we\u2019ve seen our first orders for products destined for these new channels. Consistent with our perspective that care will increasingly be delivered in different settings, we continue to be really excited about our work in the home. Cardinal Health at Home continues to deliver good growth. Our direct-to-patient business Edgepark continues to grow at double-digit rates. We\u2019ve have been introducing Cardinal Health branded products into this channel. Specifically we would expect that by the end of fiscal 2015 to have launched over 100 new products through this platform, primarily in the areas of wound care and in continents. Our strategy around private label consumables and physician preference items is aligned to address an important need in the system tackling the inefficiency associated with the proliferation of products and need for standardization. Building scale reducing variability, improving outcomes while reducing cost, this is at the heart of our strategy. Specifically in the trauma area, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in building out our product-line, helped by the acquisition of Emerge Medical. We expect to be able to offer a reasonably full line of trauma products by early next year. At the same time we have trained over 200 residents on orthopedic trauma using the Cardinal Health trauma products. In wound management we've made a strong commitment to negative pressure wound therapy, and we're in the process of launching 25 SKUs in this area. As is true with all of our products, the introduction of a wound care portfolio leverages our channel reach to create an integrated wound care solution that stretches across the continuum of care. Finally at interventional cardiology our AccessClosure acquisition is going extremely well. Some recent new sales on closure devices in our strategic account is an encouraging sign as it relates to the power of combining AccessClosure's product line and the breadth of our customer relationships. Further on the technical side our MynxGrip is now the only closure device in the U.S. indicated for venous closure. Finally China continues to execute well against our plan with very robust double-digit sales growth. As you know, our development in China has been thoughtful and purposeful, built on a foundation of service, integrity and compliance as a key differentiator. Our balance sheet remains strong and we will not be shy about deploying capital to achieve best sustainable competitive positions in strategically important areas. Having said this we will continue to be both focused and disciplined in our deployment of capital, using partnerships to strengthen our position where that's more efficient, Red Oak and Henry Schein being two recent examples. Let me conclude my comments by offering this perspective. This remains an exciting time to be in healthcare and our organization is aligned with the important trends which are shaping our new landscape. But we're also an organization committed to disciplined execution in a business that demands great attention to detail. Over the past 18 months our pharmaceutical segment has come to a critical transition, repositioning its customer base and dramatically improving its tools and has emerged stronger than ever. Our medical segment is going through its own transition moving from an organization focused on med/surge distribution to an organization which creates value in new ways for customers with new needs. It is also a segment which contains many important mid and long-term drivers of growth. In summary it seems clear that growth will be driven by demographics, by more Americans having health coverage in some form, that care will continued to be delivered in new settings and at times by different care givers. Consumers will be more actively involved in their own care. Pharmaceutical innovation will continue to create treatments and in some cases cures for life's most threatening diseases. Those who bring tools help manage the quality and the cost of care will be winners, and the efficiency created by scale will be valuable. We bring these things and we are increasingly aware that we have a unique position in the marketplace. It's difficult to find another Company with this kind of reach across the system and we are committed to bringing an increasingly integrated marketplace solutions across traditional lines. This is central to our competitive advantage. And with that I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks George and good morning everyone. Before we get into the earnings discussion, I just want to say that it has been an exciting few months for me since becoming CFO. I've enjoyed not only leading the Cardinal Health finance team but also meeting with many of you, our investors and analysts. For those of you I have not met, I look forward to speaking with you soon. Now on to the quarter. As George mentioned, we are happy to report strong financial performance this quarter, and to be raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance. I will first walk through the drivers for the quarter's financial performance and then provide some insight into our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our Web site as a guide to this discussion. I will start by talking about consolidated results and then go into more detail in my segment discussions. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.20, an increase of 33% versus the prior year. As a reminder the prior year quarter includes a $0.16 charge related to a tax item. Eliminating this item non-GAAP EPS grew 13% year-over-year. Again this quarter revenues exceeded our expectations up 15% to $25.5 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 8% for the quarter but the rate was compressed a bit largely because of Hepatitis C therapies launched within the last year and some shift in the margin rates related to the recent expansion of our customer base. Total SG&A increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions. Consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings were up over 10% to $639 million or a non-GAAP operating margin rate of 2.5%. In the quarter net interest and other expense was $7 million higher, due in large part to the timing of various components of the long-term debt refinancing we completed during the quarter. On tax, as we have said in the past, our non-GAAP effective tax rate can fluctuate quarterly due to changes in international and U.S. state effective tax rate resulting from our business mix and discreet items. This is why we only provide annual tax rate guidance. You will notice that for the first-half of this fiscal year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 35%. We still expect our full year tax rate to be 36% to 37%, which implies a higher tax rate in the second half of this fiscal year. Our second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $334 million, 12 million shares favorable to the prior year\u2019s quarter. During Q2, we repurchased $324 million worth of shares leaving about $1 billion of share purchase authorization remaining under our Board approval. To complete my review of the consolidated numbers, let's move to the consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. We generated a robust $953 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. As a reminder, operating cash flow was Q1 was light, which was largely just a function of timing and we expected some shift between quarters. At the end of the second quarter, we had cash on our balance sheet of $2.9 billion, which includes $448 million held internationally. Our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to deploy capital in the most efficient way to return value to shareholders and to drive sustainable growth. Speaking of capital deployment, as Pharmaceutical segment CEO, I was part of our capital committee and actively involved in all major deployment decisions. You should expect that our strategies around capital deployment will remain intact. Now let me take a moment to reiterate these priorities. First, we are committed to investing in activities that reinforce the sustained strength of our core businesses. Next, we remain committed to our differentiated dividend that we expect to grow at least in line with our long-term non-GAAP earnings growth rate. Third, we will not be hesitant to deploy capital for acquisitions which further strengthen our businesses and best position us for leadership in this evolving environment. We\u2019ve thought pretty consistently about our strategic priorities and these will of course be the areas where we will devote the most attention as we consider inorganic moves. And as we\u2019ve done in the past, we will continue to consider share repurchases. This fiscal year, we have repurchased $684 million worth of shares. Now let's move to segment performance, starting with pharma. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 16% to $22.6 billion, driven by growth in our base of existing customers, as well as the impact of new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 12% to $542 million, due to strong performance under generic programs, which includes the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing. Also our profit was positively impacted by continued growth from existing customers, as well as growth from new customers. The Pharmaceutical segment profit margin rate decreased 9 basis points, impacted by customer pricing changes, newly launch hepatitis C pharmaceutical products and the impact of new customers. These were partially offset by strong performance from generic programs which again include the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing. The branded hepatitis C therapies launched within the last year have been a topic of great interest in healthcare. Just to be clear, for Cardinal Health, these sales contribute to top-line growth but the overall impact is dilutive to margin rates. Additionally as a reminder, these products are recorded within the pharmaceutical distribution results, not our Specialty sales. With respect to our generic programs, we saw strong unit growth this quarter. Also, as projected Red Oak Sourcing was accretive in the quarter, net of the $25.6 million payment we made to CVS Health. As a Board member of Red Oak, I continue to be impressed with the efficiency and speed at which the Red Oak team has executed. They have now transitioned suppliers representing greater than 95% of the total generic spend. For the quarter, as it relates to the impact of generic manufacturer price increases, we did see a slight year-over-year decrease in contribution. Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. Revenue for the Medical segment increased 4% to $2.9 billion, driven by acquisitions and growth from existing customers. Medical segment profit decreased 12% to $115 million, with the largest negative driver being a year-over-year increase in enterprise wide incentive compensation, as well as the continued impact of market pressures in Canada and the related repositioning of that business. These factors also drove the Medical segment profit margin rate this quarter, which decreased by 73 basis points. Since the performance our Canadian unit has been a challenge over the last nine months, let me take a moment to discuss it. I recently met with the Canadian team and left impressed with the new team members, the optimism of the entire team, their pipeline and their strategic plan, which includes accelerated movement of Cardinal Health branded products. We should see some recovery in that business starting later this calendar year. While there have been challenges in certain discreet areas, the medical segment continues to execute against the strategic priorities. For example, within our strategic hospital accounts, we continued to achieve organic growth of more than 5% versus the prior year quarter. This remains a key area of focus, as we demonstrate to the large integrated health systems that we create enterprise solutions to address the challenges they face. Now I'd like to give you my observations on our Medical segment, not only from my new CFO seat, but also from my experience as CEO of the Pharmaceutical segment and President of the Medical business some seven years ago. As George mentioned, medical has been going through a critical transition. I'm particularly aware of this as I compare our profit drivers today to what they were seven years ago. Over this time the profit pools have shifted and under Don's leadership the team has adapted and made tough decisions to invest in certain key priorities while reducing emphasis and investment in others. Our medical team has built new capabilities and made the moves necessary to reposition the segment to create more value per customers and partners and to participate in new profit pools going forward. Before we move on, I'd like to briefly tough on what we are seeing around commodities as this has been top of mind for many of you. For FY15, as we previously said due to the time lag within our supply chain we only expect to see very slight benefit and that is included in our updated guidance range. Now while it is very early, I just want to give you my preliminary observations regarding FY16. We're continually updating our commodities forecast, including analyzing them based on forward curves. Our most recent analysis indicates there will be a modest benefit of $10 million to $20 million in fiscal '16. For those of you who remember commodities being a large headwind some years ago, this may seem low. While there are several factors causing this, let me touch on two of them. First over the past few years the prices of inputs to our Cardinal Health brand products no longer move in tandem with crude oil prices. Second, since we experienced significant commodity exposures in the past, we have worked to temper these through strategic and operational measures we have taken with our suppliers. Any updated estimates would be included in the FY16 guidance that we typically provide on our Q4 call. Now turning to Slide No. 6, you will see our reconciliation of consolidated GAAP results to non-GAAP for the quarter. The $0.34 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by litigation expenses, amortization and other acquisition related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. You will see on the schedule that the net of tax impact of the debt redemption resulted in a $37 million GAAP expense. Let me begin to wrap up with a brief discussion on the remainder of FY15. Based on our strong first half performance, and helped a bit by the lower tax rate in Q2, we are increasing and tightening our overall FY15 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.28 to $4.38 from the prior range of $4.10 to $4.30. A few comments about the new guidance range, what we've realized today and what we are assuming. Based on the overall revenue growth fiscal year to date, we are updating our total company revenue guidance from up modestly compared to FY14 to now expecting the full year revenue growth to be in the high single-digits. As for each segment, we continue to expect our Medical segment revenue growth to be as originally provided, low to mid single-digit growth versus FY14. And following two quarters of strong growth, we now expect the full year Pharma segment revenue growth will be in the high single to low double-digit range compared to the prior year. With respect to Red Oak, as George mentioned, the transition of the manufacturers to the Red Oak program have been a little faster than our previously discussed expectation. It is too early to comment on the timing, sequencing or impact around the possible Nexium launch, and so we have not included this in our updated guidance. There are multiple variables that are still up in the air including legal maneuvers, the timing of launches, capacity and the number of other companies who could potentially launch. When the facts become clearer we will evaluate its impact on our new guidance. Also it is worth mentioning that our assumptions around branded and generic inflation have not changed. We still expect branded inflation to be about the same as fiscal \u201914 in the low double-digits and across our generic portfolio, while we still expect slight inflation, we have modeled the overall benefits to moderate in our second half versus what we experienced in the first-half. Our guidance range also assumes that our head wind we\u2019ve experienced in Canada year-to-date will carry through the remainder of the fiscal year. Looking at our corporate assumptions, our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 36% to 37% remains unchanged, which as I mentioned previously implies a higher tax rate during the second half of this fiscal year. We are slightly reducing our interest at other range to $135 million to $145 million. We are also lowering our diluted weighted average shares outstanding range to 336 million to 337 million shares. We are modifying our capital expenditure guidance to $340 million to $350 million, and finally our amortization slightly increased, based on the few previously mentioned small acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in the first-half of the fiscal year. In summary, we are really pleased with the progress we have made in the first-half of fiscal \u201915 and expect similar execution in the back half of the year. So with one quarter under my belt as the new CFO, I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming weeks and months. Operator let's begin our Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Bob Jones : I seem to have couple of on Medical, trying to calibrate things here. I know you guys had mentioned incentive comp as a headwind in the quarter. Could you maybe just give us a sense of what the margin in Medical would have been of you adjust for incentive comp year-over-year? Mike Kaufmann : This is Mike and thanks for the question. Really can\u2019t go into details of what it would be adjusted, but I will give you a little color in that the majority of the comp that you saw pushed out into the Medical segment was in the area of 401(k) and that\u2019s because that\u2019s based on employees and as you know, a significant portion of our employees are in the Medical segment. Bob Jones : That's helpful. I guess just one big question around that then is as we think about where we are today in Medical on the margins, and moving towards at some point that long-term goal of 5.75%, just wondering if you can maybe help us think about the path to get there? And then if I could just sneak in one specific one, Mike, on the commodities. I believe you said it was a tail wind of $10 million to $20 million for next year. If I go back and look at your 10-K filing, it looks like the impact from a 10% move and the example you gave in your slides would have resulted in about a 30 million impact. I'm wondering if there was some changing [ph] in hedging between June and today. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for those questions. I\u2019ll talk about the commodities first and then I can go back to giving you a little bit more color on medical margins or George can do that. And as far as the commodities go, remember a couple of different things. First of all as I said, which is really most important, what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is all of the components of our -- of the items that make up commodities for us, they do not really track in tandem with crude oil prices anymore. While historically several years ago you would see that for the most part, you don\u2019t see that any more. So that\u2019s a really big driver for us as we track both current and future rates on commodities. Also -- you also know that when we did have those significant issues in the past, as you could imagine we took a look at our contracts with our manufacturers and really focused on trying to rework those contracts and relationships with the manufacturers, so that we would not see these types of ups or downs going forward in the future. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s probably tempering your estimates of the numbers. George Barrett : And Bob if I can -- its George -- maybe just touch base a little bit on the drivers as it relates to the goal of expanding margins in Medical. Let me just carve them out. Key growth areas will be the services around our distribution platform. So the traditional supply chain activities are now a much broader range of services that we\u2019re beginning to offer. Those typically carry higher margin. Growth in our consumables, particularly our private label consumables, our physician preference items, I talked about wound management, I talk about interventional cardiology, I talk about trauma. Growth in these are higher margins. Growth in the Home is important to us. Again this is an area where we\u2019ve seen excellent growth and expansion of margins. So the overall positioning of these activities really drives mix. Again I think remember, for example private label products now being driven in through our home strategy. So these are all expansive to margins. And then finally positioning with the key accounts in the system. So it's really -- a large component of that is both mix of product line and in some degree mix of customers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee : Maybe if I can follow up on Bob's question, and maybe ask in a little different way. If we were to exclude the Canadian business out of the Medical segment, can you kind of give us sense on how that is performing over the last couple of quarters? Margin improvement and -- as you have been pushing out preferred products and the physician preference items? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I can appreciate the question but I really don't want to go into that level of detail on it. Again there are a couple of discrete items that we mentioned. It's really the Canadian business that is a big factor and a pushdown of compensation are really driving the Medical segment year-over-year negative performance. Charles Rhyee : Then maybe on the Canadian side, you talked about meeting with the team and you said you like the strategy they're kind of playing out to you. Can you maybe give us a little bit more details on how you guys are planning to tackle some of the issues here? I know you talked about more Cardinal branded products. But what is specifically there that we can hope to kind of get around some of the issues? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for that question. I did get a chance to actually go up there and spend some time with the team and I've had some involvement over the years with them. I think a couple of things on their mind. First of all as I mentioned, focusing on shifting where possible our Cardinal branded products, that's a big important piece. One other thing to remember is we are really the only distributor up there in the med/surge area that has reach of the entire -- of all of Canada. And so I think the team has done some really good things around leveraging our supply chain to be able to work with manufacturers to drive more opportunities up there. They're also as you can imagine looking aggressively at their cost structure and they're doing things with their management team and I've really liked where they have been able to bring some new blood into some really talented folks that are looking at the business differently. In fact I know our new CFO up there really came from one of our customers up there and really understands the business and is going to bring some new ideas to the table. George Barrett : This is George. I might just want to add something to sort of back to where you started. We're not going to start to break out and pull out the pieces of the [indiscernible] business on medical, but I would probably offer this. When we look at our all of our strategic priorities, and we're doing pretty consistent metrics around our medical business, we actually see some very good signs, and it's actually been an operating according to our internal forecast. So our growth is strategic, accounts is good, consumables growth is good. The physician preference item strategy as we've told you is sort of a more mid-term driver of the business, but we actually like some of the underlying characteristics that we've seeing. We have seen over the years that traditional med/surge distribution has seen some pricing pressure over the years. But that's something that we anticipate and expect and we like the growth that we're seeing in the home. So when we look at the components that are making up this segment, we really like the way the pieces are going. Again we're going to have to absorb the changes that we saw in this Canadian mark and I think we'll also lap this -- part of it with the market change that we had to deal with. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen Santangelo : George, I just want to follow up on some of the commentary around generic price inflation. I think you seemed to suggest that maybe you saw slightly better inflation on generics sort of year-over-year. But I think you're moderating your assumptions in the second half of the fiscal year versus the first half. Are you kind of implying that maybe some of that was pulled forward? Could you maybe just flesh out a little bit more what you're seeing in the marketplace and how we should think about the trends? George Barrett : Glenn, let me start and then I'll be happy to have Mike chime in and he's obviously been very close to it from his prior role. When we talk about moderating for the back half of the year, it's largely just a model at this point. We don't have perfect transparency on pricing. We have historical models. We do the best we can to use those to guide us going forward. We have in the interactions with the suppliers. But there is not something absolutely discrete perfect trend line that tells us what to do. We just thought the numbers in the first half were reasonably strong. And so what we did was we just moderated that somewhat in the second half, and that's the way to approached. But it's difficult to come to us a perfect number on this. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I can just add a little bit of color. So as I did mention, for the quarter as it relates to generic inflation, this quarter was slightly less than last year's quarter, as there was a year-over-year decrease in the contribution. As far as Q1 versus Q2, Q1 was a little stronger than Q2 in terms of rate. And you were right, you did hear me right. We do expect the second half of the year total generic inflation contribution to our bottom line will be moderated compared to the first half of the fiscal year. Glen Santangelo : Maybe if I could just follow up on capital deployment. George, you said all along that your preference is clearly to do strategic M&A versus share repurchase, but here we are halfway through the fiscal year and you\u2019ve kind of already blown through your share repurchase target. Should we sort of read into that, that maybe you don\u2019t see anything on the strategic M&A front that interests you, or maybe if you can just give us an update there on how we should think about capital deployment through the balance of the fiscal year, given where the leverage sits on the balance sheet? George Barrett : Thanks, Glen. No, I don\u2019t think you should read and anything into it actually. We are always looking at the most efficient way to create a great position for strategic growth. And there are moments where those opportunities are right in front of you and there are moments where they are not, but I don\u2019t think I would read into it. We\u2019ve done a small -- a couple of small moves in the physician preference item area over the last year -- last few months. And we\u2019re always actively looking. It's just a matter of finding that opportunity you think drives the value you want and you have to have someone there decide really to do it at that moment. But I don\u2019t think I would read anything into it. Mike Kaufmann : We\u2019ll continue to opportunistic where it makes sense on the share repo, but I guess -- maybe the only other thing you could read into is that we\u2019re being disciplined and we\u2019re going to make sure we pick the things that match to our strategic priorities and are at the right price. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Maybe, Mike, quickly on generic inflation, when you talk about the decreasing impact year-over-year, should we think about the decreasing impact as lower sell side margin contribution on higher generic drug prices or should we think about kind of lower carry on inventory that inflates? What's the right way to think about the contribution there? Mike Kaufmann : I really don\u2019t think I can go into a lot of detail on that. Let's see if I can help a little bit. As you know there are different ways you can make money on generics. There is obviously the difference between what you sell it at and what you buy at. So we\u2019re always focused on that. And then obviously there is the appreciation on inventory when you have -- do have price increases. So there are a lot of different components including how you price, penetrating current customers, et cetera that improve our programs and drive margin. So to be specific how any one single margin bucket works would be difficult. And obviously our manufacturer contracts and discussions are incredibly confidential and competitive. George Barrett : I guess some -- I want to make sure I understood the question George. I don\u2019t think there is anything mechanical that we\u2019re highlighting here. It's just the overall pricing environment. So I don\u2019t think that we can -- if that\u2019s a question it's a not a unique mechanical dynamic. I think Mike's just describing the overall pricing trend. George Hill : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just kind of a quick follow-up on the Medical segment again. Just -- I don\u2019t know -- I'm wondering is there any more color you can give us on kind of what would drive the rapid increase in the 401(k) contributions in that segment of the business compared to other segments? Mike Kaufmann : So the best way to think about it is, is the way we look at compensation. We look at it is all of Cardinal. And so when there is overall performance from the business, then one of the biggest pieces that get funded first is our 401(k) program. And we don\u2019t distinguish between our employees on whether they're in the M or the P segment when overall cardinal health is performing. And so since we had a strong first-half, it caused us per our internal guidelines to increase our accruals on our 401(k) and knowing that a significant portion of our employees are in the Medical segment, then those costs just get allocated to the Medical segment for the employees and their 401(k) contribution. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen : Hey, can you guys talk a little bit more about the operating margin in the Pharma division. So I think you called out a couple of things; pricing, new customers and Hep C. So, margin I think decline by about 8 basis points year-over-year. Can you just give any more color on sort of what the -- like the size -- the buckets for each of those items that you called out and which ones have greatest impact? Mike Kaufmann : I did get into a kind of detail, but clearly those were the two largest -- over 9 basis points of decline in margin rate and the two biggest drivers were just some new customers that we mentioned. As George mentioned we had one large mail order customer that tends to come in at lower margin rates. And then as I think you\u2019ve seen from a lot of folks in the industry, the hepatitis C drugs have been doing very well. This is really important drug class and we too have seen significant sales of those drugs in our business. And because they come in at much lower margin rates than typical our average, they are lowering our overall margin rate. David Larsen : So you obviously saw a good growth year-over-year in terms of dollars, I think up 12% year-over-year. So the mail order customer, such a new customer that came in at lower margins as a percentage of revenue? Is that correct? It wasn\u2019t a shift just to mail? And then obviously the Hep C is new revenue at a lower margin rate, right? Is that correct? Mike Kaufmann : That\u2019s right. It's a new customer, that again being newer [ph] is mostly brand business and so it comes in at lower margin rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I had a question about the Hep C -- the Hep C product as a percentage of your total sales. Could you provide a little bit more color on that? Mike Kaufmann : Sure, our Hep C drugs as a percentage of our total Pharma segment revenues is less than 25%. Elizabeth Anderson : Okay. And in addition, I was just wondering if you could give some additional color on the early wins and challenges from Red Oak? I know you said that you have sort of 90% of first 5% of contracts. But I was just wondering if there are any more specifics you could give us on that? Mike Kaufmann : Sure, let me just make sure on that, first one. Just to make sure I got it right. It's less than 25% of our growth, not less than 25% of our volume of drug spend. So just to be clear, the Hep C drugs were less than 25% of our overall growth for the quarter. And then as far as Red Oak goes, I guess all I can add to it is, I just continue to be impressed with the team. The leaders there, the executive team has done an excellent job of really blending together the employee bases. You could go there, and I think George has mentioned this the past [indiscernible] is some situation, you really can't tell who CVS or a Cardinal employee was, who came from the outside? And when I was at our Board meeting just recently, a lot of the executive management said the same thing, that they're having to remind themselves some of new people who came from where. So I think from a culture standpoint that's really important. And then also -- that's been really exiting is we were able to get all the people we wanted to transfer to go there. So all the key folks from CVS moved over there, as well as the key folks from Cardinal. And that really helped us get a really quick start, because we weren't training anybody. We had literally experts who have had decades and decades of experience in the generic business move straight over to Red Oak. So that's been positive. So again culture is going well, discussions with the manufacturers have gone well, and as I said we're at above 95% of the manufacturers moved over. So let me ask George to add couple comments. George Barrett : Just one additional thing, because you asked about challenges. We were very focused on simplicity, and speed and clarity for the manufacturers. So one of the biggest challenges, it's an incredibly complicated system, but if you look at all of generics and trying to do all the trade terms and conditions with every manufacturer. So as Mike said getting through this many, given the complexity and then trying to come out with a program, that was really straight forward and simple, was a great challenge and I think the team did an amazing job of doing that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : A couple of follow up questions here. First of all on the top line growth. Mike, I think you mentioned that Hep C was less than a quarter of growth, that's about 3% contributions. So when we parse out [indiscernible] the new customer is in the Hep C, what percent of growth do you think is Cardinal specific versus just overall market growth? Mike Kaufmann : I can't get into real specifics, but I would tell you that we all I think have seen if you're -- we've all looked at IMS data. We've seen some really strong comparatively to the past numbers from IMS, in around that 1% to 4% range. Specifically over the last several months we've seen strong growth there. So that's obviously a contributor to our top line growth. But breaking it down between what's industry growth, how much is new customers, how much is existing, how much, because you have brands moving to generics et cetera, it would be really tough to parse all of that out. And then there is also lot of other things going on in the environment. George Barrett : Ricky I want to make sure I understand your question, but again in general terms, our prescription growth was very good. As Mike said our unit growth in generics was very good, our positioning in the market was very good. And again the IMS data, last time it was 3 point something. So there is clearly some demand growth which is good in the system. Our position in the market is good. And so that is a good combination. So I'm not sure if you're asking about Hep C and whether we're disproportionately, and I was trying to make sure I understood that question. But I say again, for us think about it just, we've got a base of customers. Those Hep C products flow through different channels and we're present in all those channels. Ricky Goldwasser : I'm actually trying to understand what growth is, when you normalize for Hep C, right, assuming that over time will actually settle down? Mike Kaufmann : I don't think we'd probably take any piece of business out of our business and say that's normal. I think this is now part of the base of the business. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then on Red Oak, you said that 90% 95% [indiscernible] over. So when we think about kind of the contribution that flows through your P&L, how far are you in the ramp in the generic stage? Is what we've seen this quarter and we take that and annualize it for the reminder of the year or should we see sequential improvement over the next four quarters? Mike Kaufmann : Ricky we're having a little bit of difficulty hearing you. If I got it right, as George mentioned I think I emphasized as we did see a ramp faster in this quarter than we had originally expected. So I guess I would tell you that. Now to try to describe with Q3 and Q4, we obviously still expect some ramp in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year because every day we're signing up new vendors and transitioning suppliers, but obviously with 95% of them already moved over to the new contracting, you're getting close to where you could take Q2 and you're going to see it again ramp up over the next couple of quarters. George Barrett : Again this is all built into the guidance. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : George, just following up on thinking about Red Oak and your opportunities with share existing customers, can you maybe talk about the Greenfield opportunity for customers that source generic products from Cardinal? George Barrett : Yes, good morning Lisa. Yes, look we believe that we\u2019ve got a unique model here and a terrific partner we're really excited with flowing, and I think as we look at the overall market of those who buy generics, we have started to see a little bit of change as companies start to consider the most effective way for them to source their products. Some companies who historically have sourced those products directly are reevaluating whether that\u2019s the most effective tool for them and I think in some cases we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate to those customers that we\u2019re a very attractive alternative as Cardinal Health. So it's hard to size that opportunity for you, but I would say it's pretty clear that there are existing players out there who today are still trying to -- I am sure evaluate the most effective way for them to source products. We think we\u2019re very attractive supplier to those and we have picked up some business in this area, and I think those are encouraging signs. Lisa Gill : Is there -- asking it the other way, is there a number that you can give us as far as your existing customers that source and buy generics through you today? Is it greater than 50%, is it 90%? Just trying to get some idea of just even in your existing customer base, what the Greenfield opportunity is? George Barrett : Yes, we would be able to give you that exact percent. I would tell you that every customer buys at least some generics from us. It's just whether -- what percentage of the generic spend they buy from us. Sometimes it\u2019s in a backup position or in other times they'll buy a 100% from us. So, I would tell you that we still have opportunity to be able to do that -- to grow that going forward and -- but we\u2019ve done a great job historically in penetrating a lot of the change, independence and even our hospital class of trade on their solid orals [ph]. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher : Maybe I\u2019ll start by following up. You just mentioned you\u2019ve been able to penetrate even independents in hospitals. I'm curious, you\u2019ve brought on a mail customer recently that you spoke of, that is probably quite a bit smaller than your sourcing program when it comes to purchasing. So is there a value proposition even where you wouldn\u2019t be taking over the fulfilment of the products? George Barrett : Yes, absolutely. We think we offer really great solutions Eric, not only in terms of the potential to save money in terms of cost, but also in the terms of our quality of the products, the supply, the way we work with the customer. And so, we\u2019ve a lot of components of our program that we\u2019re going to work with each customer. Now that being said, I can\u2019t speak for any of one individual customer and they may have various reasons why they may choose or not choose sourcing from us, but we think we have as competitive or more competitive a program than anybody else. I'm out there and then we do see opportunities going forward or working with our various customers who are not buying a 100% of the generics from us. Eric Percher : And then my follow-up would be on Canada, and you may have covered this when we first started talking about the issue, can you just remind me in simple terms what the issue has been? Is it competition, volume, pricing related? What is that work there? George Barrett : Yes, it's been a couple of things. Generally overall I would just say it's really market pressures, and those market pressures, a lot related to reimbursement in the environment have driven a lot of behaviors as you could imagine, less purchases of capital equipment, utilization, all those types of things, pricing pressure is on there. So it's really reimbursement pressures in the market have put a lot of pressure on that business and it has forced them to relook at their model and work with their customers in different ways. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : George could you give us an update on how the China business is doing and what aspects of that business are gaining the most traction? George Barrett : Yes, it's going well. We mentioned that we had significant double-digit growth again in China. All the components of business are growing. Our distribution platform continues to expand. We have continued to provide some wrap around services with those customers, building out those capabilities, more marketing presence, which has I think been an exciting potential. Our geographic reach continues to expand and we continue to expand the number of the direct-to-patient pharmacies, probably in and around 30 at this point. So -- and the product lines that we\u2019re carrying is now bigger on those pharmacies. So it's not unusual for us to carry double-digit number of products in those pharmacies; all good news because it expands our touch points to the patient, reinforces our relationships with our biopharmaceutical partners. So we\u2019re encourage by the continued growth in China and we see it as a really exciting market. John Kreger : And then maybe a quick follow up. Can you remind us how the Henry Schein alliance will flow through the P&L? Did that have an impact on the quarter to support it or will it mostly\u2026. George Barrett : So essentially what's going to happen is the sales that used to be reported through a part of our Medical business which was in ambulatory, those sales will ship to Schein? We will see our value coming through the gross margin line and our products flow through their channel. So that's the basic mechanics. And you would not have seen any value in the quarter completed. Mike Kaufmann : And obviously our sales reps obviously moved over to Henry Schein. So revenue expenses moved over to Henry Schein and obviously the margin will generate that but that's going to be more than offset. As we said this will be accretive. So it's by the margin that we will make on our sale of products to Henry Schein. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. Dave Francis : Down on a couple of questions asked earlier. George and Mike, can you talk a little bit more about the drivers that you're seeing from your chair on what's creating the current pricing activity on the generic front? Is it push back from insurers or the retail folks in the chain or other folks in the supply chain that are kind of equalizing the supply demand dynamic, or is there something -- other factor at play that's causing a moderation in pricing on the generic front. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I'm not sure that it's a single factor, and again Dave, it's hard to say, to describe a trend. I think we've talked at times about the conditions that we saw that probably led to some of the increased prices. I would say systemically we're not seeing a big change in that. So it's really individual behaviors. These are all individual products. You have to remember that when we talk about the pricing movement, the biggest swings that have occurred over the last couple of years are on hundreds, not thousands of products. And so I'm really discrete to the individual supplier and their product line, and so I wouldn\u2019t say the overall conditions of the market have necessarily changed. We're just -- based on just some data we have and we saw in the first half, we just decided that in our model we would moderate that second half. But as I said before, it is extremely difficult to project this, because it really is individual companies with individual product lines. Dave Francis : As a follow up, going to the capital deployment side of things, you guys have quite a few different strategic development efforts going on across both product lines and geographies. Is it possible to try and tease out from you a little bit more about where you see more specifically in the different areas that you're looking at better options than others relative to putting capital to work on the acquisition front. George Barrett : It's a good question. I wish I could answer it fully for you, which of course I can't, in terms of what we look at. But let me just highlight the priority areas. Certainly where we can build scale in our pharmaceutical business and particularly around generics, it's always effective. Those opportunities don\u2019t come up every day. But those are my high priority. Specialty continues to be an area of high emphasis. We believe that you'll continue to see the growth of specialty biopharmaceuticals and products that address unique patient populations. And so we continue to look in that area. Everything around the IDN hospital services for us is important. Many hospitals are beginning to look, particularly given some of the changes in reimbursement and even some of the news coming out of HHS this week, looking at bundled payment models. Some of the area that used to be revenue drivers in a different model could become constant, and so the opportunity to provide those services might be areas we look. Consumables -- the ability to grow our consumable and our physician preference items, clear priorities for us. The home -- activities around the home and China, those are all areas that we've talked about as high priority. You guys know the system there. Some of those areas that have many, many more activities and more players and there are others that have fewer, maybe more highly consolidated, et cetera. So those are sort of priority areas. We're looking at all of them, pretty much all of the time and the opportunities will come when they come. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette : So for the medical segment, I guess as we move further into calendar '15. Are there any signs at all or any buzz still within the industry about accelerated patient volume growth for your hospital customer base related specifically to health reforms. There still seems to be some mixed views on this within the investment community for the hospital sector in particular. Mike Kaufmann : I think mixed use is probably right. There are some clear signs, and CMS at this point I think is saying enrollment is close to 10 million at this point coming through the ACA. It's very difficult to tease out exactly what the contribution is in a hospital setting. In think we certainly -- as we look at our pharmaceutical business and we look at prescription centers, there's certainly some indication and it's more intuitive than anything else that there are more patients in the system. And I think it's reasonable to assume that more patients covered have some impact on the hospital side. But it's much harder to tease out, partly because we're seeing some shift in channel behavior. So it's not like you have one system. When you have moving for example from an acute care setting to an ambulatory setting, you can see a shift in volume. So it's much more difficult to tease out the exact total volume impact of the Affordable Care Act and how that floats through the acute care centers, because we're seeing sort of a natural shift in delivery of care where it's being delivered. We\u2019re also seeing a little bit of shift of market-share among players, given some of the network design issues in the system. So it's a little bit difficult to tease that for you. Steven Valiquette : And you actually hear your customers talking about there or is it just sort of a quiet on that front right now? George Barrett : No, you actually hear views from different customers. So there are some that are [indiscernible] that they're seeing increases and some that are not experiencing quite as much. So as you describe mix signals, it's probably a little bit of an accurate description. Operator : Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian : So I'm trying to get a better idea of how conservative your guidance is putting Nexium aside. So as I think about it, Pharma sales were very strong of a -- maybe incrementally lower margin from Hep C. The Red Oak contribution is ahead of schedule. There is now slight commodity tailwind. But guidance has to be raised roughly by the amount of the beat [ph] from litigation. So is the offset from Canada incentive comp that might not have been fully baked in before? Is that the right way to think about it or is there anything else to consider? Mike Kaufmann : Well, one thing that I consider remember is the tax rate is an important driver. I'm not sure how the litigation piece would affect. It's really -- and that was in GAAP, not in our non-GAAP numbers. And so I'm not sure how that would effect, but tax rate is one thing to consider. Remember last year we also had a minority investment income in Q3 that we had talked about. That\u2019s not expected to repeat in the second half which was a large number. We did expect the Canadian pressures to continue to happen throughout the rest of the half, and while we\u2019ve said Red Oak started a little sooner, that doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that it's going to get a lot bigger into Q3 and Q4. It just came a little bit sooner. George Barrett : Again, I'm going to just jump in here for second. Again I wouldn\u2019t comment on how conservative or not conservative our guidance is. I'd say that we\u2019re performing very well right now in general, and so we feel very good about the first-half and actually pretty excited about the second half of the year. So our guidance was increased. We feel good about that and again, we'll leave it to others to judge whether or not it was conservative or aggressive. But we like our positioning and we\u2019re pushing ahead. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Eric Coldwell : Can you hear me? A quick one here off topic related to foreign currency. I didn\u2019t hear a lot about that today. I'm curious about the impact overall of course specifically in Canada, with the Canadian dollar we gained about 17% in the last six months. Two is on the impact to the medical surgical segment and if you can talk through some of the dynamics on revenue and profit dollars related to that? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information here. First of all, we did realize a smaller benefit from FX in Q2 than we did in Q1, but again it was minor. Our assumption for the remainder of the fiscal year is really some modest upside to -- with FX and that\u2019s already built into our guidance. The thing you have to remember on FX that makes it unique is because we operate in some countries but we buy in others, you have the impact that one could be a positive, the other one could be a negative. And so the net, if you really want size, it's very small at this point in time. Sally Curley : Eric or the operator, do you have a follow-up? Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George Barrett : With that, thank you all for you questions and I very much appreciate all of you joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to speaking with all of you later. Thanks. Operator : And again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

We hope to see many of you in an upcoming event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett: Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us on our third quarter call. I'm pleased to report another strong period of results, with third quarter revenues of $25.4 billion, an increase of 18%. Third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.19, up 18% from last year. Based on the strength of our performance year-to-date, we are increasingly confident that we will finish our fiscal 2015 in the upper half of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.28 to $4.38. This is an extraordinary time in health care, and our organization is doing an outstanding job of serving today's needs, while at the same time, leveraging on our experience to address the demands of a system in transition. Our people have done this through a disciplined focus on execution by using our capabilities and insights to anticipate change and commit to providing solutions for emerging health care challenges. With this as backdrop, since we last reported earnings, we've made some important moves in areas of strategic focus. On March 2, we announced our plan to acquire the Cordis cardiology business from Johnson & Johnson. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the specialty distribution business of Metro Medical, expanding our presence and reach in specialty business. I'll come back to each of these important initiatives in my segment remarks. First, our Pharmaceutical segment. Our Pharmaceutical segment had a very strong third quarter with revenues of $22.6 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year third quarter. And our Pharmaceutical segment profit was up 25%. The Pharmaceutical segment continues to operate with great efficiency, attention to detail and strong strategic position. Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health, continues to operate extremely well. We can now report that suppliers representing nearly 100% of the total generic spend have transitioned into the venture. At time of great change, it is not just the scale which brings value to our customers, but also the combined knowledge of our 2 experienced organizations. Our Specialty Solutions business continues to achieve extremely high growth rates. And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of the specialty distribution business of Metro Medical, the largest privately owned specialty distributor in the U.S. This move strengthened our presence in the therapeutic areas of rheumatology, nephrology and oncology, expands our scale and positions us to provide more cost-effective services for our customers. For clarity, we expect to exceed the $5 billion specialty revenue figure for fiscal 2015, which we highlighted in our last earnings call, even without the contribution of the Metro Medical specialty business. As you know, over the last few months, we've seen some important developments in the world of biosimilars, and we've said to you before, it's very difficult to make categorical predictions on the evolution of this new subset of products. We continue to believe that each product will have its own characteristics, driven by many factors, including: regulatory interchangeability; the disease which the drug addresses; the need for patient support; the location and mode of delivery; and of course, the competitive response. We feel well positioned to participate in each of these opportunities as they emerge, and the acquisition of Metro Medical expands our reach. Turning to our Medical segment. We reported revenues for the quarter of $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. Our segment profit was down 8% in an operating environment largely similar to that which we've outlined in prior quarters. I'd like to take a few minutes to address this and give some perspective on the Medical segment's performance, positioning and role in Cardinal Health's growth plans. This is the commentary I would more typically provided at year end. As our Medical numbers in the last few quarters have lagged below our high standards, I wanted to address it directly now. We take great pride in being best-in-class in the distribution of traditional branded medical surgical products. The market forces have put pressure on prices in this legacy line of business. This is not new. In over recent years, we have been purposely building a range of new products and services that are strategically aligned with health care trends, are highly valuable to our customers, expand margins and build on our base in traditional distribution. Why has this been a more difficult year for our Medical segment? Simply put, price erosion in that legacy branded med-surg distribution business, combined with the challenges in the Canadian market, have been more pronounced in this past year. And while we have seen uplift from the newer services and products, the uplift has not been large enough to offset those factors. How have we been responding to this? We are relentlessly driving cost efficiency, while at the same time continuing to reposition our Medical segment portfolio to ensure we are bringing to market the products and services that meet the future needs of our customers in a rapidly changing environment. And I'd like to highlight a few of these moves. We've expanded our consumable product line to position us to drive more Cardinal Health medical products and through more channels. Our move to acquire Cordis significantly enhances our scale, product line and capabilities in cardiology, building on our acquisition of AccessClosure and aligning with our overall strategy around physician preference items. Together, they complement our moves in orthopedics and wound management to bring standardization and efficiency to medical devices, a major pain point for our IDN customers and a meaningful driver of profit growth in the coming years. More about Cordis in a few minutes. Cardinal Health at Home, formerly AssuraMed, continues to grow significantly in excess of market growth. We have unique capabilities in the fulfillment and the complex administration of serving patients in the home. Our colleagues at Cardinal Health at Home interact with these patients every day. They are extremely well trained and totally committed to supporting the needs of these patients. We did complete one small home health tuck-in acquisition during the quarter. We continue to see great potential as more care is delivered in the home. Our strategic partnership with Henry Schein is off to a good start. While still new, we are now able to bring the Schein physician practice capability to our IDN customers. We're beginning to ship products to Schein facilities and plans are to have the integration substantially completed during the June quarter. I had the opportunity in recent weeks to address the combined teams at the Schein's National Sales Meeting, and it was clear that the group is extremely optimistic about the opportunities in front of them. To be clear, these strategic initiatives are not a departure from our traditional distribution. Rather, they draw upon our expertise, our considerable channel strength and the Cardinal Health name, to bring the additional products and services that our customers and patients need to thrive in this dynamic health care environment. That leads to [ph] me going forward in our Medical segment. We don't expect major changes in the environment over the next few quarters, and we could see a bit of choppiness. But as we look forward and into the back half of FY '16, we would expect to see the new and growing business lines in the Medical segment and the increased utilization giving us a more sustainable uplift. Going back to Cordis, which we announced on March 2, we are making excellent progress in our work to move towards closing. Leadership teams and organizational design have been defined in all key markets. And recently, we received early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, the first of a series of steps to close. Finally, trying to continue this track record of double-digit growth, we continue to see great opportunities in this expansive market. It is very clear that the growth of the health care market in China will continue to outpace general economic growth, driven by demographics, lifestyle changes and strong government prioritization. Overall, Cardinal Health is performing at a high level, generating strong cash flow and showing consistent growth. The repositioning of our portfolio over the last half decade has been driven by a clear perspective on how we see health care evolving. Most of our customers across multiple channels are experiencing new dynamics, as both public- and private-sector forces push them to deliver care more cost-effectively, in a more coordinated fashion, into emerging sites of care, in such a way as to bring the patient more squarely into the equation. Our ability to offer a broad and integrated set of solutions across the continuum of care and to continue to innovate around our customer base has enabled new opportunities for growth, at the same time, helped us to absorb the bumps that can occur in a system going through rapid change. I think it's an indicator of the overall strength of our portfolio that even through this transition, we expect to deliver non-GAAP operating earnings growth for this full fiscal year in the mid-teens. There's no other health care company that has quite the range of tools we can bring to the market and do so at a time when comprehensive solutions are the need of the day. Put another way, we can address a larger percentage of virtually any customer's overall business than any other company in health care. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann: Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to hear about our strong third quarter results. My comments will walk through our third quarter consolidated financial performance as well as expectations for the quarter ahead as we close out our 2015 fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew 18% to $1.19. Total company revenues were $25.4 billion, which was also an increase of more than 18%. Total company gross margin dollars were up more than 12% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, with the largest driver being acquisitions. Next, non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $656.7 million, which is a 17% growth versus the prior year. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in at $32.7 million in the quarter. As a reminder, Q3 of the prior fiscal year included a $0.06 per share after-tax gain related to the sale of our minority equity interest in 2 investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.5%, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were about 334 million. Moving to operating cash flows. We generated $658 million in the quarter. At March close, our cash balance was $3.2 billion, with $447 million of this held offshore. We remain committed to our previously stated balanced capital deployment policy of focusing on reinvesting in our business and maintaining our differentiated dividend, while pursuing strategic M&A and stock buybacks on an opportunistic basis. Next, I'll review each segment's performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues were up 20% year-over-year to $22.6 billion due to the growth of existing and new customers across all business lines in the segment. Segment profit was $567 million, an increase of 25% versus the prior year. This was due to the strong performance of our generics program, including the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing as well as growth from our existing customers and contribution from new customers. Segment profit margin rate increased by 10 basis points, driven by the performance of our generics program, which offset the impact of customer price changes and the dilutive impact of sales of branded hepatitis C therapies. Clearly, the performance of our generics program has been excellent. Enhanced sourcing under Red Oak customer wins and growth of existing accounts have all been key drivers. Manufacturer price inflation or deflation, new item launches, penetration of existing accounts and advanced pricing analytics are also factors in determining our program's success. I remain confident we can balance all of these for continued growth in our generics program. Besides the contribution from generics, our branded drug business continues to go well with strong performance under our fee-for-service agreements. As has been typical over the past several years, inflation tends to be a larger component in the third quarter versus other quarters. The rate of inflation was essentially the same as the prior year, in the low double digits. As George mentioned, in our Specialty business, we closed the acquisition of Metro Medical earlier this month. Let me give you a few details. Metro Medical has various business lines. We acquired their specialty distribution, specialty GPO, specialty pharmacy and private label medical surgical disposable products business. The Metro Medical Online and Metro Medical Partners pieces of the business were not included in the acquisition. This acquisition will provide us the opportunity to expand our Specialty distribution scale and deepen our reach into the rheumatology, nephrology and oncology markets. We have been working on this deal for several months and had already contemplated the bottom line impact in our FY '15 EPS guidance range. Now let's move to our Medical segment performance. Third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions. The segment profit declined by $9.1 million to $101.5 million. This was a result of the decline in the contribution of national brand med-surg distribution and the continued impact of the previously communicated challenges in the business in Canada. These same drivers contributed to a margin rate decline of 50 basis points versus the prior year period. Let me give you a few other highlights to consider. First, revenues from our strategic accounts continues to significantly outpace our remaining book of business. In addition, top line growth from our higher-margin wraparound services is outpacing overall Medical segment revenues. Our Cardinal Health at Home business has grown at or above market each quarter of this fiscal year. And finally, we are continuing to build out the physician preference items strategy. In this space, our acquisitions of AccessClosure and Innovative Therapies are off to a good start and are performing better than the business case. Our recent announcement of our intend to acquire Cordis, which we still expect to close before the end of the calendar year, will only accelerate our work in this space. Let me reiterate some key points surrounding this deal. First, we will be acquiring Cordis for $1.944 billion in cash or approximately $1.6 billion, net of roughly $350 million in cash tax benefits. Next, we plan to finance the acquisition with debt and cash on hand. Our intent is to issue debt sometime in the next few months and take out the $1 billion bridge financing that we secured as a contingency. From a non-GAAP EPS perspective, we expect slight dilution in FY '16 as a result of the 3 factors that we mentioned at the time of the announcement : first, FY '16 will only include a partial year of Cordis earnings; second, we expect approximately a full year of interest expense estimated at $0.07 to $0.08; and third, there will be $0.13 to $0.15 of unfavorable impact due to an inventory fair value step up. Then in fiscal 2017, the first full year post close, we expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We still expect operational synergies of at least $100 million annually by the time we exit fiscal 2018. Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, I'd like to add a few updates on China, which reports into both segments. Our businesses in China continued to perform well. We continued to see strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 25%. Also, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition of a local distributor in northeastern China, which expands our local direct distribution to 11 cities. Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost, which reduced our GAAP results by $0.15 per share. Looking forward, we are increasingly confident in the upper half of our non-GAAP EPS range of $4.28 to $4.38. Let me finish with the following updates around our corporate assumptions. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate range to be between 36% to 37%. This obviously implies that our fourth quarter rate will be higher, likely between 38% and 41%, based on the timing and outcome of various discussions we are having with tax authorities. We are expecting capital expenditures to come in at about $330 million and our full year amortization expectations increase to about $190 million based on the acquisitions we have completed as of March 31. We don't expect the Metro Medical acquisition to add a significant amount to our final number for the year. In closing, we're pleased with our overall performance in the third quarter, recognizing that we've got some important work to do in Medical to shift the trajectory. We've taken great steps during the past several years to build a strong foundation for sustainable future growth. That's why, across the enterprise, I expect a solid finish to our fiscal year. With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. As we think about the performance in Medical, George, it seems like volumes have been improving on the inpatient side. You've added some accretive margin deals. It sounds like private label is still growing, yet the business has struggled. And I know you mentioned Canada being an issue for the balance of the year. So I'm just curious if you can maybe give us some insight on when you think this business could really start to turn around. George S. Barrett: Bob, thanks for the question. Yes, look, Canada has definitely been a tough challenge all year, and as you said, we tried to be pretty clear about the work that we need to do and are doing in the Med segment. I think we just have to get through some sort of short-term choppiness. I mentioned during the call that sort of the traditional -- the legacy lines of sort of traditional branded med-surg has been a large of the challenge, and it's really been largely re-pricing of some accounts. I think we'll start to see the benefit of all the initiatives that we've described begin to more sustainably feel like uplift as we get into the second half of '16. But I actually like our position. I think we're doing really good work. If you look underneath the numbers, over the last 3 years, for example, we've had very good growth of our private label products, a good contribution of margin from them. So it's really about this shift in the model where the legacy line is becoming a smaller component of the overall mix and those newer products and services are beginning to grow. So we've done some really important work there. We've made some big moves this year to sort of strengthen that, and feel good about that. Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : If I could just sneak one in on Specialty, I know in the quarter you acquired Metro Medical, just curious maybe if you'd give a little bit more on how that business specifically enhances your Specialty footprint. And then I know broadly, George, you've gotten this question in the past, but increasingly seems like Specialty is obviously in a very important channel for the wholesalers. And I'm just curious, how do you feel about your footprint even in light of the Metro Medical deal? And are there bigger deals out there that could really give you greater exposure to this important channel? George S. Barrett: Yes. Bob, let me answer that, and I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the first part of the question again. But Metro Medical really just helps us expand our reach. We've been growing at a pretty hefty clip over these last couple of years. And I think our scale is now at a point where we really are a meaningful factor in the market. I think that's important, given some of the trends in health care, and Metro Medical just expands that reach in that footprint. So we're excited about it. Whether or not there are other opportunities out there, we continue to look at every opportunity that's in our areas of strategic focus. Obviously, Specialty is one. Whether or not you find the assets at the right moment at the right price is always a question for us. But this is clearly an area of priority, and so we'll continue to look for opportunities. But we're excited about the Metro Medical. Again, just sort of backing up. I wanted to make sure I highlight this on the Medical, just as a reminder. Our customers are really becoming much more complex. They're no longer a single line of activity. And so I do think that's part of what we've felt strongly about is that these complex systems need products and services across all of the lines of business. So that's really important at a time where you're seeing the change in incentives, which has been completely activity-based over the year, just a different kind of incentive system. I think the tools we really bring are going to become increasingly important. So just I didn't want to miss the opportunity to say that related to the first part of the question. Operator : We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : A question on M&A. Post Cordis, what is your appetite for M&A? Obviously, you did Metro Medical, which is on the smaller size. But what leverage are you comfortable going up to? And when you think about the areas you're interested, obviously Specialty is one, but maybe if can kind of rank order them for us? George S. Barrett: Yes. So first -- again, appetite is a -- we want to grow this business. We want sustainable competitive positioning, and we believe that there are key areas strategically that are aligned with where care is going. And we've been pretty clear about that. It's around generics. It's around specialty. It's around every opportunity to improve performance management for large integrated customers. It's the home, opportunities in China, which is a unique market. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. Obviously, we have a strong balance sheet. But again, we're going to be very disciplined about the moves we make, when we make them, how we make them, to make sure that we can execute, and that's always been a priority for us. But we feel well positioned, strong balance sheet. I don't know if Mike you want to add anything to that. Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes. Ricky, I think -- again, it's going to depend and whether it's a strategic fit, whether the culture fits for us, the growth trajectory, all of those types of things of the acquisitions. But from a balance sheet standpoint, we have said that we would like to keep our debt ratio to 1.5 to 1.75 is the range that we're comfortable in. Could we at times make a decision to go slightly above that for the right type of acquisition and stretch ourselves some? Sure, we would be open to doing that. We're always going to want to be concerned about where our -- where the debt rating agencies see us, and that's an important thing for us to consider and how they view it. And so sometimes, the type of acquisition matters when we deal with those folks. And so -- and remember, it's the last thing, too, we like to keep about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash on hand just for our everyday working capital and needs because of the fluctuations in the business. So those are some of the things that we try to keep in mind. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the strong branded inflation. I think it was in the low double digits. And we're hearing strong inflation on generics. Where do you think we are in the pricing cycle and kind of like the sustainability of the trend, kind of like across your portfolio? Because we're seeing it both on brand, generic and specialty. George S. Barrett: Ricky, I'll start with it, but then I'll welcome Mike to join in. Predicting this going forward is always difficult. The branded side, as you've seen, has been, on average, which is interesting, relatively consistent for a while. But actually, inside that average, there's a lot of different rates. And so it's one of the things that makes it in a way hard to predict, but in some ways little easier because you have this smoothing affect. On generics, it is such a tough call because, as you know, it is an enormous product line that we call generics. And so the number of products that can move the needle can be relatively small, and you can talk about 50, 75, 100 products that move the needle. So it's really difficult for us to give a forward-looking guidance on what we see. We've done this in the past, and I probably do it today -- we talked about the environment and what are the conditions of the environment. And I'm not sure that those conditions have changed materially from last period, but we have seen some variance -- variation. Mike can touch on that. Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes, I would agree with George. On the branded space, it's been pretty consistent over the last several years that branded inflation rate has stayed in that double digits -- low double-digits area, and we've not seen a lot of fluctuation there. I just wanted to really call it out, this quarter remind folks of the seasonality component and why the third quarter tends to be bigger than some of the other quarters. And again, we all know the majority of the fees are earned on the fee-for-service agreement, so inflation is a much -- on brand, is a much lower component of our margins than it used to be in the buy-and-hold period. But again, in the third quarter, it's important, so that's really why we call it out. On generics, it is important, but one of the things that we keep trying to emphasize is that in our mind, it probably gets a little bit too much attention at times because there are a lot of other levers in our generics program that are going to help us perform over the years. And we really believe confidently that even in a -- if generic inflation were to decline, there's a lot of other levers for us around our penetration, around our pricing and analytics capabilities, around new business that we won, et cetera, that we can still compete effectively and perform well. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So med-surg, 2 questions. One would be your comment in the press release on national brand distribution. Is that meant to reflect your commentary on pricing erosion, or is there anything else meant by that? And then also relative to Canada, have we now reached a point where next quarter will anniversary some of those initial issues and customer departures or movement in-house? Does that help in the second half? George S. Barrett: Yes. So really, Eric, what we're talking about primarily is really pricing on the traditional med-surg. It's probably not much more complicated than that. And a lot of that is actually repricing some meaningful accounts for us, which we were happy to have in the long run, important customers, strategic customers. I'm sorry, the second part of your question? Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Within Canada, it feels like it's been about a year since we first saw some of those issues. I know there were a couple of customers that moved in-house. Will we now anniversary that? George S. Barrett: Yes, so here's what I would say, and I mentioned this earlier. I would say probably a couple of choppy quarters. And then I think we're taking some pretty significant actions in Canada to address some changes in that market, and I think then we'll start to feel a more normalized rate. Michael C. Kaufmann: Eric, I would expect us to still see some pressures in Canada through the end of the calendar year. So it will still affect us for the first 2 quarters of FY '16. And then beginning in our Q3 of '16, we begin to see a more normal and leveling off in the Canadian business. Operator : We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Can you guys talk a bit about biosimilars and what's sort of opportunity you're looking at? And maybe just touch on the different channels that biosimilars will flow through. If they ship to the member at home where they self-inject or if they ship to the doc office, are you better positioned in any one of those channels than the other? George S. Barrett: Yes. Again, I'm not sure I can add that much to what I said in my earlier comments, but again, I'll just sort of highlight this. And we've -- I think, many of you have asked this over the years, something we've been anticipating in terms of biosimilars -- that we've always felt that there would be some uniqueness to each product. And as you said, the route of administration, which channel it goes through, whether or not there's substitutability, these are all things that will influence what kind of services the patient needs. We actually feel well positioned, regardless of route, is what I would tell you. So as you know, we've got a extremely strong position in hospitals. We've expanded our position in all kinds of clinics. We're very strong in pharmacy. We have got specialty pharmacy. So clinics are an area. And now, obviously, we've got some enhanced strength in the small physician practices. So I think, from our standpoint, we've got great reach across therapeutic areas, which is very important. And from a channel perspective, I think we're in a pretty good position, regardless of that route. Michael C. Kaufmann: The only thing I would add to that, George, is that also from a services standpoint upstream to the manufacturer, we feel that we're in as good or better position than anybody in the industry to provide any type of services that they might need, whether it'd be specific cold chain or other type of transportation needs. Whether it'd be hub services, data and analytics, we know that we can provide all of the services too. So we really feel that we're in a great position, both upstream and downstream, on biosimilars. Operator : We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : George and Mike, if you're willing, thinking about some of the puts and takes for next fiscal year, how do you feel about the outlook realizing it's early compared to some of your longer-term growth goals? George S. Barrett: So again, John, it's a little early for us to be saying a lot about '16. We're finishing our budget process. Obviously, at year end we provide guidance. But in terms of our long-term goals, we still feel good about those. The organization right now has -- it feels like a lot of momentum, actually. And I think, if you go around Cardinal Health, I think you'd see a group that's very energized. We're very clear about our goals, very disciplined in managing to those. And we'll have a little bit of bumps in any part of the business, but the overall Cardinal enterprise feels good and on target to achieve the goals that we've set up. Michael C. Kaufmann: No, I would agree. We do need to get through the budgeting process this summer. That's really important. Probably the only thing that we've really mentioned about next year that I can give you a quick update on was around the commodities. And we did say that, for FY '16, that they would be about $10 million to $20 million of benefit from commodities. We have updated that work, and we can still continue to believe that that's the right number for next year. I know that's only one small component that goes into it, but it is the only thing that we've really giving you any insight on. George S. Barrett: I guess and the Cordis -- and the Cordis mechanics. Michael C. Kaufmann: And then the Cordis mechanics that I've walked through, yes. John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up on Red Oak. As you move into year 2, it sounds like you've pretty much finished your work with supplier recontracting. What happens next? Is there an opportunity for meaningful growth in year 2 as well? Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes, I'm really excited about where we are in Red Oak. We -- I serve on the board of Red Oak and recently had a board meeting and continue to be incredibly impressed with the team. We've, again, been able to retain all of the key folks from both companies and have decades of generic buying experience on there, which -- again, to get through essentially 100% of the spend in this short a period of time has been exciting. We do expect there to be uplift in FY '16. A big piece of that will just because we'll have a full year of all of the benefits while we were ramping this year. But even on top of that, we do expect to continue to generate value. And as I met with the team, they're constantly looking at different ways to work with the manufacturers to try to create more incremental value for both parties. Operator : We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And George, I just want to kind of come back and revisit this Medical segment issue a little bit further. You talked, obviously, a lot on the call about the pricing pressure within the segment. Is that repricing certain GPO customers that you got hit with? And is there anything else on the horizon that would impact the pricing as we go forward over the next 12 months? And I'm also kind of curious, could you talk about the overall pricing of the underlying inventory you're selling? Are you seeing price deflation on the products you're selling, or is that still somewhat inflationary? Is that impacting the profit margins at all either? George S. Barrett: I am going to come back to the second part. And I'm not completely sure I understand the question, but we'll make sure we do and then Mike will address that. But this is really not a GPO issue, Glen, and so this is just individual accounts that happen to fall during a period of time where we're signing some long-term agreements. No single one of them, by the way, is big enough to call out or necessarily move the needle. It's just a general dynamic. What again I wanted to highlight during the call is that, over many years, the traditional, what we call, branded med-surg business is going through this kind of dynamic, and so that's really not new. So I don't want to make it sound like there is one big contract that was the key, which is some repricing in that aspect of the business we felt. And I hope that answers that part of it. The second part of the question, Mike, did you get? Michael C. Kaufmann: Let me take a stab at it, and if I don't get it right, Glen, please just ask again. But I agree with George as far as the GPOs. We always work with them, but in tandem, we work individually with the hospitals. And if you take a look at the product portfolios, I don't think this is really necessarily a deflationary environment on all the items. You're going to see certain items that may go up and some they're going to go down, but I wouldn't say there's any one trend either way that is actually affecting this. This is just our ultimate net price to the customer themselves, not the items driving it. Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up. I mean, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on what the challenge is in the Canadian market? Because it kind of sounds like it's going to persist for another 2 to 3 quarters, and I think it'd be helpful if you'd kind of just remind us exactly what that issue is. Michael C. Kaufmann: Really 2 things. One is similar to what we just described, some repricing of customers. And as we mentioned last time, there were a couple of customers that we did lose in Canada that we won't actually anniversary until the end of the calendar year. One of those brought in-house, the services they were doing, and one switched to a competitor. So that's really what's driving it is a loss of a couple of larger customers as well as some pricing and retention of some other customers, and those are really 2 big factors. George S. Barrett: The other piece that I'd mention is, there's been some shifting of reimbursement dynamics around that market, and so again, that is a component of that pricing aspect. Michael C. Kaufmann: And remember, those customer losses are not new ones. Those are the ones I mentioned last quarter that are out there. It just was going to take to the end of the calendar year for us to anniversary them. Operator : We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division : So I wanted to just touch base regarding Cordis. So obviously, you haven't closed the deal yet, but you do have very close relationships with some of your physician and hospital partners. You've got some key thought leaders in the field that you interact with on a regular basis. What's the dialogue been post the announcement now that, that's seasoned a bit with those individuals? And what other sort of things has it sparked in your mind as you think about kind of the long-term strategic value of the endeavor? George S. Barrett: Yes. So this is -- it's been actually a really interesting period since the announcement. A couple of things happened, many of which we thought could happen, which is just a high amount of energy around this inside our organization. I think, the people that are going to be joining us from J&J are pretty excited about where this falls for us in terms of priority. We're getting great feedback from our advisory boards. As I think we've mentioned before, we've got really world-class advisory boards who are working with us. We've started to, as you might imagine hear from other players in the market, who recognize that we might be an interesting partner for them as we expand our commercial capabilities, both here and outside the U.S., in these medical products. So I think what we're seeing is a pretty high level of enthusiasm across the board. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to get to the finish line and the closing. But it's been really well received. And I think that one of the things that I would highlight is, people are now beginning to realize that it's not just about the product. And so that we are talking about a different service offering in terms of being able to bring the medical device and some wraparound services that help manage inventory, eliminate waste, prevent errors, these are all part of the strategy in helping in the physician preference area. So I think what's happening both internally and externally is that our excitement about joining those 2 components, the service component and the product component, are giving us a pretty good sense of optimism about the future on this. Operator : We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I'm just wondering, can you give us maybe some color, George, around the size of Metro Medical? Obviously, you talked about it being in 2015 numbers, but maybe on a revenue basis, how big is this? George S. Barrett: Lisa, unfortunately, I can't provide that information right now. I think what we -- as we come out of our year and we start guiding into next year, I think some of that will become a little bit more apparent. But at this point, I can't provide more information. I'm sorry. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then secondly, as we think about Red Oak and we think about relationships with manufacturers, there is a lot of talk about continued consolidation of generic manufacturers. Can you talk at all about your expectation, you or Mike, around Red Oak and how that will impact you going forward? George S. Barrett: Yes. Well, let me just start and then Mike can speak more specifically to Red Oak. Lisa, as you know, consolidation is not really new to the industry, it's been happening for quite some time. It's something we're used to. It's a dynamic we understand. And it's one of the reasons that having scale is really important, and it's also a reason that's sort of the knowledge base [ph] of what each supplier's strategy is all about. But that actually matters, because ultimately what we're looking for in the best of situations is those win-win moments. So I think we understand the landscape well and we know the players well. And so consolidation -- so it can be a double-edged sword, but I think for us, we see the opportunity to work more closely with companies. We see that as an opportunity. Mike, I don't know if you want to sort of add to it more narrowly from the Red Oak perspective. Michael C. Kaufmann: Probably the only thing I would add is that, first, I guess I would emphasize I really like where our relationships are with the manufacturers. They value us. They understand the simplicity and the speed of our model, and particularly, the transparency. And the feedback we're getting from manufacturers around those components has been incredibly positive. And what that leads to is us being willing to try new things with them. And we are also very focused on not only the large manufacturers but also smaller and medium-size ones that have really mentioned that they appreciate that they've been able to be part of the program. And so, again, consolidation is part of the industry. But we like where we're at. And we think, in certain situations, if we needed to, we can work with folks to try to create the right competitive environment to get the type of pricing we need. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So I guess just within the Medical segment, I'm curious in relation to the Cordis acquisition. Is your plate going to be pretty full over the next year just on the integration of this fairly large asset? Or if, let's say, other medical manufacturing assets are potentially available for acquisition, would you have the bandwidth to do additional medical manufacturing M&A deals in this segment over the next years? George S. Barrett: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So obviously, I'm going to answer this with some care. Let me just start with the basics. As I mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is strong. Our organizational capacity is very significant. But we always put a high priority on execution. And so we think about, when we look at acquisitions, not just the financial capacity to execute and integrate, but the organizational capacity to do that. So we're very mindful of that. I would also note that we have a very broad-based employee population. So for example, we can have a group of folks that are very deeply dedicated to the integration of one asset and literally another group whose lives are untouched by that. And so what we are mindful of as we look across opportunities externally is making sure that we're not doubling down on those people who are trying to do a one-to-one execution, execution of one deal. But always mindful of that, but I think we have a pretty talented diverse organization with a lot of capacity. But we'll always think about execution. Operator : We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I just had a question about the independent pharmacy channel. Are you seeing any more signs of stress in that channel just given some of the fundamentals around generic inflation and reimbursement squeeze? And if so, are you approaching that marketplace differently than, say, you were 3 or 4 years ago? George S. Barrett: John, let me start first, and then I'm going to turn it to Mike. Again, we'll probably have 2 angles on this. We've been doing really well providing value to these independent pharmacy customers. And so I think the key is recognizing that there are certain market dynamics and market pressures that they deal with, and what we do is focus on how do we relieve those pressures, how do we create value in that environment? So I think what's happened is we've become increasingly targeted on how we create value for those kinds of customers in this kind of environment. And our organization has done a really good job in terms of expanding our position there and growing some share, and I feel good about our position with how we're creating value. But certainly, there are pressures out there that they have to deal with. I think we're doing a lot to help them. Michael C. Kaufmann: I mean, I can think of a couple of specific examples. First of all, obviously, Red Oak and our ability to be competitive from a generic programs and recognizing the need and how we price generics at different lifecycles of reimbursement, that's always important to do that. Our PSAO has been growing steadily, and we've added a lot of members. And we've been able to do some unique things with them and get out and market our PSAO and work with our customers to help them on their star ratings to make sure that they are the type of customers that the PBMs want to do business with, and we are incredibly excited about those. And then in other areas in the out front part of the store, we've been expanding our programs and opportunities there to work with the folks. And we really like where we're headed with some of our Cardinal private label lines and our opportunities to help them manage inventory, both on the out front and behind the counter. So we have a lot that we're doing. I wouldn't say that we're seeing any decline that we've seen in this. We continue to grow our share in that space. And that's how I feel. One thing, though, if you didn't know what I meant, and for those on the phone, about the PSAO, that's our third-party contracting arm where we work with third-party payers to -- on behalf of our retail independents to get them reimbursements. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And my other question, just checking in on your other channel. You sell under a lot of IDNs. What are they asking for from you that they were not asking for 2 years ago? And is there any effect yet that you're seeing from the ACA in terms of what capabilities you need? George S. Barrett: Yes. It's a really interesting question because I think what they're seeing is a -- I think, many of the big acute care and integrated systems are recognizing that in a world where there's probably some shifting in incentives, where you're looking at bundles of care in payments, where there are penalties for readmission, they're just beginning to look at each line more holistically. I think that one of the changes that we have seen, certainly you still have to be very, very competitive in each line, is that the institution at the enterprise level of the IDN is thinking holistically about how do we compete, how do we thrive in this new environment? And I think that's why our work across the enterprise is particularly resonating right now, because we're really not just able to -- we're not just talking about lines of business. We are talking about being able to address a huge percentage of their activity, and I think we're sort of the only one that can do this in quite that way. Operator : We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just had a couple of questions on the quarter. So first, on the Pharma segment. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the revenue growth of 20%? You called out growth from both new and existing customers, so maybe if you could break those 2 out or give us an idea. And any other relevant metrics, such as volume growth or other inflation, hep C so on and so forth? Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes. So I can give you a little color. First of all, the hep C component of our growth is still less than 25% of the overall growth. I mean, it's an important driver, but it is less than 25%. New customers would be the largest component of our growth. And then growth on our existing customers would be next. Keep in mind, with branded drug inflation being in the low double digits, that's going to be a huge driver of overall top line revenue growth, particularly in a market where you haven't seen very large generic launches that would be taking away some top line volumes. So I think those would be the key drivers to help you understand that. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. Useful. And then as a follow-up, on the branded side of the business. Has the non-fee-for-service, so the buy-and-hold portion of the business, remain the same as a percent of the entire business? And within it, have the mechanics changed at all in the past few quarters, maybe a couple of years, to alter the profitability profile in any meaningful way? Michael C. Kaufmann: No, that's been really, really steady. Over an annual period, it's still averaging about 80% is noncontingent of our branded buy-side piece. And then -- but as I mentioned in the third quarter, it's a little bit more slanted towards inflation. But again, over a whole year period, it's still running 80%. The agreements continue to be about the same. Often, they renew very similar terms and conditions. We continue to tweak them, but this is an area that we continue to feel good about. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Hey, George or Mike, maybe this is more a J&J question, but can you give us any color on the Cordis kind of results, or, hopefully, post J&J controlled announcement, the wheels don't come off there? And maybe remind us of your budget plans there and what infrastructure you would want to put in place internationally to really maximize that opportunity? George S. Barrett: Unfortunately, the first part of your question really is a J&J question, and I can't answer for them. Regarding the second, we have been really hard at work on really working across the globe on what that organization is going to look like. And I think, it all feels like it's going very well in the U.S. As you know, we have some cardiology assets here, and so that we've been looking at how we're going to coordinate and integrate those activities, have a very clear game plan. x U.S., I think we've got organizational design under control. I think we've got the leadership in all key markets. Looking about key positions, we want to make sure that we retain some of the great tradition of that existing Cordis, but we want to bring some of that Cardinal approach to it. And so I think what we're -- one of the things that I mentioned earlier, Bob, that I think is interesting is, as we go outside the U.S. and we talk to the organization -- again, recognizing that certain conversations we can't have at this stage as 2 separate companies, they're particularly interested in our service model in how we can help bring additional efficiency because of the medical device side of it. So I think people are beginning to realize that we can bring more than product skill. Again, short-term critical issue for us, I talked about execution earlier, we're sort of the Hippocratic Oath, \"do no harm.\" So where the businesses are performing very well -- and there are many, many markets where there are 1 or 2 in the market, we're going to make sure that we \"do no harm\" there and keep the business executing. So I hope that helps an answer. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Maybe just a point to drill down. You're looking at the services side of things, obviously. But is there ever an R&D line item that you'll be breaking out with this and other assets that you have in place now requiring a bit more investment on that front? George S. Barrett: That's a good question. In terms of how we break it out, I can't answer it fully yet. What I can tell you in strategy, in strategy, this is not going to be a big research-based business unit inside of us. They'll be development because -- and we do that today, by the way. As a medical device company today, we're doing D of D [ph] as in development all the time. But you should not expect us to be a research-based med device company in a big way. That's not really the game plan here. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I wanted to go after the specialty piece a little different angle. Kind of looking at the fact that you guys are at a $5 billion revenue level or will be as you exit the year there, is the business now, either from a critical mass of revenue perspective or a service portfolio perspective, now at that place where you think you're big enough to grow the business organically through internal development efforts above the market rate? Or do you still need to deploy capital externally to get to the point where you are able to capture additional market share? George S. Barrett: Yes. Actually, the answer is, we are growing it organically, quite rapidly. So that's the good news. I think we have the scale. We've got great talents. It's a really innovative group. We have got a pretty good group behind that driving new models for how to create value for our specialty customers and our suppliers. So I think we're actually getting very strong organic growth and we would continue to expect to, but again, we'll look for opportunities to deploy capital if we see opportunity. But we're getting very strong organic growth. David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And then as a quick follow-up, looking back at the med-surg business. You guys have been spending a lot of time trying to get the business repurposed and a little more focused on the ambulatory side of the business as well. Can you talk about trends that you're seeing in terms of actual utilization or actual volumes being pushed outside of the inpatient environment that might be starting to pay dividends for you in terms of the investments in the home health and other ambulatory environments? George S. Barrett: Yes. So thanks, Dave. So there, the -- I would say, these trends in terms of care moving, home acute [ph] care to ambulatory settings is probably unambiguous. This is absolutely happening across the board. And getting actual exact numbers in this is difficult because I think our system is not use to tracking this. I don't mean Cardinal system, I'd say the -- those who track this kind of data. But when we talked to IDN customers and we looked at our data, it's pretty clear that more activity is being driven to different sites of care, and I think that plays to the strategy. It helps explain some of the moves that we've made, and I think it's really going to be, for us, as we go forward, a tailwind, because I think that, that is a natural byproduct of some of the changes in the incentive systems in the industry. Michael C. Kaufmann: We've seen a lot of that with our at-home business already with those change in the dynamics that it continues to grow not only significantly but above market itself. So we've [indiscernible] mix there in our ambulatory surgery center business where we continue to have very large share. That's another area that we really like. Operator : We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Obviously, a lot of discussion on Medical. I guess maybe one last question on this topic, but maybe following up on the last question here. I think part of, George, when you talked about repurposing the Medical business, you also talked about having a more extensive dialogue with the c-suite of your hospital customers. And it was something maybe that the organization wasn't really in deep with previously. Can you talk about where you are in that progress to really kind of explain what Cardinal can do for them and for IDNs in general? And so, look, maybe like where we are at that stage, in what inning, and how much further can we get -- do we need to go before we can really drive that, I guess? George S. Barrett: Yes, that's a hard question. And as you guys think about the \"what inning we are in,\" that's always a hard question because the system is going through this change. Let me highlight a couple of things. Again, as a reminder, I would say our largest customers across health care are becoming more complex, more integrated and their needs now cross more products and services than we've seen historically. So we have been, at the same time, aligning with that, and one of the things we did over the last year is to sort of create these strategic account teams. We've always had strength in our selling organization, selling lines of business. We will continue to do that, but I think a part of what we've been trying to leverage, and this is what you're touching on, is that need for the integrated system for that complex customer to think about a changing world and which are the partners who can help them. So again, as I think about changing from an industry which has been activity-based to one with different incentives to sort of a pay-for-outcome or a fee-for-outcome, I think all the tools that we bring, standardized consumables, private label and medical products, services that enable increased efficiencies, helping them navigate across their channels, our physician preference strategy, our work in the home, these are all valuable to them. And then you combine this with our pharmaceutical lines and our specialty, and I think we have sort of a unique set of offerings. We're trying to make sure that we are positioned to address that at the most senior levels of the organizations, because it's really now about competing in a world that looks in the future a little bit different than it did historically. Operator : And we'll take our last question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Mike, I just wanted to touch on something quickly. I thought I heard you say in your prepared comments, but I might have gotten the notes wrong. Did you say the customer price changes were serving as a headwind in the drug distribution business? And if you did say that, can you put a little more color around what that meant? Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes, it was one of the offsets. So we said the positives was the growth in new customers and the net benefits from Red Oak that were offsetting some of the customer price changes. And those wouldn't be anything more than the normal types of day-to-day renewals we see with all of our customers. So there's really nothing new there, no new news. It's just typical. It always tends to be one of our largest headwinds, and we're constantly working on the opposite side, obviously, to more than offset those. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Fair enough. So just the kind of the normal pricing pressure that's not part of renewals? Michael C. Kaufmann: Yes. George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And then maybe just, as we've talked about pricing pressure in the med-surg business, I guess, George or Mike, how should we think about how that pricing pressure impacts what will be the Cordis business? And is that business immune from that pricing pressure, or will that see pricing pressure as well? George S. Barrett: Well, I'm always reluctant to say anything is immune from pricing pressure, that's obviously -- would be a big statement to make. But I think we're really talking primarily about something that is a dynamic that's been occurring over some time in, what I would call, the traditional legacy med-surg business. I really would not sort of connect that necessarily -- line of business. This is just a trend that we've seen for some time. And I think what we're seeing with the other lines of business is actually they are drivers in the opposite direction. Operator : At this time, there is no further questions. I'll turn the call back to George Barrett. George S. Barrett: All right. Well, thanks, all, for your questions and for being on this call. We appreciate you doing this. We look forward to getting a chance to talk to you and seeing many of you in the near future. Thanks again. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

George? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone. And thanks to all of you for joining us for this morning's call. I know it's an incredibly busy morning for all of you, so please allow me to start by being direct. Cardinal Health had a hell of a year in fiscal 2015. Here are the facts. First, revenues climbed back over the $100 billion mark, growing 13% year-over-year. Second, we delivered the largest non-GAAP operating earnings in the 44-year history of Cardinal Health growing 15% year-over-year. Third, we generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow. And fourth, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through expanded dividends and share repurchases. And I'm proud that our organization was able to generate this financial performance while making sound and strategic moves in drug distribution, generics, specialty, small office practices, consumables, physician preference items, all putting us in a forward position to sustain meaningful and measurable growth into the future. So, again, a hell of a year. Of course, the year was not without its challenges. Year-over-year, our Medical segment was essentially flat adjusting for some non-operating compensation push downs. But we have been disciplined and determined in modernizing the portfolio of drivers in our Medical segment building off our expansive footprint, our deep customer relationships, our global manufacturing and sourcing experience and the extensive cross learnings from our work in Pharmaceuticals. To be clear, every component of this new portfolio drives growth while leveraging the strong legacy and platform of our Medical Surgical distribution. This has been a multi-year process but we expect to largely come through this transition as we exit fiscal 2016. We've crafted a strategy which allows us to serve the needs of the market today but positions us to address the ongoing needs of patients, medical providers, hospitals, retail outlets and all of our partners in a system undergoing change. Long-term value creation is our true north. Our healthcare system is at a key inflection point and with the ongoing convergence of historically disconnected players, customers increasingly see Cardinal Health as an integrated and effective healthcare organization, not a collection of individual business units. The strong performance of the enterprise wasn't the product of a single business unit or function. It was rather the collective energy and dedication of 35,000 people who are extraordinarily committed to their customers, to patients, to our business partners, and to the performance on which they know investors have come to depend. We will not rest on our progress; as we begin our fiscal 2016, we expect to continue our track record of growth and value creation. So, let me make a couple of quick comments about the fourth quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail, and describe specifically how we see our positioning in the market and why we expect to continue our growth trajectory. We finished fiscal 2015 with a very strong fourth quarter. Revenues increased 20%. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 33%, and we recorded non-GAAP earnings per share of $1, an increase of 20% over the prior year. Also, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire Harvard Drug, which strengthens our capabilities in generics, broadens our telemarketing reach, and of course, adds scale to our Red Oak joint venture with CVS Health. Of particular note, our Pharmaceutical segment had an exceptional quarter, which you've seen in our press release and which Mike will cover in a few minutes. This is truly a remarkable time in healthcare and Cardinal Health is poised to excel while the industry evolves. We're now beginning to see a clearer picture of how our newer industry dynamics might affect the future. Let me describe some of these forces and link them directly to the work that we're doing and how we position our business portfolio, our product lines, and our capabilities to grow in alignment with these dynamics. First, there's a noteworthy and increasing bifurcation in the Pharmaceutical world. We see continued growth in the utilization of generic drugs and a new era of innovation in Specialty Pharmaceuticals addressing the needs of unique patient populations that require a very integrated approach to patient management. Recognizing this, we expanded and continue to grow and diversify our customer base; in particular, we are broadening the number of customers who source generics from us. And of course, we established Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health, which was fully operationalized this fiscal year. This is an effective, productive and profitable partnership, and we see this is as a long-term driver of value for us, CVS Health, our manufacturing partners and of course, our customers. We've significantly grown our Specialty business and completed the acquisition of Metro Medical, enhancing our reach and expanding the therapeutic areas we serve. And we continue to deepen our relationships with biopharmaceutical manufacturers with valuable offerings in regulatory sciences, patient access and support, and health economics outcomes research. Second, we are seeing retailers, big and small, continue to expand their offerings and enhance their role in healthcare. Increasingly, they have become places where care is actually delivered and where healthcare counsel is provided. These retail pharmacies need to operate at significant scale or leverage the scale of a partner to ensure efficiency and access. With the proven strength of our brand and generic programs, Cardinal Health offers the opportunity to aggregate demand for our customers. We provide access to innovative tools, technologies, specialized services and solutions, including network inclusion. We now have nearly 6,000 customers in our Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization, we call that PSAO; we re-contract on their behalf for network inclusion. Without question, Red Oak Sourcing provides tremendous support enabling a world-class generics program for our customers. Third, we are seeing hospitals and health systems become increasingly complex, multi-site and multi-provider. This creates new challenges for them and puts a priority on coordination, efficiency, and standardization around various needs, including pharmaceuticals, consumables, physician preference items, and the accompanying services around these products. This creates unique opportunities for us. Partners like Cardinal Health who can serve these needs across a highly distributed system and who can help ensure the right care in the right part of the system will be highly valuable to our manufacture partners and providers alike. Integrated delivery solutions group works across health systems to build formulary capabilities and offer medication therapy management to ensure that each patient starts and stays on the right medicine. Our consumables portfolio addresses the need for efficiency and standardization, and our Cardinal Health branded products continue to grow. Our acquisitions of AccessClosure, Innovative Therapies, and, of course, the planned acquisition of Cordis offer real solutions around efficiency and standardization, combining products and innovative services and technologies. Simply put, we can eliminate waste and improve outcomes in the physician preference item area. And we are very excited to have joined forces with Henry Schein to more efficiently and effectively serve small physician practices, many of whom are now affiliated with IDN. Combining our tools with Schein's world-class capabilities and servicing office-based practices makes us a stronger partner for integrated system and allows us to move more of our Cardinal Health branded products through more channels. Fourth, as the baby boom population moves into their 60s and now their 70s, many are living with multiple chronic diseases and therefore, need new and different forms of care. These patients are being treated indifferent and what we internally refer to as peri-acute settings. The moment of discharge is a unique moment in our healthcare system and transitions to post-acute settings are extremely important. We know that many of these patients are best cared for in their own homes where they can have the dignity and support they deserve. The strength of our Cardinal Health at Home platform continues to grow bolstered by increased penetration of Cardinal Health branded products. And we are in the process of launching our Hospital Quality at Home initiative which allows consumers the opportunity to purchase a product they've used in clinical settings from retail outlets. And finally, we are seeing payment models changing, shifting the focus to outcomes rather than activity; results, not effort. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services set clear goals and timelines to shift Medicare to value-based models. In recent weeks, CMS announced their first mandatory targets for bundled payments starting with lower extremity procedures. The move to expand our position in cardiology with products offered by Cordis and AccessClosure, in wound management with Innovative Therapies, and then trauma with Emerge all align perfectly with these developments. Our ability to serve these bundles with products and innovative services now across multiple therapeutic areas is a key differentiator; highly valuable to our provider partners and will be key driver of growth for us. With a strategic eye on the future, identifying and embracing evolving industry dynamics, Cardinal Health is uniquely positioned to create value in this new environment. We are an integrated healthcare company delivering solutions to our customers across the entire continuum of care, addressing critical challenges around efficiency, costs, quality, access and outcomes. So, what do we expect going forward? This morning we provided FY 2016 guidance of $4.85 to $5.05 which represents an 11% to 15% growth rate. We expect to see growth along multiple dimensions. Without question, generics remain an important strategic focus for us, and we expect that Red Oak will continue to generate meaningful value for us and for our customers. As I mentioned before, we closed the acquisition of Harvard Drug in early July. This will further fuel our growth in generics. Our Specialty business continues its strong growth, and we expect that Specialty Solutions will finish fiscal 2016 with revenues in excess of $8 billion. We expect our Medical segment to grow at mid-single-digit rates and finish the year with momentum. Of note, the Medical segment will have a challenging first quarter as a result of some discrete items, the largest being the wind down of a post-spend CareFusion contract in Canada which Mike will cover. Nevertheless, we continue to expect higher than market growth in our strategic accounts and double-digit growth in our Cardinal Health branded Medical products. We anticipate outgrowing the market in Cardinal Health at Home and look with enthusiasm to closing the acquisition of Cordis likely in our fiscal future. China continues to represent a significant opportunity. The healthcare market in China is still in its early phases of growth and our large and expanding footprint will be increasingly valuable to us and our global Pharma and Med Tech partners. Finally, having made some important moves in these last 18 to 24 months, we will prioritize and focus on execution and performance management around these strategic priorities. And because of this, expect that our capital deployment approach in the near term will be weighted toward reinvesting in our existing businesses and enhancing enterprise capabilities to ensure that we maintain the kind of impressive earnings growth we've experienced over the last one, two, and five years. We come out of fiscal 2015 with a strong track record of financial performance and a balanced, well-positioned portfolio. We have high expectations and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver robust growth demonstrated by real and measurable results. Let me finish by thanking all of you for your support, all of our customers and business partners for their trust, and all of our employees who work incredibly hard day-in and day-out to set the industry standard of excellence. Great people make great companies, and great companies make for great communities and in that regard, our people set a high standard. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George. I'm extremely pleased to report such an outstanding quarter and a terrific fiscal 2015. The financial performance of the enterprise along multiple dimensions : revenue, operating earnings, cost control and EPS growth all point to tremendous attention to high performance by our team. At the same time, we continued a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment which served us well this year and in the years to come. Now, let me review our strong fiscal 2015 results. I'll focus on our Q4 performance and provide select full-year highlights then I'll offer our fiscal 2016 outlook including some of the underlying assumptions. You can refer to the slide presentation on our website as a guide to this discussion. Starting with the consolidated company financials, Cardinal Health had a strong finish to an excellent year. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1, a 20% growth versus the prior-year quarter. This contributed to full-year, non-GAAP EPS of $4.38, a year-over-year growth of 14%. Fourth quarter revenues came in at $27.5 billion, or a growth of 20%, and full-year revenue grew 13% to $102.5 billion. Gross margin dollars were up over 16% in the fourth quarter and increased 11% versus the prior full year. Gross margin rate in the quarter compressed slightly due to the Pharmaceutical segment growing at a faster rate than the Medical segment. SG&A expenses in the quarter and year increased largely as a result of acquisitions. We drove strong growth in consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings, up 33% in the quarter and 16% during the year. Non-GAAP operating margin rates expanded 20 basis points in the quarter and 7 basis points for the full year. Net interest and other expense increased as anticipated versus the prior year's quarter primarily due to the new debt issuance to fund the Cordis and Harvard Drug acquisitions. As we expected, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was unusually high at 42.2% due to certain federal and state tax matters. The full-year rate was 37.2%. Our fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 333 million. Full-year diluted weighted average shares were 335 million, nearly 10 million lower than the last year. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to pull forward fiscal 2016 share repurchases and bought $350 million worth of shares. This brought our fiscal 2015 share repurchases to over $1 billion. At fiscal 2015 year-end, we had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Moving on to consolidated cash flows, we generated $868 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the full year cash from operations to over $2.5 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments. Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of $4.6 billion of which $423 million were held internationally. As a reminder, our cash balance included $1.5 billion in proceeds from our recent debt issuance, which in combination with an additional $1.5 billion of cash on hand, will be used to fund Cordis and has been used to fund the Harvard acquisition which closed in early July. In addition, remember that we like to keep $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash on-hand as the scale of our business can require large daily fluctuations and cash needs. Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. The segment had outstanding performance in the quarter and the year. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 23% to $24.7 billion driven by growth in our existing and new customers. Full year Pharmaceutical segment revenues were $91.1 billion, an increase of nearly 14% versus the prior year. Segment profit increased by 42% in the fourth quarter to $535 million. This performance was driven by our generics program, which included volume growth in our customer base, as well as excellent execution by our colleagues at Red Oak. On the year, segment profit rates expanded 12 basis points to 2.3% driven by our generics program and continued focus on expense management. Moving to our Medical segment; this quarter, revenues grew 2% to $2.9 billion due to contributions from acquisitions and growth in our Cardinal Health at Home platform. This was partially offset by declines experience in Canada. For the year, revenues grew 4% to $11.4 billion. Fourth quarter Medical segment profit increased 7% to $103 million. This growth came from the expansion of our Cardinal Health brand products and services through a combination of acquisitions and organic efforts, coupled with targeted cost reductions. For the year, segment profit dollars decreased 2.6%, and the rate compressed to 3.8% due to the portfolio mix George discussed earlier as well as the impact of the Canada business. Let me share a quick note on Cardinal Health China, which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China generated over $3 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in strong double-digit top and bottom line growth. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves and we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 healthcare distributors in China. If you review the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on slide number eight, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.12 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs which reduced our GAAP results by $0.18 per share. We also had proceeds of $56 million in pre-tax antitrust settlements that are included in the $0.08 net litigation recoveries line. These were excluded from non-GAAP results. With a strong fiscal 2015 behind us, let's turn to our fiscal 2016 outlook. In early June, we provided you with our preliminary fiscal 2016 guidance range. I'll now go through our refined outlook including our current expectations and relevant, underlying assumptions. We expect consolidated company revenues to grow in the low-double digits and as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.05. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do expect our earnings to be more back half-weighted in fiscal 2016. This will become clearer as I walk through the segments. Let me first start by providing Pharmaceutical segments' specific expectations and assumptions. We expect robust revenue growth in the low-double digits versus the prior year. The anticipated drivers of revenue include branded manufactured drug price increases similar to what we experienced in fiscal 2015, the incremental increase related to new customer wins and healthy growth from both Specialty and the China Pharmaceutical business. For our generics program, overall we expect a positive year-over-year earnings contribution. This growth will be driven by several factors such as current customer penetration, new customer wins, execution of new launches, the manufacturing pricing environment, and of course, execution at Red Oak. Speaking of Red Oak, it has been a great success. As we've mentioned, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger pre-determined payments beginning in fiscal 2016. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we will be making our first $10 million-additional payment to CVS Health in this first quarter of fiscal 2016 for a new total quarterly payment of $35.6 million. Our fiscal 2016 outlook also assumes overall generic unit growth versus the prior year as a result of growth in existing customers as well as the incremental impact of the new customers that we on-boarded in fiscal 2015. In addition, we are assuming a lower year-over-year contribution from new item launches as well as the moderating generic manufacturer drug pricing from what we observed in fiscal 2015. Again, we feel very positive about our outlook for our generics program and expect the second half to be stronger based on the way we see the various components of our program shaping up. Fiscal 2016 will also include a full year of the Harvard acquisition, which closed in early July. We expect this to ramp through fiscal 2016 resulting in non-GAAP EPS accretion of greater than $0.15 per share net of the $0.03 to $0.04 of its interest expense for the related debt financing. As I just mentioned, we expect Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions to be a solid contributor to performance in fiscal 2016. Last year, we told you that Specialty was on a trajectory to exceed $5 billion in revenues in fiscal 2015. The business surpassed that goal and we continue to expect robust organic growth. Along with the acquisition of Metro Medical, we now expect to end fiscal 2016 well in excess of $8 billion in revenues. Rounding out our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions, we are also planning for double-digit growth in our China business. Now, let's talk about our expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal 2016. We expect revenues to grow mid- to high-single digits, driven by Cardinal Health brand product growth which includes Cordis, our China Medical business, and Cardinal Health at Home. For the full year, we expect mid single-digit segment profit growth due to the same drivers. Now let me give you some additional insight into the cadence of the Medical segment performance as we work through a year with multiple moving parts. The segment profit growth I just mentioned is significantly back-half weighted due to the anticipated timing of the close of Cordis, lapping of the previously-mentioned contract losses in Canada, and the timing of the continued ramp of Cardinal Health brand products which includes the launch of both new products and expansion of existing product lines midway through our fiscal year. Let me expand a little bit on these items. First, regarding Canada, for the first quarter we expect a $10 million discrete year-over-year headwind related to the winding down of the CareFusion contract that George mentioned earlier. Also, there are other smaller puts and takes that, combined with the wind down, will result in a first quarter year-over-year decline in the high teens for the segment. Even with these factors, the Medical segment will grow segment profit by mid-single digits. So while the first quarter and half will be down, our strong second half will result in full-year growth. Since Cordis is an important contributor to our stronger second half, I'll provide the assumptions included in our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect to close the Cordis acquisition before the end of the first half of fiscal 2016 and we expect an inventory fair value step up of $0.13 to $0.15 that will reduce non-GAAP EPS in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2016 and be substantially complete by the fourth quarter. Based on this timing, we would expect meaningful contribution from Cordis in the fourth quarter. Let me finish by highlighting a few key corporate assumptions for the year. We expect net interest and other expense of $195 million to $210 million which reflects the mid-June debt issuance related to the funding of the Cordis and Harvard acquisitions. We are projecting an overall non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 35.5% to 37%. As a reminder, we only provide full-year guidance on tax rates as they can have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discussions with state, federal, and international authorities. We also expect amortization of intangible-related assets from acquisitions closed as of June 30, 2015 to be approximately $194 million or about $0.36 per share. This does not include amortization for Harvard or Cordis. We will update this assumption throughout the year as that information becomes available. Moving on to capital deployment, for FY 2016 our strategy remains consistent with recent years. As we have stated, we view reinvestment in the business as a priority. During the year, we expect capital investment to increase to the range of $510 million to $540 million. This is higher than our historical run rate as this year we have identified opportunities to invest in strategic priorities, refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment and support our recent acquisitions. While we regularly evaluate opportunities to redeploy capital into the business, longer term we expect capital expenditures to return to historical levels. We also remain committed to growing our differentiated dividend in line with our long-term, non-GAAP EPS growth rate. We will also continue to explore opportunities to pursue strategic M&A with a bias towards executing on the integration of the recent acquisitions. And as always, we will continually evaluate opportunistic share repurchases as part of our balanced capital deployment approach. For fiscal 2016, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding between 334 million and 336 million. As I mentioned, this reflects a pull forward of approximately 350 million of share repurchases that were just completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. I know we just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions, so please, please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. In sum, fiscal 2015 was an excellent year for Cardinal Health and I'd like to acknowledge our team for the work they've done and continue to do to make us successful. I feel confident with our plans for fiscal 2016 and look forward to the year ahead. I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. And for our first question we go to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess I'll start with the obligatory generic inflation question. I know your directional assumption around generic drug manufacturer pricing to moderate versus fiscal 2015 is in line with what you guys have been saying, but I guess I am curious just around order of magnitude. Have you guys seen anything change in the marketplace more recently that would've made you think of this as less of a tailwind and for your fiscal 2016 than what you guys had been kind of signaling to us over the last couple of quarters? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bob. It's George. I think, why don't I let Mike start with that and then maybe I'll follow up with a little bit of color. But Mike, you want to just start with it? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, absolutely. Hey thanks, Bob, and good morning. As we said in the past, these are generic inflation can be incredibly lumpy. It's not very consistent month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. So while we are telling you that we believe that it will moderate for our fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015, we're not really seeing anything, in large changes in the environment. All the things that we've seen in the past such as the launch schedule not being where it was in the later 2000s, delays for product introductions, we're not seeing lots of new competitors necessarily in the marketplace. All those types of things that we've talked about in the past, we're not really seeing any changes, we're just trying to probably be a little bit conservative to let folks know that we do expect it to moderate a little bit over the next year. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me just echo a little bit of this. I don't know that I'd be able to describe, Bob, a meaningful change since we last reported, other than of course some very large announcements of transactions among the manufacturers. So just \u2013 I'm always reminding people on this question that you have to remember each product is sort of its own market with its own characteristics. How complex is the drug that's being manufactured? Is there plenty of raw material? Where is the drug used? How many players? What's happening for their overall business? So, there are a lot of moving parts in this but I think our general perspective is, and I think we've said this last quarter, but just to moderate our assumption going forward a bit. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No. I think that's fair. And I guess just my follow up on the cash balance, Mike, I appreciate the breakdown you gave of where you guys are and what's earmarked for what. But I guess if I go through some of the adjustments and then factor in the CapEx guidance you gave, it doesn't really look like you have too much flexibility for deployment. Anything you can share on cash flow generation expectations and I guess if my math is right, when do you guys feel like you'd be back in a position to either pursue meaningful deals again or meaningful buybacks? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Really fair question. As we take a look at it, a couple of things. I would say that I'm very comfortable with our ability to continue to do acquisitions even today if we needed to. We have access to a lot of different sources of funding, I wouldn't be uncomfortable with putting more debt on the balance sheet if we needed to if we found the right strategic opportunity. Again, that all being said, we're going to really be focused on execution this year. We've really set the table well, I believe, this past year with some really key acquisitions; particularly Harvard all ready and Cordis to close. We're going to focus on that execution and we're going to be really balanced again in our approach with capital. And so, I know, George, you'd probably like to say a couple... George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Just really quickly. Bob, I think we've done, generally over the last years pretty well in terms of our ability to generate cash, and our team is incredibly good at managing working capital. So, I think we feel confident about the way that we'll generate cash and, of course we'll think carefully and opportunistically about ways of deploying that capital should that occur. I also just want to finish that last part just to remind you that we recognize how hard it is for you all to model generics. And so I know it's frustrating, we've tried to do as best we can to get some general color, but I just want to acknowledge that. But again, I feel our general strategy on capital deployment has not changed. We feel very good about the way we'll be able to generate cash and to the extent that we're generating more cash, we'll be thoughtful and creative and certainly opportunistic. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate all the comments. Thanks. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Bob. Operator, next question? Operator : And for our next question, we go to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks and good morning. Hey, George. I just wanted to follow up on some comments you made in your prepared remarks. I think you seem to suggest that your capital deployment would be weighted towards your existing businesses and I just want to be clear on exactly what you're seeing. Do you believe it's just going to be CapEx, internal CapEx, towards the businesses that you've already bought or are you somewhat suggesting that you'll also consider doing acquisitions that may complement some of the existing businesses that you have internally? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning, Glen. Thanks. Yeah so a couple of things. One is we want to make sure that you all know that we've got a very high priority on executing the business, particularly on some of the moves that we've made. So, we want to make sure we're all over those and that we're doing the things that we need to do to make sure that those things happen the way we want. We will, of course, continue to look for opportunities that we think drives strength in the businesses that we have. So, that's largely what we're saying. Again, number one, a high priority on execution. We've deployed some capital, we want to make sure that we do that very efficiently. And second, of course we're always looking for those opportunities to sort of double down and get stronger in areas. But I hope that answers the question. Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Maybe if I just follow up with a question for Mike on the guidance. Mike, it kind of sounds like listening to the way you characterize it, there is no capital deployment really built into your new guidance assumptions. If we're not going to model acquisitions and it seems like based on the share count that you're providing you're assuming no share repurchase as well. Is it a fair characterization to assume that the guidance includes no capital deployment? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, it's a+ fair question. When you take a look at the assumptions, obviously, you can take a look at the fact that I mentioned that we were planning to do about $350 million of capital deployment this year in FY 2016, but we decided to go ahead and pull that forward opportunistically into the fourth quarter. So it is a fair assumption as you take a look at the metrics that we've put out and assumptions that we would have obviously a limited amount of capital or stock buyback this year. But again, you have to remember that's very early in the year. We're going to generate strong cash flows this year and we're going to take a look at all of our capital deployment policies and if there's opportunities in the year to buy back stock opportunistically we won't hesitate to do that. Operator : Our next question, we go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. So, my first question is around kind of the generic programs. In the prepared remarks you emphasized kind of like the growth and momentum that you're seeing there. So, can you quantify for us how fast is your generics program growing and how it compares to what you're seeing market growth is? And how does Harvard fit in? So, when you think about fiscal year 2016, do you separate the \u2013 is the Harvard accretion includes also the contribution to generic or do you think about it as kind of like supporting your growth of your generic program separately? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Ricky. I would say Harvard's really both. I mean, Harvard brings to us generic scale, which is always important particularly with the excellent performance we're seeing from the Red Oak team. It also brings to us new telemarketing skills and teammates. It also had some private label brands that we're going to take a look at how we can continue to leverage those in the acute space. So Harvard brings several different capabilities to us that we're excited about and we've had an excellent team in the telemarketing, in that packaging area, over the last couple years that have executed incredibly well. So, I would say it brings both capabilities as well as generic scale to us. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Broadly, Ricky, good morning it's George. Our generic program is doing very well, and I think we can safely say we're outgrowing the market. There are a lot of components to that. I think we've gotten a broader base of customers who see us as a primary source for generics. And I think we're doing well with them getting better share of wallet, meaning I think we're creating value for a very, very broad percentage of their overall mix. We've had a little bit of customer growth. The overall picture has been very encouraging and as Mike said, I think Harvard will just add to that. One other thing to add on Harvard, we do really have some interesting synergies because we're very, very good at this today and so this sort of goes right into our sweet spot where we can leverage capabilities that we have in telephony and salesforce productivity in that \u2013 in our telemarketing group. So, we're really excited to sort of bolt that into the system. But it'll very much fold in. But we are calling out a specific accretion that we see from that acquisition. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow up will be on the Specialty side again. Seems like a pretty impressive step-up in revenue contribution right from $5 billion to $8 billion. So, can you maybe share some more detail on what you're doing, kind of like what's the revenue model, how are you working with manufacturers, are you also kind of like earning fees from manufacturers for the support services or is it just kind of like for the distribution? So, as much color as possible would be great given that significant step up that we've seen in the contribution... George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Ricky, let me start and with more general comments then but I'll let Mike give a little more detail. Specialty has been a really good growth story and much of that organically. Now Metro Medical, as Mike said, will contribute a lot to those increased revenue numbers as we go from $5 billion to $8 billion. But a lot of this has been organic. Most of the revenue growth has come from the provider side, just growing the number of customers that we supply across therapeutic areas. That's been the primary driver over these the last couple of years. I do think that we've increased the capabilities that we have to serve Pharma and Biotech and those tend to be less impactful on the top line but more impactful in terms of margin rates to different kinds of services and more consulting kind of revenues. So, I think it's been a good mix of components. But I would say a lot of the revenue has come from expanding our provider base. Mike, what else? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I'd absolutely agree with that. And I think that's really coming from our service offerings in that space. I think that the team over the last several years has done an excellent job of creating offers that we think are best-in-class for either the oncologist, rheumatologist and nephrologists that we're serving and we have a lot of participation with them where they come here, often to Columbus, work with us to help us develop our products and services. I think we're doing an excellent job of listening to what they need and delivering the types of services that they need to get them comfortable to turn over their distribution to us. Operator : For our next question, we go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Oh, yeah, thanks for taking questions. First, just had a quick clarification, I know you said that in the reconciliation of the non-GAAP, you backed out the litigation recovery. Is that the same when I look at the presentation for the Pharma segment that excludes also the gain there as well? And then my follow-up question really is more about China actually. When you talk about the China Medical, just curious what's in that part of your business? What do you do on the Medical side in China? Mostly, we've talked about the Pharma distribution there, just curious, and Specialty in China. Just understand in what's there and what percent of the mix in China that kind of represents? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Great. I'll start on the settlements and then turn it over to George for a little discussion on China. Yeah that $56 million of funds that we received in the antitrust settlement have been excluded throughout all the numbers that I talked about. They're not in our overall non-GAAP numbers, nor are they in any of the results of the Pharmaceutical segment. We see these as generally non-recurring hard-to-predict type of items and we have carved these out for years. They have always been carved out of our numbers historically and it's just a consistent pattern that we've had over the past. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Charles, I'm sorry, did that get what you needed from... Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, absolutely. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: That helps. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : On China, just a couple of quick observations. We started in China acquiring a business that was roughly $1 billion and growing to nearly $3 billion at the end of FY 2015. It's really been growth along multiple dimensions. Certainly, our Pharmaceutical distribution is the biggest generator of revenue for us in China. We are doing \u2013 increasing med tech work and sometimes just as a 3PL player for medical device companies. I think increasingly people see us as a broad-based healthcare partner in China. And you've seen that in Specialty where we've set up some pharmacies to actually deliver Specialty products direct to patients. We now have 30 of those direct-to-patient pharmacies in China. So the growth has been along multiple dimensions. But again I'd say probably in terms of revenue, the primary revenue growth driver is still in the Pharma segment. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : For our next question we go to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Hey, George, a high level question for you. In the past, you haven't been too enthusiastic about entering the distribution space in some parts of the world as others. But how does the ongoing consolidation among Pharma manufacturers impact your view and if it's not in M&A, how does manufacturer consolidation influence your thinking in any other meaningful way? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Garen. Manufacturer consolidation is not really a new story. It's certainly accelerated a lot in the last couple of years both on the branded side and on the generic side. It probably has not changed our view about the opportunities that we have to grow our business both in the U.S. and globally. We look very carefully and I think we've got pretty good experience, line of sight, and discipline around how we see the opportunities of our markets. And our relationships with our Pharma and Biotech partners are very deep; like we're talking regularly about opportunities. So we'll continue to look at opportunities around the world, but we'll do it with a very disciplined eye to make sure that we really believe that there's value creation there, that we bring something to the table and that it's a necessary growth driver for us. China's been a great opportunity. We now have a platform with Cordis to grow certainly on the Medical side in a number of markets and we'll continue to look to see whether or not there are opportunities ex-U.S. that are attractive to us. But I do think when we look at service businesses in multiple markets, you need to do that with a very, very discipline eye; for example, Europe is not Europe, it's probably got four different kinds of markets inside that broad economy. And so we'll look very carefully at those and with I think a very experienced set of eyes. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. So, it sounds like more of a status quo. And then secondly you could elaborate a little bit on the Red Oak milestone payment? The $10 million that you mentioned, (51:39) you had mentioned that based on the savings that there would be additional milestone payments. But is this something that is a quarterly payment and is it more of an automatic payment for this amount once the savings have been captured or is it as a percent of savings where this amount could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : That's a great question. Let me give you some color and transparency on this arrangement with CVS Health. So the way the deal is structured so that at the beginning of FY 2016 there was a milestone where we would do a measurement. If we were able to exceed that milestone, then a $10 million per quarter payment would kick in to CVS. It's a very binary event. It's either pass the milestone, pay $10 million or you don't and you pay $0. So, there's no proration or anything about it. It's just either pay the $10 million or you don't. This milestone is tracked each quarter. It's run every quarter and so it could, theoretically, we could pay one quarter and not pay the next. But our anticipation is that we will pay the $10 million per quarter each quarter this year. So our payments, to be very clear, are $35.6 million per quarter for FY 2016. For FY 2017, then there's another calculation at the beginning of FY 2017. It is also another binary event. If we pass that additional milestone, we would pay another $10 million per quarter. And so, now, it's too early to talk about that milestone, we'll wait until the beginning of 2017. We'll measure it at that time but if it's surpassed, again, it's a binary event; it would either be $0 or $10 million per quarter, additional for 2017. So, our payment could go as high as $45.6 million per quarter starting in FY 2017 and then that would be the maximum for the life of the deal. There's no other milestones. There's no other additional payments. And just also to emphasize, there's no adjustments for volume up or down, whether CVS wins or brings in more business or Cardinal wins or loses business; it is a fixed payment for the rest of the life of the deal. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I'd probably just add to that. The good news is that both of us have been actually contributing nicely to the capacity and the volume going through Red Oak. So, it's been hopefully a rewarding deal for both of us and, of course, for our customers. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And a quick follow-up on that milestone though. Does that milestone \u2013 does it become a more difficult milestone per year or does it become an easier bogey to hit just because maybe the low-hanging fruit was captured first so the milestone just becomes easier for \u2013 just easier overall? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean just think about it this way. It's just, again, a level of savings and we build it such that you would want us to pay the additional $10 million milestone next year. And we're, again, very confident in the execution of Red Oak and we'll get back to you in 2017 as we do the calculation and when we set guidance for 2017 and discuss it. We'll let you know whether that milestone was achieved. Operator : We go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. I just had a couple of follow-up questions, Mike, on the guidance as we think about the two different components. First, on the distribution side of the business can you maybe just talk about what your assumptions are around the underlying organic growth? And then secondly, I didn't hear you discuss at all margins and how to think about margins in that business as we move towards 2016. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : So are you talking specifically about the Pharma segment, the Medical segment? Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Let's start with the \u2013 like, I just want to understand the organic components around each so what are your assumptions for each of them for the underlying organic and then more specifically to the Pharma, do you have anything built into your anticipation based on some of the announcements that CVS has made around acquisitions that they're contemplating in your guidance for 2016? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I guess... George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : So I guess first of all, we would not comment on any acquisitions related to CVS other than what comments they've made which is that they fully expect the acquisitions that they do, the generics there, to be sourced through Red Oak in the future. But other than that, I can't speak to that component of it. As far as revenue assumptions for the segments, on the Pharma side, we did talk about really \u2013 first of all, we expect branded inflation which is a key driver of revenue in the Pharma segment to continue to be similar to what we saw in FY 2015. We expect to see double digit growth from China and Specialty in the Pharmaceutical segments and we expect to see growth from our existing customers as well as we'll have full-year onboarding of some of the new customers that we won last year. So those will be the big drivers on the revenue side and we don't guide to margin or margin necessarily rates on the Pharma side but that from a revenue perspective, those will be the key drivers for Pharma. On Medical, we're also, as we mentioned, we're going to see mid- to high-single digit percentage revenue growth versus the prior year and that's going to be driven by growth created from the Cordis acquisition as well as growth in our branded products through some of the internal efforts that we've had to grow those lines, launch new products as well as some of the efforts we've had around acquisitions. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Sorry \u2013 what I'm really trying to get at is \u2013 so first on the Pharma side, what's your expectation in your existing book of business maybe around utilization? So I understand all the components that you talked about with brand and new wins, Specialty, et cetera, but I'm just trying to understand like the core underlying business. What's your expectations as to where that's growing right now? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Lisa, let me start, first of all, good morning. It's hard to sort of break out underlying business. Let me give you some general broad perspectives on what we see in the market. Pharmaceutical utilization continues to go up, so prescriptions are going up. At the moment, it appears that we have been outgrowing the market a bit. That's probably a little bit of increased customers. It has to do with the way our existing customers are doing in the market. So, the underlying health of that actually looks quite positive. On the Medical side, we're continuing to see a little bit of a trend of movement of care from acute care to ambulatory settings. So, we're not projecting a lot of increased utilization in the acute care setting; although actually if you talk to some hospital systems versus other, they're seeing it. So again, it is choppy and it varies from system to system. But we are seeing a general movement of care into the more ambulatory setting. So, our general position, our strategic accounts, for example, we continue to do very well. We did well this past year, our expectations for the year going forward are positive on that. So, the underlying characteristics of how we're doing in our market to me all sort of go green, they look pretty good. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then I think the reason I was asking about the margin expectations are \u2013 just is there anything unusual or anything we should be thinking about differently between the two segments because you're not giving guidance around it? Just as we're modeling going into 2016. So if there's anything you want to call out, great. If it's just kind of what we've seen historically, that's fine, too. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll let Mike start and then I might... Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean a couple of things, I think first of all, we'll continue to see growth in the Specialty space like the Hep C drugs, which we said have been margin dilutive. So, we would expect to see some continued growth there. Most of the customer wins that we talked about last year that were margin dilutive are generally being lapped this year. So, we don't have as many \u2013 those types of wins like the Catamaran and some of the other business we mentioned last year. So, I wouldn't say there's anything generally different on the Pharma side for the environment. And then obviously, on the Medical side, Cordis will have a very positive impact on our margin rates after we get through the $0.13 to $0.15 of inventory fair value step-up, Cordis is going to have a significant impact on our margin rates. But again, you're not going to see that until fourth quarter because it will be masked by the step-up. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. Let me just again, I want to be very specific. The second part I think that Mike said, obviously, Cordis has this \u2013 once we get to the step-up, this impact. I want to just make sure on the first part of what Mike said, what's happening is the revenue growth that's coming from certain kinds of branded products tend to be margin dilutive on a rate basis. So, I just want to make sure \u2013 that's the dynamic that I think all of us are dealing with which is when you see the revenue growth from some of these products, they can be dilutive to overall segment margins and because of the size of them, to total margin rate. But that's just a by-product of mix. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. And remember this growth is very capital efficient for us too and while it might be low-margin rates, it does produce dollars very capital efficiently for us. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks. Operator, next question. We're going to try to keep going to be efficient in the call. Operator : We go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I just want to follow up on Lisa's question pretty succinctly just to be clear. For fiscal 2016, there's no inclusion from servicing Target or servicing Omnicare in the guidance. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Right. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : There is no assumptions for that. No distribution assumptions for us in our guidance. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, George, kind of a crystal ball question for you. In the last 90 days, we've seen a ton of moves on manufacturer consolidation and payer consolidation in the drug supply chain. If you look forward, what do you see around retailer consolidation? You're obviously well positioned with your partnership with CVS, maybe outside of the CVS kind of tell us what do you think happens and how do you see Cardinal positioned? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is a great question. Obviously, we've seen extraordinary consolidation in multiple segments across healthcare. Retailers are pretty consolidated today. Now, again, there are going to be areas and again there are others that are probably far more qualified retailers to comment on this. So, there are probably some areas where you could see some. You might see some, for example, among mass merchants or grocery combo, grocery pharmacy companies. So, I think it's an environment in which we should expect we'll continue to see some movement here. Again, regulatory constraints are always ones that everybody needs to consider in terms of what kind of can't be done here. But I think we're really well positioned. Our value proposition to small customers is really strong, but our value proposition to these big customers is also actually really good. And so, we fell pretty well positioned. Operator : For our next question we go to David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes, congratulations on showing growth in the Medical division's operating income on a year-over-year basis. Can you maybe just talk about Cordis like maybe the types of products that Cordis sells and how you expect to continue to grow Medical's operating income really sort of in 2H 2016 and then into 2017? And what's sort of most exciting about that asset as it rolls onto your books? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, listen, the exciting part about this is really thinking about the evolution of the system. We've seen and as I highlighted in my comments some really shifting sand in a way procedures are done the way they're compensated, the way the reimbursement systems work. We believe that in a couple of areas, cardiovascular being one, orthopedics being one, wound management being one, that there's real efficiency that can be brought to the system. And that's not just about the products, although obviously the acquisition of Cordis really enhances the strength of our product line. But it's also around the service components that are combined with this. And so, if I'm a provider, and I'm now being compensated at a set price for a given procedure and I'm going to be penalized, for example, for someone returning to the hospital with a complication, I'm going to be very conscious of the most efficient way to do that. How do I bring value, how do I make sure that the entire procedure is done in the most efficient way, in the best way with the best outcome with the least likelihood of a return visit. So, I think Cordis represents a really unique opportunity. It has represented a real opportunity to take a major step forward in this. I'll just add a couple of pieces. The integration work, thus far is going really well and they're recognizing that we're two separate companies still. And there are certain guard rails that are required. We've got very strong dedicated integration teams. They've been fully deployed and the preparation work that we're doing is great. I would also highlight a really critical factor, which is at this point, we feel that we basically have the entire management team filled on a global basis. And this is a group with extremely deep immersion in med tech around specific procedures and real great knowledge of their local markets. So, I think strategically it's a very good fit particularly given some of the trends. I think our integration work is going well. And just a reminder, which we often have to tell people, remember we've been a player in Medical activity in global manufacturing for many years. And so, we have some natural capabilities in this space that I think we'll be able to bring to bear. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. And then just one quick follow up. With your relationship with CVS, I mean, is there any ability to grow there especially with Cardinal HomeHealth now that Walgreens is obviously being serviced by a competitor of yours? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, again, I have to do this carefully. Our relationship with CVS is great. We really do believe that we're creating value from one another and we'll continue to look for ways to do that and beyond that it'll be hard to give any more information. Operator : We go next to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So, maybe just two quick mechanics relative to Cordis and the Medical strategy. I guess one of those is we had some view that you would look to launch some new areas in ortho and cardio prior to Cordis later this year. Now, with Cordis expected to close in the first quarter do you expect that there'll be a joint launch of a more full bag? Do you wait until Cordis is online for that? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not sure what you mean joint launch, I'm sorry. First of all, good morning. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Of course. So, as you think about bringing more products to market, you talked about having 70% of the ortho bag, I believe, by the end of the year. Do you now launch toward the end of the year? Do you wait until Cordis has closed? And do these become Cordis branded products in the future? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No. We're moving forward. Again, think of these a little bit as two separate things. We've been moving forward on the ortho line. And I would say in the fall, in the trauma specifically we're going to be starting to roll out more effectively. Cordis, we expect to close in Q2, and then that will, again, that will be its own sort of line of activity. So, I think you can think of them as conceptually they're in the same idea around helping our healthcare partners do this more effectively. But they really are two distinct lines and they've got their own timelines associated with that. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The only thing I would add to that is you mentioned about the bag and the full bag is that the team has done such an excellent job of launching products organically of where we are \u2013 have teams that are launching products. As I mentioned, it's going to be a growth factor for us in the Medical segment. So, we have a very complete bag as it is and continue to grow that bag outside of the just the Cordis acquisition with all the efforts we have going on internally. Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. And then the follow-up is relative to getting Cordis stood up outside the U.S., how much of that will be as a independent Cardinal entity? Will there be much support ongoing from J&J? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good question, Eric. So, some of this \u2013 it's going to vary by market. So, in some markets we will have a transition services agreement that facilitates the handoff from one to the other. In other markets, we've got some capabilities that are ready and we'll actually be able to fold it in. And then in some markets we're standing up some activity where that part would've been \u2013 J&J needs to keep their existing organization. We'll do some essentially stand up of, let's say, an order-to-cash capability in certain markets. So, think of it as three kinds of buckets : one where we just have transition activities, one where we stand up some activities where we have existing operations. Good news is that we have shared goals which is that we want to make sure that we have a common customer who's well-served. So I think we're well aligned I think with J&J on is. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : We go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just one real quick one. George, as it relates to China and some of the turmoil that we've seen over there, both capital markets and liquidity wise, do you guys see any specific risks to the business given some of the economic activity over there in the short term? And conversely does the turmoil create potentially some opportunities that you might not have had otherwise to grow the business through capital deployment? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's an interesting question and I know we're running late, so I'm going to go as quickly as I can. We really don't see much change in the healthcare market as result of this. Remember, the Chinese government is really committed to getting more of its people access to healthcare and I think that drive continues to be there. So, we continue to feel very optimistic. As to whether or not this creates new opportunities, it's an interesting question and certainly one we're thinking a lot about. I think we're well-positioned there and healthcare is in a little bit of a different place than what people are seeing in the overall industrial economic conditions. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : We go next to John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Can you hear me? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : We hear you, John. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: It looks at this point like Specialty is about, what, 8% of your revenue. I know that was a big focus of yours, George, when you started with the company a few years ago. Is that number in line with your goals? Do you think there is a capital efficient way to move the needle up? And I'd just appreciate any other thoughts on that topic. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Hey, John. Well, I'd say this, we're really encouraged by the rate of growth, particularly in the last two years, I would say, that the first year or two were a little slower than, as we told you, than we'd like. But it's begun to ramp pretty nicely. We will always look for opportunities to strengthen our positions and activities where we think we have a real right to play and win. Again, that doesn't mean you always find those right opportunities, but we're growing organically. We certainly will be open to opportunities that exist in the market to strengthen our positions, but nothing specific to point to. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : And we go next to Bob Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Quick one. What's left on the payables and receivables front? You've had some success managing those line items. And what can you get out of Harvard from a working capital standpoint? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I would tell you it was an excellent year on working capital across all of them. We actually performed well on essentially really every lever : DSO, accounts payable, receivables, inventory, et cetera and delivered well on all of those. And now, having said that, I still think there's always opportunity in the future for us to do that. So, those will continue to be focus areas for us. You know that we've always been incredibly attentive to working capital and our balance sheet and that's not going to change. We're going to continue to have a focus in all those areas. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Can you size the Harvard opportunity though inventory-wise? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I mean it wouldn't be material in the sense of inventory dollars to the overall organization. So, really can't size it, but there's nothing there that I would point to that would be a driver. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank, Bob. Next question? Operator : And we go next to John Kreger with William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. I had a follow-up question on the Medical business. If you look at your branded products portfolio as it exists now, what sort of organic growth are you getting? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So again, this varies period to period. We continue to grow this and I'm not sure that we've given specific rates. I will share with you that we're outgrowing the market and I would expect that over these coming years, those numbers are going to continue to increase. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, George. And maybe along the same lines, so once you get through the noise of the first half of fiscal 2016 and Cordis drops in, what sort of normalized growth do you think you can get out of the Medical segment on the bottom line longer term? What sort of objectives do you have? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, again, we're not providing any new long-term guidance, John. Here's what I would say, we've got \u2013 I've told you last quarter and as we highlighted a little bit of this upcoming first quarter. We had to get sort of a couple of lumpy things here. The general characteristics of the growth drivers in that Medical business feel really right. Like we feel like we've got the talent, we've got very clear goals internally and how we're going to go after those. We think we're aligned with trends in the market. So as we start to come to the year-end fiscal 2016, I start to feel sort of a more normalized rate of progress there. And as I said, I like that portfolio and how it's shaping up. And I really do think we can leverage the strength that we've had historically in Med Surge by driving these lines of business and products. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And for our final question, we go to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : So just a few kind of quick rapid fire questions. First on the Red Oak, I just want to confirm that the JV should be accretive to your earnings every quarter within FY 2016 relative to the size of the payments, hopefully there's no annual resets or on the mechanics or something that would cause them to have big seasonal fluctuation, just want to confirm that first. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. There's still no issue related to that. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then quickly on Medical, I'm not sure if you hit this or not, but one of your peers earlier this week disclosed a meaningfully-sized contract loss for later this year. Just curious if you guys were maybe on the winning end of that or if that maybe went to another competitor? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's improper for us to comment on someone else's call here. So for, yeah, hard to comment on this. Certainly, if we had something that we need to say that's material to us, we'll try to make sure that we highlight it. But again I probably can't comment beyond that. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And finally a real quick one, for the $0.15 Harvard accretion, can you remind us just roughly how much of that again is just financially driven purely on your financing costs versus the EBITDA you're bringing in the door versus how much is more synergy-driven? Just a rough approximation on the breakdown of that through this upcoming fiscal year. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So again, the accretion we expect to be at least $0.15, there's $0.03 to $0.04 of interest expense against that. And we expect the synergies to not only come from the sourcing side, but also we think we have some real efficiencies in the way we run the business. There are some cost synergies between the various telemarketing businesses we have. We have some incredibly good metrics and analytics around our calls, and pricing in those types of things. So, it comes from several different areas where we just have a team that has a great history of execution in this area. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Steve. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. I think... Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. George Barrett for closing remarks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, folks, I know it's been a long call. So, we'll conclude by thanking all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing all of you in the very near future. Thanks again. Operator : And again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

George? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Sally, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We're off to a very strong start to our fiscal 2016. Our first quarter revenues increased 17% to $28 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 30% to $737 million. And we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, an increase of 38% over the prior year. These are strong numbers representing meaningful and measurable results in a very positive start to fiscal year. Our operating performance is a powerful indicator that our organization is creating value for our customers. With an emphasis on disciplined execution, we've competitively positioned for sustained growth for both the near-term and long-term future. With a strong quarter behind us and some better visibility to the balance of the year, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $5.15 to $5.35, which represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015. At Cardinal Health, each of our lines of business contributes to making the company as a whole better, stronger and more accountable to our customers and our shareholders. With that, as a reminder, I'll take just a few minutes to comment on our segments and the overall healthcare environment. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll provide greater detail on the quarter. Our Pharmaceutical segment had an outstanding first quarter. Revenue increased 19% to $25.1 billion. Segment profit was up 46% to $657 million. Our Pharmaceutical distribution business continues to demonstrate the highest levels of operational excellence, software product and customer positioning, and unyielding attentiveness to the needs of our customers. Most of our growth this quarter was driven by organic activities. Our world-class generic program continues to be a source of real and measurable value for us, our manufacture partners and, most importantly, for our customers. In July, we completed the acquisition of the Harvard Group, enhancing our generics business and our ability to support both retail and institutional customers. The integration of that business is going well and we feel very optimistic about achieving our financial targets. At the same time, our branded biopharma partners see us as an efficient, effective, and committed partner in getting products to market. Make no mistake, this is an extraordinary time in the pharmaceutical industry. As I said before, we are at an inflection point. We're witnessing a new way of pharmaceutical innovation. This requires a strong position in specialty pharmaceuticals. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its record of robust growth, and this quarter, delivered the highest rate of growth we've seen in recent years. The acquisition of Metro Medical is expanding and strengthening our position in some important therapeutic areas including dermatology, nephrology, and oncology. These added capabilities make us an important partner in pharmaceuticals companies, try to deepen their connections to patients with distinct needs. Turning to our Medical segment, revenues were up 2% to $2.9 billion. As we had noted in our fourth quarter call, we had expected our Medical segment profit to decline in Q1 versus the prior year a number we estimated to be in the high teens. Our fundamentals were stronger than expected, and in actuality, Medical segment profit declined 11% versus the prior year. We saw increased penetration in our Cardinal Health brand products, Cardinal Health at Home and in our service offerings. And we continue to see higher than market growth in our strategic accounts. We've made meaningful changes in our Medical segment that allow us to create more value in more ways. Our intention here is to better serve customers, who've considerably more complex needs and more highly distributed system. As we recently announced, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed our Cordis acquisition, which strengthened our ability to provide innovative, efficient and effective cardiovascular solutions for aging populations across the world. This is a key element in our physician preference item strategy. Our team did an outstanding job managing the many working parts across this global business to close the transaction dead on our timeline. Our integration teams have been working very effectively and this enabled us to serve patients around the world on day one. Many thanks to that team and our colleagues at J&J for their partnership. We welcome the global Cordis employees and their terrific leadership team, so many of whom have joined Cardinal Health. The modernization of our portfolio is particularly relevant as we see a system in which payment models continue to evolve. Now more than ever, it's critical that we have the ability to get patients the right care at the right time and in the right setting. That's why in August, we took a majority stake in naviHealth, a national based market leader in post-acute management for payers, health systems and providers. Through its predictive analytics and evidence based protocols, naviHealth helps determine the appropriate care plan for patients post discharge. This kind of predictive population management is a critical capability for Cardinal Health. naviHealth will report through our Medical segment specifically as an expansion of our post-acute offerings. However, the capabilities represent broad based technologies and skill sets, which will serve Cardinal Health across our enterprise and many of our partners across multiple channels. The recently announced proposed rule on mandatory post-acute bundling for hips and knees, CCJR and CMS's announcement last week requiring changes to discharge process, our two recent examples further evidencing a shift to value within our healthcare system. Combining Cardinal Health at Home's patient reach, our broad pharmacy capability, and naviHealth's predictive analytics at discharge positions us well to advance our value proposition of right care, right time, right setting and makes us the partner of choice for hospitals and health systems in the emerging value-based payment models. Finally, I'll make a few comments about the continuously evolving healthcare environment, focusing on the U.S. where the activity has been to say the least very dynamic. A few things remain clear. Demand for healthcare will only increase with our aging population and continued challenges in public health. And there is no place in the world where more innovative and high-quality care can be delivered than right here in the U.S. Having said this, the system needs and will continue to experience changes to make it more accessible, better coordinated, of consistently highly quality and more cost effective. As I mentioned earlier, it is also clear that we will see the emergence of some new payment models. This is one of the reasons that we're so excited about Cordis, as it further enables us to deliver both products and services, which help in the overall efficacy and efficiency of an interventional cardiovascular procedure. All this catalyzes the industry as it adapts to these changes. And we're seeing moves across the industry among many players as they try to address one or more of these forces. Our Cardinal Health moves, both organic and inorganic, have been geared towards ensuring that we are uniquely positioned to compete not only in today's environment, but in tomorrow's. In closing, I'm pleased to report an excellent start to our fiscal 2016. We feel confident we are well positioned for sustained growth well into the future. Our Cardinal Health people remain committed to creating meaningful and measurable value for our customers, our partners, patients, our communities and our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you later this month at our Investor Day in New York, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to be reporting an outstanding start to our fiscal year. During our fourth quarter call, I shared that I was confident, we had set the table well for this fiscal year, and this first quarter provides some validation. In my remarks, I'll review our first quarter financial performance as well as updated expectations for our 2016 fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew 38% to $1.38. This was led by the strong performance of our Pharmaceutical segment and aided by better than expected performance from our Medical segment, both of which I'll discuss in detail later. Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $28 billion, a year-over-year increase of 17% and total company gross margin dollars were up 18%. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by acquisition. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $737 million, an increase of 30% versus the prior year. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in at $52 million in the quarter. This increase versus the prior year is primarily due to the increase in long-term debt to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9%, which is 3.6 percentage points favorable to the prior year rate. This was due to a few net favorable discrete items that totaled approximately $0.08. We still expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%. Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 331 million, about 9 million shares less than the same period last year. We did no share repurchases during the quarter, and at the end of the quarter, our remaining board-authorized share repurchase program was about $700 million. Also during the quarter, we had net operating cash outflows of $52 million, our annual expectations for operating cash flow remain unchanged, as it is natural to see fluctuations and some shift between quarters. We ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of $3 billion, of which $480 million were held internationally. As a reminder, on October 2, we used nearly $1.9 billion to fund the acquisition of Cordis. Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment performed exceptionally well this quarter. Segment revenue increased 19% to $25.1 billion driven primarily by growth in existing and new customers and to a lesser extent the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Because of this strong Q1 growth and the performance of our acquisitions, we now expect full year Pharmaceutical segment revenue growth in the mid-teens to high-teens versus the prior year. Pharma segment profit increased 46%, to $657 million, due to strong performance under our generics program, which includes the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing. As you may recall, the first quarter of last year was the startup quarter for Red Oak Sourcing, and so there was minimal benefit in that quarter. As we lapped the initial quarter, we continue to be excited about the performance of Red Oak and the strength and positioning of our overall generics program. Segment profit margin rate increased 49 basis points in the quarter to 2.6%, driven by performance of our generics program and the acquisition of Harvard Drug. We're very pleased with this margin expansion. I do want to note that the impact of the launch and growth of certain brand products, like hepatitis C products, and the addition of certain customers will have a dilutive impact on the margin rates going forward, but are beneficial to the bottom line growth of our company. As you think about the rest of the year, let me provide you color on a few unique items that were favorable to our assumptions for our Pharma segment in the quarter. These items together were worth about $0.11. First, we had $0.08 of favorability largely from benefits related to different competitive dynamics than we anticipated for a few key generic items. The dynamics have since adjusted to expected levels. Additionally, through great execution, we were able to accelerate about $0.03 related to the integration of acquisitions ahead of schedule. Net-net, our underlying growth was really strong. As far as it relates to generic and brand manufacturer price inflation, neither were significantly different than we modeled. On our fourth quarter call, we told you that we believe the generic inflation rate would moderate versus the prior year, and this was true for the first quarter. And while branded inflation rate was slightly higher than the prior year, it was generally consistent with a low double-digit range we anticipated. During the first quarter, our Pharma segment and the team continued to execute at a high level, all this resulting in an exceptional quarter. Let's now go to the Medical segment performance. As I mentioned earlier, performance of the medical segment was better than we anticipated. Revenues for the first quarter grew 2% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in Cardinal Health brand products and our at-Home business. Of particular note within our strategic accounts, growth of Cardinal Health brand products increased in the low double digits. Also during the quarter, we had incremental revenue from a number of smaller acquisitions. However, the incremental revenue was essentially offset by the divestiture of our office-based physician business to Henry Schein. Medical segment profit decreased 11% to $101 million during the quarter, versus the high-teens guidance we had previously communicated. The primary driver versus the prior year was a decline in our Canada business, which included some unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Remember that the prior quarter included the one-time benefit of the winding down of the Canadian CareFusion business. For some additional color, if you normalize for the winding down of the CareFusion contract and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the underlying segment grew. As George mentioned, we're very pleased to have closed Cordis on October 2 in line with our original expectation. We will continue to update you on the Cordis inventory fair value step-up. And while we don't yet have complete visibility, we feel very comfortable that this step-up will not exceed our original assumptions. Turning to slide number six. You will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.23 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost. I'd like to take a moment to describe a minor technical change to the presentation of our financial statements, due to the recent acquisition of a 71% interest in naviHealth. You'll note that in accordance with GAAP, we added lines called non-controlling interest to our applicable financial statements and schedules. This reflects the 29% minority interest in naviHealth and a few other immaterial minority interest. Historically, we haven't presented these separately. This reporting differentiates our earnings from those associated with the non-controlling minority interest. As a result, references to non-GAAP EPS will refer to non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health. Looking to the rest of the fiscal year, based on our strong first quarter performance, we've increased our initial non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range which was $4.85 to $5.05 to a new range, which is $5.15 to $5.35. Our new range implies growth of 18% to 22% over the prior year. While the first quarter has had a bit of a rebalancing effect on the full year financial performance, we are still expecting a cadence that slightly shifts the scale to the back end of the year. There are a few other updates to our fiscal 2016 assumptions that I want to highlight. These changes are denoted on slide eight and slide nine. First, we now expect total company revenue growth to be in the mid-teens versus the prior year. Next, we've updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 332 million shares to 334 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 334 million shares to 336 million shares. And finally, our assumption for acquisition related intangible amortization increased to approximately $277 million or about $0.52 per share. This change is due to acquisition that closed during the quarter and doesn't reflect the impact of Cordis and doesn't affect our non-GAAP earnings. All other FY 2016 assumptions provided during our Q4 earnings call remain unchanged. In closing, we're excited about our performance in Q1, and what we see for the rest of our year. Operator, let's begin our Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. You guys gave a lot of details. Just trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the balance of the year on the core business. It looks like you're raising the full year by about $0.19, ex the $0.11 that Mike referenced as more being one-time. You beat the Street pretty handily this quarter, even ex-tax. So, is there any other moving pieces or any updates you can give us just as far as better underlying assumptions as you think about the next three quarters relative to your previous assumptions? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Bob, good morning. It's George. I'll start and then I'll just turn it to Mike. Well, I think we're coming out of Q1 with some momentum. As Mike mentioned sort of the underlying performance characteristics for us have been feeling pretty strong over these last months. And so it really runs across our lines of business. Again, we mentioned our expectations from Med, we outperformed those. We're starting to see some momentum there. Our Pharmaceutical distribution business is on a good pathway with strong momentum, and we feel like we anticipated some of the market shifts reasonably well. And I think as Mike mentioned, we modeled into our numbers some moderating and some of the pricing dynamics around generics, which we think is \u2013 we sort of got roughly right. So, Mike, I don't know what you'll want to that. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : No. I could just summarize, Bob, to maybe hopefully be hopeful. Yeah, so the $0.11 of favorability was really related to the Pharma segment. And then, from a corporate perspective, we had the $0.08 of the discrete items on the tax side, but while those are more defined as somewhat one-timers or thoughts that way, I would tell you that the underlying performance net-net of all the business is really strong and we're seeing really strong performance across all the businesses. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, that's helpful. I guess just one more as we think about the balance of the year, I think, it's well established, you guys had won a large managed care contract in the quarter. But just curious, it looks like you're raising revenue for the year, can you maybe just walk through if there was any changes around contract movement relative to your previous outlook? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say there was any real changes related to it. I think you're right that is a strong revenue top line business for us, but as we said before, we only expected it to be slightly accretive this year, when you consider all the start-up costs and everything that go along with a new live (24:17) contract like that. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : And we'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Sorry to stick on the point. I'm just trying to understand, in terms of the favorability, the way you described in terms of changes in the competitive environment, is this specifically pricing or is this some other element in maybe one or the other parts because we didn't hear this from the other players. I'm just getting a ton of questions to get a little bit more clarity on maybe not exactly what it was, but more a little bit of context. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Ross, this is George, I'll start and again Mike can clarify or correct me, if necessary. So, I think what happens is, this has to do with everybody's own internal modeling. So, the way we modeled certain products, we expect X product have X competition at various stages. And so, that's just a nature of the way we model them. So, we may have modeled for example on a given product that there are going to be a certain number of competitors. If there is one or two or more or less, then that can change. And so, when we're talking about the competitive dynamics, it's usually the number and composition of those players. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Got it. And then... Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The one thing I would add, Ross, to maybe be helpful is remember our mixes can be different than our competitors' mix too. And this really just had to do with the way we modeled a few key generic items and what our overall margin rates would be on those items, and over the first quarter, those margin rates were just stronger than we expected, but they have more normalized as we expected towards the end of the quarter and that's why we don't see those being quite the same levers going forward. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Thanks. I just want to make sure folks were clear. And then you've obviously closed on Cordis, can you talk just a little bit about sort of how the organization is responding to you bringing them in house? I'm assuming there's probably some good enthusiasm as you obviously take a little bit of a different bet on that business. And maybe talk a little bit about geographically some of the markets where you feel like you can help inflect maybe ex the U.S., any more than maybe you originally thought, because I think the original assumption was a lot of impact on the U.S. and then the sort of ex-U.S. is a little bit more left to itself. Any updated thoughts on the ex-U.S. business? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Let me get started again with the caveat, this is very, very new. We literally just closed this business a few weeks ago. But I would say the enthusiasm level is extremely high. Again, recognize that we are making this a high priority as part of our physician preference item strategy and we've had all the key leadership around the world join us. We've had meetings all over the world. The reception from the Cordis people to Cardinal has been fantastic, and really gratifying. So, I think from that standpoint, the energy level, the enthusiasm and I think the alignment with the strategy is really great, and part of that has to do with the service component of what we bring. And the ability, for example, to bring other tools that go along with the product into new markets has been really exciting. And so if you had to say to the second part of your question, where have we been, maybe a little surprise is the enthusiasm for some of the service components ex-U.S. And I'll highlight China and EMEA where some of the markets see these opportunities to help manage inventory, for example as real value drivers for their customer base. So, we're \u2013 it's very, very early, but I would say the level of excitement here and among those Cordis people who have recently joined us is pretty high. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. The only thing I would add is that, besides the \u2013 I completely agree with George, the excitement is really, really high. But just a couple of quick reminders. First of all, it did close on our target date. So, we had expected early October to be our target date from the beginning. So, we were dead on that target date. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, well, we don't have perfect visibility to every component right now of the inventory. We do have enough visibility to tell you that the impact of the inventory step-up that we had originally would be $0.13 to $0.15. We still expect that to be as a number and we do not expect any variance to the upside or it to be more expensive than $0.13 to $0.15 than we did before. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So, two questions here. First of all, obviously, there has been a lot of \u2013 we're hearing a lot about just inflation in general. You talked about your expectations for generic inflation. But can you share with us your thoughts about how you see Brent pricing inflation being impacted by all the political noise that we're hearing and also what's Cardinal's exposure to it? We've heard some different data points from your two peers last week. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, why don't I give you some quick thoughts, Ricky. First of all, good morning. Some quick thoughts on the environment and then maybe I'll let Mike just talk about our \u2013 what you call our exposure to a pricing dynamics. I'd start by the way, saying, this has been \u2013 we've a very robust and balanced portfolio and I think that always is helpful. So, let me just start, clearly, pricing in Pharmaceuticals has become a hot topic, particularly as we go full swing into the election cycle. And again, let's \u2013 with the caveat of the acknowledgement that a price of any drug could create a difficulty or hardship for any given patient, I think it's important to remind ourselves that from a system standpoint, Pharmaceutical care is still the most cost effective in the system. And it's actually roughly around 10% of our national spend on healthcare, so it gets a lot of attention. But I want to try to put in context, the thing that I'd (30:33) put in context is that with about 85% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. being generic and mostly at lower price points than brand, that's a powerful tool for keeping system cost down. And so it sort of allows the head space (30:52) to fund innovation in the system. So again, having said this, this is a highly political issue, it's a highly personal issue. No doubt companies are looking at the environment very carefully, watching the public discourse and public debate on this and I'll just assume that that's going to influence the way they think about the environment. But it's really hard to predict exactly how any company is going to respond to that. But it certainly it's very much in the news. Mike, I don't know if you want to add in terms of... Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, the only thing I would add is, remember that over 80% of the fees that we get on branded manufacturers are on the fee-for-service model, so, inflation actually doesn't matter on over 80% of the fees. So, on the portion where it does matter, we always have the option to work with those manufacturers to adjust those agreements. So if we're expecting a certain inflation rate with those suppliers and that inflation rate starts to drop, we will go back and work with those manufacturers to adjust those agreements to be able to make sure that we're earning the fees that we deserve with the services that we provide, because we still see what we do as incredibly valuable. They still see it as incredibly valuable. So there is definitely ways for us to continue to manage in an environment even if inflation rates were to moderate on branded products. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up relates to the EBIT margin for drug distribution. So, Mike, even when ex the fact the (32:25) generic benefit that you highlighted is one-time, we've seen some pretty meaningful expansion improved (32:30) year-over-year. I think we calculate about 33 basis points year-over-year if you exclude that generic benefit and also a benefit quarter-to-quarter I think. So can you just help us maybe sort it through it, I mean how did Harvard Drug maybe perform and how did they contribute on a sequential basis because what I'm thinking what was three months in this quarter versus last quarter? So if you can just help us understand the moving parts that helped drive that margin expansion? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. It's going to be hard for me to get into a lot of details there, Ricky. It's really what I was saying. It's really strong performance on our overall generics program. Obviously, Red Oak is an important piece of that, but also our customer mix, our ability to execute on launches, pricing, all the other components that make up our generic program. I will tell you that it wasn't generic inflation that was a driver in the quarter. That moderated as we said that it would moderate. And so, generic inflation was not really a driver. Clearly, Harvard was also a component of our margin improvement, so generally \u2013 those are the two biggest as I've said before, but we have a lot of other things going on. We're highly efficient. We continue to drive efficiencies in our business, which is something that we will always do. We're a distribution company. So, we're never going to lose sight of that in our Pharma side in many components of our business. So, we'll always focus on efficiencies too. Operator : The next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Co. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Sorry I missed the first couple of minutes here. But when you guys talked about the guidance here, can you talk about what your assumptions are for in terms of timing for acquisitions by CVS such as like Target and Omnicare? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We really can't comment specifically on any of the acquisitions. The only thing I can say is what we've said before is that that's a decision CVS is going to have to make on where the branded distribution will go, but remember, all of the generics on those businesses as CVS has noted are going to go through Red Oak. And so, really that's the only piece to keep in mind. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And Charles, we didn't build anything in. We don't have complete line of sight on transition timing. So that's really with CVS Health right now. So, we did not build anything in as it relates to additional value from the generic component, Red Oak component on those deals. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: So the Red Oak component is in there in the guidance, but the branded side for Target, that is not in the guidance just to be clear, right? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Just to be clear none of the branded volume is in our guidance or projections of revenue growth going forward. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research : Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Medical side of your business, your guidance previously assumed a ramp in the medical partly from the launch of new and also the expansion of various product lines midway through your fiscal year. So was there anything that went ahead of schedule this quarter? And if it didn't, can you just update us as where you are regarding the timing? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say anything really was ahead of schedule. It was just a little bit better performance in several different areas across Medical. So our Cardinal Health branded products did a little better than we expected. They did some great work focusing on efficiencies and SG&A and the kind of dilutive impact that we've been talking about on the national brand products wasn't as great as we expected it to be in the quarter. So all those areas, good management over those three areas were really the key drivers. Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research : Got it. And then maybe switching over to capital deployment and share buybacks. I thought last quarter you mentioned how you pulled in, I think it was $300 million or $400 million to buy back shares when it was around $88 a share. And you sounded pretty opportunistic in terms of buying back more. So today's $2 million lower share count sort of what you were thinking of or is there still more of an appetite to do opportunistic buybacks of shares that are around the same price range or if they reached certain thresholds? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. You're right. We did accelerate our share repurchases from this year into Q4 of last year. It was about $350 million of share repurchases that we did in the fourth quarter that we typically might have done this year. At this point in time, clearly, share repurchases are something that we will consider. Number one for us is going to be, continue to invest back in the business and we've said we would spend about $510 million to $540 million this year in capital expenditures, and we're still looking at that. We will also continue to have our differentiated dividend, and as always we're going to look at M&A and stock repurchases as opportunities. And so, there is \u2013 that's clearly on the table and something that we'll continue to look at for the rest of the year. Operator : Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning. George, I just want to go back to your comments when you talked about the shift to value based care. And obviously looking at the legislation or what CMS is doing, they're talking about hips and knees and you're talking more about cardiovascular. So I guess my question is really two parts. One, do you expect that we're going to see cardiovascular shifting in the same kind of payment methodology in the near-term? And then secondly, has Cardinal thought about your hip and knee programs and things like that you could do to have more of a private label in some of those products? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Lisa. So let me do first generally the prospective on the bundled payment program. I think it is reasonable to assume that, again with the caveat that this is early stage, that this directionally is an area that's on CMS' mind. And so, it wouldn't be right for me to predict which therapeutic areas or which procedures are necessarily going to come under bundled program. But I think it's fairly easy to imagine that the discussions in CMS are looking at a number of areas. So, we feel like the tools that we've begun to build here are valuable and will have sort of transferrable value. As it relates to the specific product lines and the specific joints in hip and knees, obviously as orthopedics is an area we've begun to move on, has an interesting characteristics. We are beginning to expand our program there. I don't really at this stage want to go into specific details about which product lines, but we do believe, as we have felt it in cardiovascular, there are opportunities to bring both the product and the service components to the market and for providers who may be living under a different payment model. Those value drivers that we create are actually even more important, that ability to help them manage that patient, the cost of the procedure, the controls in the OR or in the surgical suite and management of the inventory and even watching for that patient post-acute, those are things that I think are going to matter and we're devoting energy to those things. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so, George, when you think about \u2013 you are just putting all those tools in place to help the hospital manage, that process as we move to fee for value versus taking on and maybe I'm wrong here, but thinking about Cardinal taking on some level of risk around that patient in the future, is that correct? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't think, Lisa, I'd get into the question of exactly what model will be used as this unfolds. I think there is a lot of discussion around this system, around risk models and who bears the risk, and I think that it's very early in that process. We are developing I think tools that allow us to compete in any environment, whether environment looks a little bit more traditional or starts to evolve to some kind of shared risk model. So I think we're open minded, but building capabilities that I think are very important going forward. Operator : We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. Mike, you had mentioned in your comments that the margin in the Pharma segment would see some pressure. Can you just quantify that a little bit? It was very strong in the quarter. Can we assume that the margin percent will be up year-over-year or perhaps not? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : It's hard to say for the whole year. I'm not going to give specific guidance for the year. But I would tell you that we felt obviously great about the first quarter. But I just wanted to make sure that I gave you guys a little color around just to remind you the stuff that we have been talking about and you guys have asked questions about in the past around the hep C drugs. Those will continue as they grow. They are much lower margin rates, so they are dilutive to our overall margin rates. But again, there is a right type of things to do. We still make money on them. They're just at lower margin rates and they're very capital efficient. Same way with some of our customer mix. We have some wins that we've had that will be lower margin rates than some of our other ones. But the capital efficiency on those is outstanding as well as our SG&A leverage on those. And so, over time I just want to remind is, it's a balance. We think there is things going in the positive for us on our margin rates, and there is some things on the other side. Just wanted to try to give you a balanced view. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. John, this is really \u2013 again, this is George. This is the mix phenomenon basically. So, the fact is that the products and the customers that have been building into the portfolio, this is all good news. But the mechanics as you look at the margin rates will have this dilutive impact, but to the corporation, to the benefit, to our shareholders of creating these opportunities I think we're like 74% (43:07). John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. The very strong top line growth in the Pharma segment, could you give us any more specifics around what you view as the key drivers there? How much of that came from acquired businesses? Perhaps what sort of underlying unit growth you're seeing versus inflation? That'd be great. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Couple of different things. I would say obviously brand inflation is a key driver of the overall top line growth. Second of all would be our wins in our new customer business. We also feel like we're aligned with some outstanding customers that are existing customers and that their growth is very strong in the marketplace and so that's important to us. And then probably the fourth benefit is some of the launches of the new drugs like the hep C drug is a new category of expensive drugs. And so that's going to be another component. So, that's probably roughly four things and then I would also add acquisitions will have our component of our top line growth with both Harvard and Metro Medical relatively new this year to our overall revenue stream. Operator : Next will be Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So I think I'll extend on that last question, and this is for both George and Mike. As you think about \u2013 we've now gone through several generic ways. We have the generic inflation benefit. Has your business model become much more tied to revenue growth and absolute gross profit will be the focus and we should have less concern relative to gross margin and maybe more concern on op margin? Do you think there has been a shift in the business at this point? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me start generally and then Mike, he can be more specific on this. So I think there is a dynamic that relates to revenues that as Mike said has to do with who you serve. So part of it is we feel very good about our customer mix. There is also again a dynamic that we know relates to the pickup of some new business. So these are all sort of year-over-year contributors. As it relates to the top line being a better, which is I think what you're asking, is it a better measure than it once was given some of the dynamics. I think it's always a little bit tricky given that just the very nature of having generics in the marketplace. So at any given moment of products that those from branded generic is going to change the revenue line and so I guess we always give the caution that in Pharmaceuticals, the revenue line is influenced by the shift from branded generic. Yes, it's true there were probably fewer launches than they were in 2008, but it's still a phenomenon that affects that number. We really are focused internally on every internal measure that we can have that indicates improvement of efficiency and productivity and customer positioning. So ultimately the way that flows for you frankly is the margin of the corporation growing. And the margin rate will be affected by some of these mix issues we talked about. But really internally, we're always looking at the individual components that drive margin and that are indicators of productivity. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I would just \u2013 I totally agree with George. I think revenue is a little tricky to say is a key driver. It's always going to be something we look at. Clearly, it's been important to us. The only thing I probably add is that when you have a large revenue base like we do and we have some of these acquisitions that we have that are at much higher margin rates whether it be in P or M, you cannot see significant revenue growth, but we're able to add gross margin dollars in operating income to the bottom line. So, again, revenue is just a tricky indicator, something to consider, but there is so many other components between efficiency, growing margin rates, mix, generics, sourcing, et cetera, that are drivers that you got to look at a large group of things. Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And maybe the follow-up on that more specific to this quarter. You've mentioned Red Oak and the contribution now versus a year ago. Should we think of Red Oak as currently up and running? We know you've made the additional milestone. And when we look back to last year, is a relatively low contribution. How should we think about how that ramped up over the following three quarters, and what that does to your comparison moving off from here? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You're right. So the first quarter of last year, there was very little Red Oak benefit because that was our start-up quarter. And then Red Oak really ramped faster than we expected. The team just did an excellent job in our \u2013 which would have been our quarter two of really getting after all of the synergies and working with the manufacturers to sync up all of our purchasing agreements. And so, Red Oak has ramped up nicely in the back part of last year. As we've said in the past, we continue to believe that Red Oak will be a tailwind for us, and that it will continue to have upside. But clearly, this is probably going to be the quarter, where we're going to have the biggest year-over-year benefit just because it was essentially a start-up quarter last year. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : Your next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Congratulations on a very good quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about naviHealth? And what sort of incremental in-sell opportunity is there into your hospital base and what value could this bring to your existing hospital customers? And how will you tie this into your overall sort of analytics platform that you provide to your IDN clients? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning, David. Yeah, we're excited about this new business. We think that again if you follow what's happening both in the public and the private sector as it relates to the attention devoted to particularly post-acute and how we mange patients in a post-acute setting, naviHealth provides us just great analytical tools. Know-how and actually field-based people that are helpful in managing the discharge and the patient follow-up. So I think if you are sitting in the seat of an IDN or health system now and there is increasing attention on how you will manage those patients and how you will be responsible for those patients post-acute, I think that our value proposition with naviHealth and with the other tools that we have at Home, our pharmacy, medication therapy management, those really are an interesting combination of things. Hospitals are extremely interested right now in what we have and what naviHealth brings. And I think it's changing some of our conversations in a very positive way. Just as a reminder, there are two components to the business, one that is sort of serving the payer side as well as the provider side. So I just want to make sure I highlight that. But I would say that it is changing the discussion with many of our customers who recognize this as an emerging area of attention and one where we can provide some value. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then Mike, did I hear you correctly that excluding CareFusion and currency, the operating income in Medical would have increased year-over-year this quarter? And can we assume that to be true for next quarter as well excluding the inventory step-up charge? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : So, yeah. Segment profit for the Medical segment would have been up year-over-year if you'd excluded the prior year CareFusion one-time payment as well as foreign currency unfavorability that we experienced in the quarter. So the Medical segment would have been up. As far as go forward quarters, I can't speak specifically by quarter on how Medical is going to do, but I will tell you that the Cordis step-up, we do expect to impact Q2 and Q3 for the Medical segment. And we've mentioned that before that we thought it would take roughly two quarters that that $0.13 to $0.15 would be essentially amortized over. And then by our fourth quarter, you would see that essentially go away, and you'd see strong performance from Cordis in the fourth quarter. Operator : Next will be Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, George, and Mike. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : So I guess for me just a couple of additional questions on the brand inflation. And maybe first, just to try to better frame this, given that your antenna along with everybody's is obviously up now and just the potential for brand inflation to decelerate by let's say several percentage points in calendar 2016 versus the trend we're seeing in calendar 2015. Should we just assume this is something that would be more than absorbable within your $0.20 guidance range for fiscal 2016? And also Mike, when you said that you can go back to brand manufacturers and adjust the terms of fee-for-service contracts, are you talking, let's essentially in real time in a given quarter or is this more something that would have to be done at the end of the duration of an existing fee-for-service contract with the manufacturer? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So first of all, any deceleration that we might be assuming in our \u2013 for branded inflation rates in our Q2 through Q4 has been included in our current guidance range that we gave you. So we do expect \u2013 we still expect brand inflation to still be about what we saw last year. So, we're not necessarily assuming branded inflation will decelerate. As far as generic side, we still continue to believe that it will moderate versus the prior year. But on branded, we're still expecting it to be very similar to the prior year. On the DSAs, you're right, we would have to wait till contract and typically with the manufacturers to adjust those rates. But remember we look at each manufacturer differently. So when you think about branded inflation, on many of the vendors, the branded inflation doesn't matter, because they're 100% fee-for-service. And so the inflation rates that are really most important to us are the inflation rates on the suppliers that are the ones where we have contingent margin on those. And so as you can imagine, we talk to those suppliers quite often. We try to understand their point of view on inflation and we try to be proactive at managing those agreements if we think that we're hearing things that are going to change. So, to your point, it would be hard to change immediately, we would have to wait till the end of the contract. But over any long period of time, decelerating inflation in branded is not something that I wake up and worry about every day. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's perfect. Okay, all right. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question? Operator : We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I just want to get into the weeds just briefly on naviHealth. Is there a template for post-acute bundling that you are implicitly putting your models on or is it \u2013 how would you \u2013 how does this business model work under the various type of aggregator models? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning, John. It's George. I probably won't get into excruciating detail here or the weeds as you'd like. So again, we have two essentially customers in the naviHealth business. One is the providers, and one is the payers, and each of those contracts is different. But essentially what we are doing, the value proposition is to help them manage the optimal site of care for patients post discharge. Today, again, we are \u2013 this is very, very new, so again, we're not broadening that line in other ways. We're basically using the model as naviHealth exists. What we are doing is sort of combining this with other tools that we bring in post-discharge management through Cardinal Health at Home and through our medication therapy management. But it really has two components to it, and one as a provider to \u2013 or support business (55:47) provider and one to the payer. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets. Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning. I'll add my congratulations as well. George, kind of bigger picture question as you look at some of the consolidation throughout different points of the supply chain right now. Can you kind of talk about your view of all that activity and characterize where you see Cardinal Health sitting today? And any kind of other strategic moves that you guys might need to make to kind of jive with the different movements in the market? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning, thanks. Yeah. And look at \u2013 as I said in my prepared remarks, it's been a pretty dynamic environment. And we feel really well positioned. We have scale, we've got reach, we've got tools that I think they are valuable today, but their value in some of these emerging \u2013 with these emerging trends and forces. We've seen consolidation in virtually every part of healthcare. And as I said earlier, I think it's a response to some fairly powerful forces. We could debate the logic of any individual move that a company does, but it's clearly a chessboard that's been moving. We feel very well positioned to compete given some of the changes in the system. And we've been fortunate in that some of them that have been beneficial to us and some are neutral, but by and large, I think that we've been preparing ourselves over these last seven years for some of these forces, and it's certainly not hard to anticipate that we'd see continued consolidation. And we've seen it really along every subset of the healthcare continuum. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Mike, just kind of a technical question to start. With the fee-for-service arrangements on the branded side, are most of Cardinal's fee-for-service agreements hard dollar or are they WACC-based? And I ask that because then are they \u2013 basically are they kind of inflation insensitive is the way I'm thinking about it? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Well, they're percentage fee-based type agreements. They're typically not fixed dollar agreements. They vary by manufacturer, but so they can be different. Some have score-carding components to it where you earn more if you perform at certain levels, some are more flat. They're all across the board, but generally their base is a percentage of the cost of the products and that's how they work. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then I guess either from Mike or George, I guess can you talk about how the rolling of the Omnicare business and the Target business into Red Oak impacts your economics? And maybe if you can, I understand there is a much history to look at, but I guess can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how \u2013 as Red Oak grows? If there is anything you can give us around kind of sense of severity around how much better Cardinal's purchasing economics get. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning. This really one that's hard to answer. Here's that I would say, we know that in generics, scale matters, global knowledge matters and know-how. And so to the extent that our business grows from the growth of Cardinal Health and from the growth of CVS Health in bringing more generic products to Red Oak, I think that's only a good thing for us. I think it allow us to do a great work for manufacturers in moving their markets. It allows us to provide great value to customers. But quantifying that or giving you exact picture of how those specific deals impact us would be difficult to do. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks very much. First off, just a housekeeping item, if I missed it, I apologize. Could you possibly give us the organic and actual growth for both the China operation as well as Specialty? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Well, from Specialty standpoint, we told you that we did a little bit of over $5 billion for FY 2015 and that we expect it to be over $8 billion in FY 2016 in terms of revenue, so strong growth in Specialty. And then in China, we do continue to expect that business to continue to grow in double digits. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Grow double digits. And then my follow-up, just shifting gears quickly. Medical, I didn't catch you mentioning anything about manufacturer price increases or any special situations in the quarter. Your largest U.S. competitor in acute care did mention and has actually mentioned for three of the last five quarters, some unexpected benefits from manufacturer price increases. I'm curious if you could give us your views on that and if you also had any similar benefits. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think a part of that could be a mix between their business and our business. It was not a driver for us in the quarter at all, and so again, this doesn't mean it couldn't be for them. It may just be the timing and maybe mix, but for us, inflation on medical surgical products was not a driver for our quarter. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I actually jumped on late, but also to Eric's question on China, any potential for the one child rule being abandoned there? I guess it's 2 million more births a year. Do you see yourself as positioned for any step-up in healthcare consumption there? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Not tomorrow. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : Nine months? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It is the gestation period. Look, I think just broadly on China, because we didn't get a chance to talk about it much today. We still feel very excited about being positioned there. Obviously, China is going through some unique dynamics, certainly affecting the industrial sectors a bit more than the service and healthcare sectors. But I think in general, we talk about lifestyle changes, we'd now talk about an increased population about, Bob. And I think continue over time, it's hard to imagine that we're not going to see this as a growth environment. We should probably acknowledge there was a little bit of FX issue in China naturally, but again to the overall picture of us, not a material impact. So, we like the positioning there and we think long-term, we'll see a growing middle class, are going to come through this difficult stage. We'll see a larger population and we're happy to be positioned there. Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch : And are you involved heavily in diagnostics there at this point, George? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Not particularly. No. We do a little bit of lab supplies, but I would say it's a very small component for us. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Barrett, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thank you, Eric. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We're off to a good start to the year. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and hope to see lots of you at our Investor Day in New York. So, with that, we'll conclude. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sally. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million and we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long-term. We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change, and we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015. Both of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit. Turning to our segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. Over the past few years, we've referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in two specific areas in our Pharmaceutical business, in our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S. and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require very distinct capabilities. We continue to show excellent progress in both of these areas. As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers who recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also the broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers, which enabled pharmacists to provide clinical support both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating. As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our specialty solutions group built the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians and to help manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our specialty solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We're confident that our specialty solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016. Our Medical segment continues its repositioning and is adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. And remember, that this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step-up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year. Mike will provide more color in his commentary. The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical supplies to the home, our service offerings and discharge management all align with the trend toward value-based payment models. Related to this, it's our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across both our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge. Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been a subject of considerable economic news over these past months and while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Healthcare specifically continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle class have created increased opportunities for scaled healthcare solutions, and we expect the healthcare market in China to continue to grow. Finally, a few words on Cordis. As you know we closed the acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing all of the many moving parts across multiple markets. The integration of Cordis has gone well and is on target. Of greatest significance, on day one, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth. As the healthcare market introduces fee-for-value models, our physician preference items strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge. Our offering of products combined with business model innovation that includes services and analytics creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions, this is at the heart of our value proposition. We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well positioned for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. And seeing our people work to serve our customers through the extreme weather of the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers but also to their patients. And I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. As George mentioned, we had a strong quarter. And halfway through our fiscal 2016, we're off to a good start. We feel comfortable reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In my remarks, I first want to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then I'll end with some additional color on our expectations for the full year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.30, growth of 8% versus the prior year. Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from mid-teens to mid- to high-teens percentage growth versus the prior year. Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is three percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy. In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the six-month period was $1.4 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion with $394 million held internationally. Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet. I'll now review segment performance starting with the Pharmaceutical segment. In the second quarter the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships, and to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter. Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates. Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion targets of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal 2017. Our specialty business had strong double-digit growth which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well. Of late, many of you been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view, which is consistent with what we recently communicated at a mid-January webcasted event. We continue to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY 2016 assumptions. As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal 2015, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 2016, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing. Although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled. That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which in total, we still see as meeting our expectations. Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics, as well as executing on new item launches has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability. Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions. Now, let's go to the Medical segment performance. Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our at-Home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step-up. Excluding the step-up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%. The total step-up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2 and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step-up to recognize in Q4. In this quarter, the favorability of the step-up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some one-time items resulting from the execution of the transaction as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step-up favorability and FX to be a wash. Setting those non-operating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continue to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY 2017, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018. Switching to other pieces of our Medical business, as expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continue to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving healthcare landscape. Turning to slide number six, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. With the first half behind us, there are two variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year. The first is generic manufacturing pricing levels, and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items moving in our favor would push us toward the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we reaffirmed this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year. While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitments. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities. Operator, let's now go to the questions. Operator : Thank you. As a courtesy, please allow yourself one question and one follow-up question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Eric Percher from Barclays. Please go ahead. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. With FX called out as one of the key elements to hitting the higher end of guidance, could you speak a bit to the exposure in FX now with Cordis under your control, and some of the elements of scale or maybe impact at the top end \u2013 top line as well as offsets at the profit line and maybe also touch on Canadian exposure? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Mike, why don't you \u2013 good morning, Eric. Mike, want to grab that? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Eric. As you can imagine with a company with our breadth, not only in our commercial operations overseas, we also have manufacturing operations overseas. We are seeing FX being both positive and negative depending on which country we're talking about and whether or not we're talking about on the manufacturing side or on the commercial operations. And so, clearly with Cordis, we are getting some additional exposure with FX with 70% of that business being overseas, but to be able to actually get in any detail about how that FX will be impacting our business exactly, it's really difficult to do that, and not something at this time that I'd be comfortable with talking about. But it's something that we'll take a look at as we go forward and decide how much more color we can provide. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And is there \u2013 as you're considering that color at this point, is there a general rule of thumb that you've thought about, maybe even pre-Cordis in terms of when you see the exchange rate moving how much is naturally upset because of their location of operations? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : No, I wouldn't say there's a general rule of thumb because as one moves in one direction, often other ones could be moving in other directions so it's very difficult. Also as you can imagine with us just starting up with Cordis, we're just beginning to ramp up our hedging strategies and taking a look at all the things we can do in terms of hedging to be able to make sure that we have more consistent earnings. So it's just so early with the changes in the mix of our business, it's hard for me to be able to provide you a lot more detail than what I said, which is that right now, we see FX as a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, but other than that, I really can't give you more details. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : Thanks. We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Mike, I think you mentioned that to arrive at the high end of your guidance, generic manufacturing needs to be at the a certain level. Can you just give us more color on your assumption at kind of like the high end of guidance range around generic pricing? Do you assume that it's going to accelerate from current levels, stay the same? And also, at the low end of the guidance range, what are you receiving for generic inflation? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Ricky. I would tell you this. I think what we are trying to communicate there was that right now we're assuming that the moderation of generic pricing is steeper than we originally modeled at the beginning of the year. So generic pricing we expect to be a little bit more of a headwind in the second half than we had originally anticipated. Now as I've mentioned, there's other things going in the direction which is why we reaffirmed our overall guidance. But the two things that we think that would need to go back to more similar to the first half would be FX and generic pricing. If they were to return to more similar levels as where they were in the first part of this fiscal year, then that would enable us to get to the very high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And Ricky, it's George, as a reminder, and I know I do this probably every call, but it's really important. This is a huge number of products in this line, so it doesn't take \u2013 that's one of the challenges always in modeling is that it doesn't take that many products moving to alter the overall equation. But in the big sense, it tends to be driven by a small percentage of the overall total of products. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just one follow-up, just because there are a number of moving parts in the quarter. So can you quantify for us what same-store top line growth for distribution segment after you normalize for Metro and for Harvard and for the new outcome (24:08) business. And also on the EBIT line, just what we think about with (24:13) normalized growth for the distribution segment. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : That would be hard to do, Ricky. Clearly, Harvard, Cordis, Metro Medical are all providing revenue uplift for us but other than the fact that we said they are one of the components of our revenue and earnings growth, we still are just having really robust activities in growth with our existing and new customers, and to split that apart would be difficult and not something I think would be right for us to do right now. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, I would probably add, if you look at the revenue line, the contribution is not overwhelmingly coming from the forces (25:01), it's really our core business and our customers and new customers. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : Okay. We will take our next question from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, guys. It feels on the Medical side like we're trending kind of in a much better direction. And if you think about on sort of the base, (25:24) so let's put Cordis aside for a minute, it seems like the home piece is doing well. On the traditional base business, if you look at maybe ex what happened in Canada, where do you see the sort of key trends that are kind of moving in the right direction? And where do you feel like you've sort of met plan versus are there any areas in that piece where you actually feel like you've sort of exceeded plan? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, good morning, Ross. This is George. I'll take that and Mike, jump in. I think the underlying characteristics actually feel as good as they have in some time. I think partly the value proposition across our lines of business, Ross, helps us to sell the individual lines of business, because I think what \u2013 we're going to our customers who basically have very new kinds of strategic and financial needs with a line of products and services that I think touch those hot buttons. And I think increasingly, that just allows us to strengthen the position of each of the lines. So our underlying business feels like it's going pretty well. Of course, it's always competitive out there, but I think we've done a good job of articulating that value proposition. We've also done a good job, I think, Ross, in some of our legacy lines of improving efficiency and reducing cost where necessary, and I think that was also an important thing for us to do over this last year. So I think in general, we feel good progress along many of the lines in the Medical segment. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's helpful, George. And again, just sort of sticking on Ricky's theme, because I think the heart of what everyone's trying to figure out is, amongst the three players, each of you obviously have slightly different generic businesses and transact slightly differently. And so can you help us understand? It seems like Cardinal has sort of weathered the storm, at least relative to one of your peers better in terms of a change in the market and you've had a more balanced portfolio in generics. Could you just help us philosophically understand maybe some of the differences at least as you see it for Cardinal relative to the peers? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'll try to speak to Cardinal. It's really \u2013 it's tricky for me to try to speak for peer group and I shouldn't and probably won't. I think \u2013 what I would say is that as you guys look at peer groups \u2013 again, we have many different competitors in different lines of business, and I always have to remind you of that, but I think every business is different. Everybody's product line is different, their product mixes are different, and their customer mixes are different. So from our standpoint, we've devoted a lot of energy over these last seven years to positioning ourselves both in terms of product line and in terms of customer mix to be on what we think are the right side of trends. And so again, this is not for me a comment on anybody else, but on our business. I think our teams have done a good job of segmenting our markets, understanding what their needs are and how we can attach value from our work to theirs. It's been a long process, but I think we're generally doing that fairly effectively. So it's a hard question to answer as a comparative answer, but I think I can describe our organization, which is very much focused on certain key trends and we have been for quite some time, and then really disciplined execution around priorities that tie to those. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and I would just add that I think that we've been really focused on the day-to-day blocking and tackling, as well as the strategic priorities that we're on. So when it comes to things like focused on our SG&A to really making sure that we're investing in the right places and controlling that, staying insanely focused on the customer to deliver value to them and listening to what they need, I really like what both the M and the P teams are doing there, and then you take a look at the acquisition on \u2013 the acquisitions in how we're performing on those has been excellent, and then overall, just execution against our strategic priorities. So all those things also, I think, are helping contribute to our success. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : And as a reminder, please allow yourself one question and one follow-up question. And we will now take our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions here. George, I know you mentioned earlier about your physician preference item strategy here and the shift to value-based care. Can you talk about, though, where your customers are at in this progress? I mean, if you look at sort of targets from CMS and, et cetera, it looks like there's aggressive targets out there, but hospitals might be moving at a little bit of slower pace here. Can you talk about how they are viewing it and how that fits into your strategy, and we could maybe see an acceleration and driving into your numbers? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I'll try. Good morning, Charles. This is a process. Obviously we have an enormous healthcare system that's been operating with a certain financing model for many, many years. So change doesn't happen overnight and we don't expect it to. So I think what's going to happen is we're \u2013 it's a process, we'll be living in a world in which both the fee-for-service model exists and alternate models are emerging. And I think again you can look around the country indifferent health systems and they're all responding differently. There are, of course, pressures from, as you said, the public and the private sector to move to some new financing levels models, which focus more on outcomes than activity. And I think everybody is at a different stage of adapting to that. What we've tried to do is make sure we're in a position to compete in either model. In a fee-for-service model, we know how to do that, and I think, as Mike said, we're very disciplined about that, but we've started to build some tools that allow us to be a valued partner in models that are emerging. So I think as you're describing it's a mixed bag around the system but the pressure is to move towards some kind of value based exists and that's probably true here, and it's probably true elsewhere in the world as well. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Can you talk about M&A opportunities then as you keep trying to build out your capabilities here, how do you see the landscape understand you capabilities to attack on it? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that for us this is very hard to comment on. I would say this, as Mike highlighted in his commentary, we're got great financial capability, but for us it's always a question of strategic positioning, whether or not we see opportunities to enhance the capabilities, the scale, the efficiency of some operation we do or some market that ties onto some value that's really connected to a customer need. We'll continue to be op been minded about that as we have been. I don't think our view has changed as it relates to the overall balance of our capital deployment. We will look at that is one of the tools, and we'll continue to look if the opportunities are right. But we have the financial flexibility to do that and I think organizational capacity. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I agree. Our capital deployment policy hasn't changed. We still believe that CapEx is obviously number one on our list and then continuing with our differentiated dividend, and then we're going to look opportunistically at both M&A and share repurchases. And as George said, we're going to stay balanced and disciplined on that. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. George, just really want to follow-up, or Mike, want to follow up on thoughts around the Medical segment. Mike, I think you made a comment that Cardinal Health products grew again this quarter. Can you give us an idea of what you've seen from a growth rate perspective? And then secondly, I think you have this roll-out in the marketplace around where you can get the margin on the Medical segment over time. If I back out the one-time item around inventory, a step-up in the quarter, it looks like the margins are trending just above 4%. So can you talk to us about how do you reach that goal of above 5% over the next couple of years? Is that the private label product? What are the things that we need to see in that segment, and do you feel like you're on target for reaching that goal? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let me start with first a couple things. I think first of all, our Cardinal Health brand product, even if you pulled out Cordis still we're able to grow. And so we were excited about the execution of the team being able to sell those products. So important to note even without Cordis, the Cardinal Health brand products did grow. As you know, there's many margin initiatives in Medical that we can get to go after getting to our aspiration of 5.75%. And as you know that by definition, an aspiration means it's something you can think you can achieve, but it's hard-to-reach and it's something that you've got to get out and execute and get a lot of things done to do and we're not backing away from that aspiration. But it's not only growing the Cordis product, it's the other Cardinal Health brand, it's growing the at-Home business, which also had a nice revenue growth this quarter. It's also our services business, which tend to be higher margin rates. And we've always said all along that to get to that rate there would probably be additional M&A to get there. And so we're going to continue to evaluate in a very disciplined way other M&A opportunities to reach that goal. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If we think about the comments that you made, additional M&A around tip to recycle, but do you feel like operationally you're where you wanted to be as we think about the margin today? Or do you see more enhancements that you need to do in your core business outside of acquisitions? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : (35:26). Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I don't think whether it's Don or John or George or I or any of us are ever operationally where we want to be. We're always striving to get better. I mean, that's what I think makes us as successful as we have been lately is that we're always focused on getting better. But I do like where we're at on the Medical side as far as how they're executing on all those things I mentioned earlier like services, like the current products businesses, launching new products ourselves on our more commodity like lines, as well as driving our higher physician preference items. So I don't know. George, do you have anything else? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think that's right. We're going to be \u2013 I think one of the things that you hopefully will see for us as we have tried to adapt quickly where we need to, so for example, we talked about the legacy business on the Med-Surg (36:15) side, we had to make some moves, I think, really to tighten the reins there in certain parts of it, manage the expenses differently, but also manage the mix differently. And I think a lot of this is about that kind of discipline to manage both of the expense side, but certainly of the mix of products. I think that's an effective and important tool and we can still get better. Operator : We will take our next question from George R. Hill from Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Mike, I wanted to follow up on Ross's question little bit. When we think about generic inflation, I guess, can you qualitatively talk about the buckets? Will you guys monetize either the inflation or the deflation, the buy side margin, the sell side margin, the carry margin? And how should we think about the importance of each of the buckets or the sizes of each of the buckets? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit of information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both an inflationary environment on generics or a deflationary environment. Historically, generics has been a deflationary environment and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it in two ways. Think about it this way : when generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory reevaluation income or some people call that buy side-margins. And so, in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get floor stock adjusted. So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on the \u2013 the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation, but in both environments, you're able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember whether you're in an inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is based often \u2013 it's not often \u2013 is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the products and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every single day. And so that's really important to us. There's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers. Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces to go together and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try and quantify those when it's all blended together. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Then maybe a quick follow-up on one of the other levers is. You hear a lot of also small and mid-sized brand drug manufacturers complaining about the fees that they pay to the wholesalers to access the channel. I know that brand drugs are the portion of the margin, as a portion of the total segment margin are a smaller piece. But how should we think about how important those fees from the smaller and mid-sized branded guys are, and what's to the risk to that segment of the business if they're consolidated away? And I'll hop off. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think all of our manufacturer partners are important to us. We work really, really hard to make sure no matter what size you are, whether you're in Medical or in Pharma, that you're seen as important. I think that's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of also is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner. But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we're very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees and we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs, all those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so, we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us. And so, I feel really confident with our model and our pricing that we're the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any more country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States. And I think the other piece is \u2013 I can't even remember the last time there's been any other significant slot supply chain integrity issue in the U.S., and so that to me is incredibly important. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : George, I'd like to follow up again just having had some experience outside the U.S. The supply chain for pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the most efficient, has the highest line item fill rates, is the safest, and is the most secure the world. So I think that this is something that is important to our partners. We actually generally hear very positive things from them about that work, and that's important in terms of our value proposition. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Operator, next question. Operator : We will take our next question from Dave Francis from RBC Capital Markets. Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys, and sorry to keep going back to the pricing well, but given the focus everybody's had on it of late, I had a couple more questions. First, from your seat, George and Mike, how are you seeing your end customers in the marketplace, whether it be health systems or PBMs or retailers, how are they reacting either strategically or operationally to the changing price dynamic in both the brand and generic baskets? And how is that affecting your business particularly? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Dave. It's a hard question to answer because it really depends what seat you're in. I do think that, as Mike described, all of our customers are influenced by the reimbursement dynamics, how they are compensated, and that companies are from the private sector or the public sector. I think what can be worrisome to them is when there's lags between how they get compensated in reimbursement or how they're \u2013 not just time lags, but lags in general between what their costs look like and what their reimbursement looks like. So we just try to stay very close to it. It can vary by product and it can vary by different classes of drugs. But I do think it's an environment, which is, as you guys have all said, a lot of attention on this. We try to stay very close to it. I think we pride ourselves on having a certain intimacy with our customers and understanding where they are. So we try to make sure that we do everything that we can to put them in a position to be successful in serving their patients. But certainly, a lot of it has to do with reimbursement dynamics and what's happening around financing models in the system. Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I think also, Dave, just so you know, I think while cost and reimbursement are obviously incredibly critical to our customers, there's a lot of other services that we provide that are helpful to them. Helping them take capital out by helping them manage their inventory, helping giving them a broader array of private label products or physician preference products or helping them with various types of programs to run their business are also critical. And so we try hard to find more than \u2013 while we focus incredibly hard every day on getting, being \u2013 have the best cost to provide great pricing, there's a lot of other pieces that are critical. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Just to add one piece to that, one of the things that we find is that the absence of standardization around healthcare is often a source of inefficiency. And so one of the things that we've been able to help many of our customers do is standardize, for example, around consumable products. So when they do that, that tends to be much more cost effective, and so that's one of the tools that we use. Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And as a quick follow-up, just to put a fine point on it, understanding there are a lot moving pieces in it, but would you characterize the overall generic basket today as still being moderately inflationary? Or have you seen it gone deflationary? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : It's clearly moderated significantly, so I would say it's very close to right almost a wash in between right now what we're seeing right now. So it's hard to say whether it's slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary, depending on the day of the week and where you are. But it has clearly moderated steeper than we had said. But again, while it's moderated more than we expected it to, we're doing really well overall in our overall generics program and like (44:50) the other components that are delivering valuable. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Dave, as a reminder, because you described the overall basket, again just as a reminder, the overwhelming majority of products are moving the way they typically move. And then what tends to swing the total or the net aggregate is just a relatively small basket of products. And so I think that's probably worth noting all the time that you have thousands of products that are moving fairly typically. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, operator. Operator : Okay. We will now take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about the Pharma operating margin itself? I mean it looks like revenue was good in the quarter, but according to our model, it looks like an 18 basis point contraction year-over-year and a slight decline in operating profit itself on a sequential basis. Just \u2013 I mean any more color around that? I mean is that new customer starts or is it all generic inflation or have you changed the way that you're pricing new business, sort of what Dave Francis was asking about? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No real fundamental changes to the way we're pricing or the competitive environment or anything like that. This is merely, the 18 basis points is really, the majority of it is the addition of a new customer that was added in the quarter that was at lower margin rates. And remember, we talked about this and that this is a situation, while the margin rates are lower, the amount of capital that we deploy is incredibly efficient. And so we're willing to take lower margin rates when we have the ability to manage our capital effectively. As far as the sequential drop, remember last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like one-timers, part of it being those generic items that were operating a little bit differently than we anticipated. And then also, we had the acceleration of some of the benefits of our M&A in the quarter that was a little bit better than we thought. So, if you think about $0.11 of kind of extra in last quarter, the reason we talked about that then, it was to give you some insight that, that was kind of a way to think about how this quarter would be. So this was very much in line with what we expected for this quarter. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. And then you made some comments I think on the Cardinal home health business growing I think double-digits year-over-year. Is that the top line organic growth rate, the home health business growing over 10% per year on the top line? Is that correct? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that's top line. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question. Operator : Okay. We will now take our next question from Garen Sarafian from Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone. On branded pharma contracts and inflation, Mike, you had mentioned last quarter that you try to proactively manage those agreements and I'm assuming you had at least some contracts that were up for renewal at calendar year end. So could you elaborate a bit on how those conversations have changed in any way even if I think you mentioned that they were broadly in line in the prepared remarks? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Garen. I wouldn't say anything's different. I'm not getting a different sense from the manufacturers. There's always a good negotiation every time one of these happen. Everybody wants to pay lower. We want to get paid more. We spend a lot of time talking about the various dynamics of the manufacturers' mix and whether their line extension's gone up or down, whether or not they've changed their mix as far as controlled drugs or refrigerated items. And so we work through all those. We have incredibly productive relationships with our manufacturers. And so I would tell you that the way these are going, still trending the way they have historically and they're still about 80% or so of the margins are coming from a non-contingent standpoint and roughly 20% or so are coming from what we call a contingent basis, which means that inflation can drive the actual value of the dollars when we talk about contingent versus non-contingent. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Great. And then, apologies if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but on you having raised the high end of sales guidance, did you mention which segments or specific businesses you're seeing evolve more favorably? Thanks a lot. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Our revenue overall was an overall revenue guidance increase. But as you can see, obviously, the Pharma segment has performed well but with the addition of Cordis and some other good activities. Medical also had a good top line growth, so but that was an overall to go from mid-teens to mid- to high-teens. Operator : Okay. We will now take our next question from John Kreger from William Blair. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Robbie Fada (49:55) in for John today. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning Unknown Speaker : Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier in the call that there were a few things on the generic side that are offsetting the inflation rate moderation. Can you flesh that out a little bit, perhaps give us a sense of what percent of customers are currently still buying direct versus how many have shifted to buying through the channel? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I won't be able to do that. I know that's a question but go ahead, George, do you want to comment or? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Why don't you take the first part which is the moving parts? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Yeah. From a movings parts standpoint, I would tell you that the two things that we said would moderate the shares, as we've talked about a couple times, was generic inflation, and as I've mentioned, it's moderated a little bit more than we had modeled. We expect generic launches for this year to be slightly less than this past year. But in terms of overall, our ability to source products is doing better. Our ability to penetrate existing and new customers is going very well. Our use of data and analytics and how we price our products is going really well. So, when you wrap it all together, I still feel like our overall generics program is performing about as we expected. But they're \u2013 it's just coming in a little bit differently. Other than that, I really can't split it down more. It's actually \u2013 even if I wanted to, it's incredibly difficult because they're all so interrelated on how we work with customers. It's very difficult to split it apart. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Robbie (51:20), I'll try to touch base \u2013 I'll try to touch on one part of your question, which was those customers that source generics from us. I think if you look at our numbers, it's pretty clear that, that has increased for us. I do think the market recognizes that, particularly given the strength of our capacity in working through Red Oak, that we're a very attractive partner. And so I think there are many customers in the system that actually have done for years a blend of buying generics, some directly, some through distribution partners. And so even small swings in those percentages can be beneficial to us. We think our value proposition is very strong, as Mike said, and getting increasingly strong. So we're hoping that we can continue to attract those customers. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks very much. And one quick one on Medical, if I could. Is there any update on what kind of commodity-related tailwind you might see in the coming quarters if oil remains low? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, remember, too, the oil price that you see every day is more of a spot market versus more of the forward curves. But at the beginning of the year, we had mentioned that we thought commodities would be a $10 million to $20 million good guy for us this year and that's still tracking essentially as we said it would at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing to remember is that we've employed a lot of \u2013 a host of hedging strategies. We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers as well as, if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about six months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is, is that we have a lot of different commodities and not all move with oil. And so, where probably five years to ten years ago, oil was a much better proxy for how our commodities will go. It's very different today when you look at our mix of commodities that we buy. Many of them do not move in correlation with oil at all. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette from UBS. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Steven (53:42). Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : So I guess just for me, one question that we keep getting from investors, this kind of relates to Red Oak a little bit, but without going into specific details, investors keep wondering is there anything maybe mechanical about Red Oak that perhaps smoothes out your generic profits where perhaps Cardinal made a little bit less profit during the big generic hyperinflation quarter but maybe it shields you a little bit on the way down on generic pricing? Or if there is a better smoothing of generics profits for Cardinal versus peers, as some investors perceive, does it maybe have nothing to do with Red Oak in your view? Just curious if you want to offer any additional color on that. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think it's maybe \u2013 it's a little bit Red Oak, but really, this was really pre-Red Oak, was that probably about four years or so ago when we were reevaluating our overall way we buy generics. We made a very conscious decision that we would cut back on our spec buying and the way we managed inventory with generics. And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers and we thought over the long run it would improve our relationships and hopefully make them stickier as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us. And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak is that our focus is, at Red Oak is how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers? Obviously, we want get a great price, but we want to be transparent. We want to be easy to do business with. We want them to want to come do business with us, and one of that way is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that I think maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to declines in pricing. Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So maybe just a little bit less forward buying versus your peers that again doesn't necessarily have to do with Red Oak, but to the forward buying? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : It's hard for me to say what my peers were doing. I won't comment on what they were doing. But I can just tell you that for us, managing inventory more around being a great partner and making it efficient in the supply chain was the focus for us versus other types of activities. Thanks, Steve. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : Okay. We will take our final question from Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks very much. Good morning. First question is around Pharma, very strong growth in the quarter couple of billion of upside versus Street, seems like that was probably your net wins driven. But can you give us a sense on the M&A impact in Pharma in terms of percentage points of growth and also maybe your best estimate of what your same-store trend might be excluding net wins and losses? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I would tell you that the majority of our growth was growth from our relationships with new and existing customers. Acquisitions were a smaller contributor of our overall growth but that's the best I can give you in terms of trying to size the two. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Eric, just a reminder, we have tens of thousands of customers. And so, again, small movements in those customers can be meaningful. And of course, as you know in the branded side, over the last \u2013 you've seen a lot being driven by some of the important new products in the system. And so we shouldn't ignore that as well. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, that's fair. Just a quick follow-up on \u2013 we didn't hear much about the Henry Schein relationship and I'm just curious if you can give us a sense if that was a driver of your Cardinal brand growth in the quarter and how that's tracking to-date? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, again, plays with the relationship, I wouldn't say economically yet a big driver, but definitely positive to be able to sell many of our Cardinal brand products through these additional channels. So we really look forward to greater growth there and it's \u2013 again, it's early, but it's off to a pretty good start. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, is anybody else in queue? Operator : No, there is not. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : George? Operator : And I will turn the call over to George Barrett for closing. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thank you, Bethany. Again, just closing summary, I think we're off to a really good start to the first half of our fiscal 2016. We thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your questions and look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. And with that, we'll close the call. Thank you. Operator : And at this time this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our third quarter call. We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers. First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year, to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And, third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $5.17 to $5.27. The mid-point of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year. I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines. Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment. First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from Pharmaceutical distribution and specialty. Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continue to quickly respond to our customers' needs and strengthen our relationship through our value-added service offerings and, as a result, have out-paced the market in all classes of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction. As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall healthcare system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. With demographics driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments and, in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our system's ability to contain costs through competition and provide the needed headspace to help fund pharmaceutical innovation. We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment which I'd like to highlight and which have some financial implications for the near term. First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging Baby Boomers are putting on the healthcare system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come. Second, the cycle of patent expirations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of in-market (4:10) brand drugs. Right now we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters and we would expect this pattern to continue into our FY 2017, with the value from new launches being down from FY 2016. As you know, this can change based on patent cases and we will provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finish our FY 2016 and guide for FY 2017. Third, the flow of new ANDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly ANDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of ANDAs approved just in the six-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle discourse around the cost and value of pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio in the aggregate we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturer inflation rate in the near future. Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we would expect to settle out as the coming months unfold. Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics would be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well-positioned, well-prepared and we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing on the capabilities of our sourcing through Red Oak. Turning to our Specialty Solutions group. We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and we're expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as the flow of new innovative pharmaceuticals emerges from BioPharma pipelines. Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment, we are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our Nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostic space and, at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic radiobiopharmaceuticals. Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment. Turning to our Medical segment. Our Medical segment put up some strong numbers in the period. We continued to deliver the tools, services and technologies that thousands of care providers depend on every day. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year, to $3.1 billion and segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step-up, which Mike will cover. Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contribution from existing lines of business which continue to get stronger. We continue to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us. In the period, we saw growth in Cardinal Health consumables, services to hospitals and health systems, surgical kits, lab products and Cardinal Health at Home. Don and his team are driving strong performance and we're very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been thoughtfully crafted and is being effectively executed. For example, we have identified the activities and process of discharge into the post-acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall healthcare system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and Curaspan, which strengthen our ability to play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment models. Finally on Medical, the integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and AccessClosure U.S. commercial teams, we have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new President in Japan and a new Operations Leader to our Cordis headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together. And care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits. We do have some important work in front of us, though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call that the Day 2 (8:52) countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU and would like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio. Let me close with an important point. At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the healthcare landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but poised to lead. We've worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers' most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer groupings and markets and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George. And thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance, then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Starting with consolidated company results, third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later. Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior-year quarter. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and, as of the end of the quarter, had slightly under $400 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million. And at the end of the third quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment. Moving on to segment performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Segment profit was $660 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. There were two primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in Pharmaceutical distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both Specialty and Nuclear were contributors, with Specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016. Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mix dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive effect to margin rates, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint. In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions net of divestitures as well as growth from all of our existing businesses. Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter. Let me give you a little more color on Cordis. First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 (15:06) countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses that could result in variability between quarters. As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these cause margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know. But, again, overall Cordis is performing well. Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private-label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion. Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand products growth was in the low-double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter. Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the quarter. Turning to slide number six, you'll see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost. Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint. Looking sequentially to Q4, four things essentially explain the variance from Q3. First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by Albertsons, we stopped servicing them as of April 1 which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final two are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items. For our full-year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter I mentioned that foreign exchange and a generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary. Moving on to slide nine of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016. First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we've lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also, we expect that our full-year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share. Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY 2017. We still have work to do on sizing each of these. So my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative. Starting with the Medical segment, we expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY 2017 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing our national brand to be a headwind. Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until we anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Under our generics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and the shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY 2017 to be less than FY 2016. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY 2017. As I mentioned in our Q4 FY 2015 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plans, FY 2017 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY 2016. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success. Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the Specialty business. As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY 2017 outlook and will provide additional clarity on our Q4 fiscal 2016 call in August. Let me close by expressing my appreciation to our people who delivered a record quarter in Q3, who continue to do things necessary to position us on the right side of healthcare trends and who I know will work tirelessly and with discipline to achieve our goals and, of course, serve our customers and their patients. Operator, let's go to the questions. Operator : Thank you. We've got Robert Jones or Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. George and Mike, I appreciate all the details you guys shared around generics and then some of the changes from 3Q to 4Q, but I guess I'm still trying to parse out what was incremental relative to what you had line-of-sight into previously. If I just look at the implied 4Q guidance you guys highlighted, having a hard time based off the trends in both segments seeing how growth will slow as much as you're implying. So I guess really just if you could go back to some of the buckets you highlighted, what moved against you from where you were thinking about the year previously to how you're thinking about the fourth quarter now? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, thanks for the questions, Bob. I appreciate it. I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece. That is what we're seeing sequentially. Both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4. So that's number one. Second of all, the Safeway contract expired and we quit servicing the business on April 1. So we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the two biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impact sequentially on it and then also there's just some corporate items, several smaller corporate items, that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter and so that maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it. And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range, we really needed to see FX rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't see really much change at all in FX and so we're not seeing any pick-up from that in the fourth quarter. And in generic inflation, in the fourth quarter we're expecting it to be more like what we saw in the last part of Q3, which, as you know as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So just to be clear then, Mike, the generic pricing didn't change from what you had thought, it just didn't come back in your favor. Is that a fair characterization? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I would say it didn't change from the second half of Q3, but what we're expecting is the whole Q4 to be more like the end of Q3. So, yeah, I wouldn't say it really changed from what we were trying to help you through, to get to that top end of the range, we needed it to be go back the other way. But it did change from Q2. And then, as I said, we're expecting it to be more similar to the second half of Q3 than it was for the whole Q3. Operator : We'll go next to George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Mike and George. And thanks for taking the questions. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess, George, could you provide a little more color on this industry realignment that you mentioned? I don't know if you can get any more granular on what you're seeing and the impact it's having on the business. And then as it relates to the changes in generic drug price inflation versus deflation, as we look into 2017, is the expectation that inflation will be less than it was in 2016, or are we back to a more normalized modestly deflationary environment? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, George, good morning. Let me start with the second part in a sense, because as I described in the call, there are really sort of a number of factors at work here, including the launch cycle, the rate of approvals, which creates more products in the system, reimbursement dynamics which our customers feel. So this is all part of the dynamic that affect the overall pricing environment. So that's what I was trying to capture, which is that this is really not a single factor, but we're seeing a number of factors that actually come together. As it relates to realignment, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omnicare, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and Rite Aid. And so I think those kinds of big moves have a tendency to create a little bit of short-term disturbance and then they just settle out. And I just wanted to highlight that. But I think what we're describing here is more, again, as Mike said, it is quite different than it was at the early part of the year, of our fiscal 2016. And that's what we're describing. So what we've tried to do with you, George, is to always be transparent about the environment that we're seeing. And this is as clear as we can be about the way we see the environment today. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : And to answer your question, George, about 2017. Mike, do you want to... Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. On 2017, George, we are expecting generic inflation to be less in 2017 versus 2016. But, again, it's early and that can change. There's so many factors, as you know, George. I think described several of those that can impact it, but we're looking at it more as what we're seeing in the second part of Q3 and what we're assuming for Q4. If that stays consistent, we would expect 2017 to have less generic inflation than FY 2016. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, Mike, maybe just a real quick follow-up. Can you give us any sense for what OP margins in the core drug business were like in the quarter ex-Optum, ex the acquisitions? And I'm trying to get sense, would we have seen the changes in the deflationary environment in the quarter ex the bigger moving pieces? And the margin deterioration rate that we're seeing in Q4, is that how we should be thinking about the business in what I'll call the near to medium-term? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Gosh, a lot of moving parts on that. I can tell you again, the biggest driver is really the mix dynamic with the addition of the large customer. You also have to remember in Q3, it's our biggest branded inflation quarter, so that obviously has some impact on the quarter. And then you have the acquisitions rolling in and synergies. There's just so many moving parts, it would be hard for me to break those apart, but I think hopefully that's at least enough color to give you a little bit of help. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. It's Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross this morning. I have a question in terms of \u2013 you obviously had some pretty impressive cash flow generation in the quarter. Have you guys changed any of your thoughts regarding capital allocation and, as a follow-up, how you're seeing valuations in the market generally? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I can take it and George can add a little, too. Right now, there would be no change in our capital deployment policy. We're still going to be focused on investing in the business, first, through our capital expenditures and then we're going to stay focused on our differentiated dividend. And as we've said before, we're going to continue to balance between M&A and stock buybacks. We did do some stock buyback this quarter. As I mentioned, we did $300 million worth of it in this quarter. So we do look at that all the time to see what's the right use our cash and we will continue to do that going forward. As far as the environment from M&A, I can see George wants to make a couple comments. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Just generally, I think our team did a really good job of managing working capital. And so we're very conscious of \u2013 certainly we don't want it to sit still. If we're accumulating cash we will be very, very smart and balanced I think about how we deploy that. As it relates to valuations out there, the primary driver for us, as you know, when we look at anything related to an acquisition is the strategic fit and how relevant that is to the changes in front of us in healthcare and whether Cardinal can be an advantaged owner of any given asset. And so we think a lot about those execution things. Obviously, valuation when it's coming back to a better place, certainly makes those transactions can make them more attractive. But at the driver is always going to be that strategy piece and how we, as Cardinal, can create value from it. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC : That makes a lot of sense. And then just as a follow-up, I was just wondering in terms of you mentioned that obviously Red Oak was a contributor in the quarter. Have you seen any change in outlook in terms of how it's been helping you guys or any change in the way you're working with that structure? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I was just at the board meeting in the last week and continue to be incredibly excited about the talent at Red Oak. It's just a fantastic team. Our relationship with CVS continues to be both strategic and positive to work together on opportunities with Red Oak, not only today but going forward. Clearly, we'll be lapping some of the initial opportunities that we saw in Red Oak. When you go from nothing to starting up and executing as quickly as we did, we had some large incremental upticks over the first couple of quarters. And that would be coming down a little bit. But as far as it continuing to be a benefit for us, we continue to see Red Oak to be a positive driver for us going forward in the future and we continue to be excited about it. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I'd just add we continue to talk to a lot of our manufacturer partners and I think they really appreciate the simplicity of the way that we created that model and they know what to expect and how to work with us. And so the team there and Mike and the board at Red Oak have done a great job. Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC : Perfect. Thank you so much. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Welcome. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions here. The first one, George, if we step back, right, and we think about the generic pipelines, the generic inflation environment and the industry dynamics, how should we think about the long-term growth for the distribution segment in a normalized environment? So beyond fiscal year 2017 in the nuance of contract gains and losses, but just when we think about the core industry drivers. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, good morning, Ricky. At this point, obviously we're not going to be guiding long-term forecast for our business unit. But let me just give some color to the Pharmaceutical Distribution business. We are incredibly well positioned. I'm not sure that I've ever felt that we're better positioned, certainly through my tenure here, in terms of the way that we're creating value for customers, the strength of those relationships, the opportunities in front of us to continue to use the value creation that has occurred through I think the strength and capability of Red Oak on generics. Demographics are certainly a positive for us. So I think our long-term view is quite positive. We are going always have these dips related to activities in the market or pricing dynamics or launches. But fundamentally, I think this business is really robust, we're extremely well-positioned and we feel very optimistic over the long-term of about its growth prospects. And I think you've seen over this last couple of years that our positioning has improved quite substantially. Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, obviously, we heard that you won the Kaiser contract on the Med Device segment. So congrats on that. Can you maybe share with us what you think differentiated your offering versus the incumbent, what's included in that contract, if any of the new businesses that you've acquired are in it? And also, there's still a decision pending on the drug purchasing contract. How do you think about this opportunity? And are there any read-throughs between the two, or are these completely separate decisions? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Thanks for the question, Ricky. Yeah, look, we did confirm that we were awarded the Med-Surg supply for Kaiser. We do expect that probably to transition over the coming quarters. I do think it was really about the broad capabilities of Cardinal to create value in a market going through a change. I think, again, it's not fair for me to speak for Kaiser, but I think the general dialogue was really about the future, about the evolution of their business, how they're going to have to serve a customer base that continues to be treated in different care settings and our ability to take care of that as well as the services and technologies that we may be able to bring to them that improve efficiencies in their operations. So I think increasingly that discussion is occurring with our largest customers. They understand that complexity is increasing and that those partners that can help them navigate that are probably more attractive as they go forward. And I think that was a differentiator for us. Again, being careful not to speak for them. There are other lines of business, obviously, that we serve to the market and Kaiser is looking at those. I could not comment on the status of any of those. It's not appropriate. I will say that we're well positioned with Kaiser or anyone else on other lines of business, whether or not that's a surgical kitting or service to the home or pharmaceutical distribution. So as I said earlier, I think I really like our positioning, but I don't think I can comment specifically on Kaiser and those lines of business and how that's going to unfold. Operator : We'll go next to Bob Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Unknown Speaker : Penny Willoughby (37:05) in for Bob. It doesn't look like Cordis has any impact on your working capital balances. Should we be expecting any shifts in future quarters, for better or worse? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So I think that is Bob's daughter, Penny (37:19). It is Bring Your Child to Work Day. We have hundreds of kids buzzing around the halls here. So good morning. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, do you want to take this? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure that Bob has a smile on his face like we do here when we walk in in the morning being able to do that. Penny (37:36), I would say that right now I don't that the Cordis acquisition will have a huge capital change in either our capital deployment policy or in our cash flows or anything going forward. I still feel really good that with all the other moving pieces we have in our businesses, we're always focused on managing our capital as tightly as possible, making the right investments at the right time, whether it be with our supplier partners, our customers or in M&A or stock repo. So I don't think it's going to have any material change going forward. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Penny (38:12), for the questions. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you for the questions. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher of Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I'm still trying to wrap my head around sequential trend. And if I understand you right, it sounds like on the Pharmaceutical side, you're seeing normal seasonality and then Safeway, so it sounds like we could use Q4 as a proxy moving forward. So I ask that first. And then the second half would be in Medical at the segment level, obviously a very strong quarter. You won't have the $21 million headwind next quarter. But you mentioned that there's going to be some timing issues over the next couple of quarters. So I guess, first, can I confirm that around the Pharma side and then your thoughts on Medical? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so from Pharma, yeah, the first two big items I talked about were more majority Pharma. But, again, part of the branded inflation, when I talked about part of that also in Medical. Medical also sees a slightly better Q3 than Q4 from a price increase activity. But clearly you're absolutely right, the largest piece of that branded inflation component happens in Pharma Distribution. And sequentially Q4 is always a much smaller quarter than Q3. And then the Safeway piece is the other piece. So, yes, on Pharma, that would be it. As far as Medical goes, yeah, that's what I was trying to get a little color. As we're bringing on Cordis, again, some of the things I mentioned. And we've got several different types of transition service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off of those and how we can work through those. We have different Day 2 (40:00) countries coming in on different timing and then we have certain expenses where we're ramping up on new head count and then also getting after the synergies and taking expenses out in other areas. So all of those things create some variability between quarters. And so, again, those Cordis results may not quite be as linear as you would expect them to be for a few more quarters until things normalize for us. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Are there dollars flowing out today for the transition services that will dissipate and then at the same time you may have higher upfront costs to stand up, the same (40:32)? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, I think that's a really good way to look at it because we're incurring costs to stand those up, then they transition out. And then net-net, we expect all of that to be a positive force. As we mentioned, in FY 2018, as we exit FY 2018, we expect to be at $100 million of synergies on Cordis. So we're still expecting that as we exit FY 2018. But there'll be a lot of noise as we're standing up, at the same time we're still on and then we roll-off those transition services agreements into what we think are going to be better cost situations for us. But, again, I think it's really important to know that the underlying Cordis business is doing really well, done an excellent job of staffing up, both from management and the sales teams. Operator : We'll go next to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. So, Mike, when you talked about 2017, and I know that, at this point, it's qualitative. But you are highlighting Medical versus drug. And if you look at the results in this quarter, and I know the previous question asked about next quarter and how do we think about it going forward, but can we talk about some of the underlying drivers in more specifics to this quarter and how to think about them going forward? And my first question would be around private label, the Cardinal products. Can you give us any indication as to what percentage of the sales that was? Does your new contract, for example, include private label for companies like Kaiser? And how do we think about the growth component of that as we start to think about 2017 and beyond? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I can't specifically get into what the product mix will be with Kaiser. But as you can imagine, with any customer we have, we're constantly looking to be able to shift them to our products, both to save them money and improve our margins and work together positively. So that's the goal with every single customer we have. As far as some of the other private label products and the percentage, I will tell you that it is going up significantly. But we plan to give a more detailed update at our Dublin Day in June, when Don is going to spend some time walking through how all of those mechanics are working and how things are going. But suffice it to say we're seeing some nice improvement, both as a percentage of revenue as well as a percentage of margins on our products. So that's a real positive. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me add to that, Lisa, just to give some color. In the last two years, we've probably added 2,000 SKUs to that line. So this has been a very focused effort to expand that line, which we think really creates value for our customers and for us. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And, George, I think historically at your last Analyst Day, you talked about a goal of 5.75% as a margin for the Medical segment. Do you feel that you can get there with the assets that you have today and private label? Or do you think you need to make incremental acquisitions to add to the offering to ultimately get to that goal? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I don't think anything has changed from the last meeting that when we talked about this before, again, it's an aspiration, which means it's something that is not simple, it's not a lay-up to get to. But when we really take a look at what we have on tap, both internally with our organic growth with Cordis, with our growth in our distribution services business, with our new post-acute business acquisitions, At Home growing faster than we expected, et cetera, we expect to see very good performance against that goal organically. But we also have said we would expect to get there we would need to do some more M&A. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : We'll go next to Dave Francis of RBC Capital Markets. Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning. Again, a couple of different items that you've already covered, but quickly on the generic pricing front. George and Mike, are you guys in a position, given your look at the broad portfolio of products, to see on the uptick of ANDA approvals at FDA, if there is a targeting effort going on by FDA to look at some of the lower competition, higher-priced pockets of the market to potentially create additional competition and, therefore, lower pricing in the market? Or is this something that you guys just don't have a good window into right now trying to figure out directionally where the market's going? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Dave, that's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to it. I'll give you some historical perspective, but I cannot tell you about the inner workings and how they're seeing this. Historically, the FDA has been very conscious of getting first drug to market and always took priority to make sure that they could do that to encourage competition. Whether or not they're targeting specific drugs is really hard to say. I don't think we would have line of sight on that. You know that they've expressed publicly and to Congress that they're really working hard to dig out of the backlog. What is probably worth also nothing is the inflow into to them continues to be very high, but the outflow has increased but the incoming number of applications continues to be really robust. But I don't think we have enough line of sight or insights into their thinking to know that they're targeting particular drugs. Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-up, shifting back to the Kaiser win. As you look more broadly at the marketplace, you've seen other leading health systems out there identifying the physician preference item issue from a cost perspective. Where would you say the market is relative to recognizing some of the overall trends that you guys are trying to get after relative to the changing reimbursement environment and how that might play out for you over the intermediate to long-term? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is essentially part of the work we do in our segmentation. There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiency through standardization. And there are others that are just at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems. And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you will, for example than on the physician preference side and where you want it, it requires a little bit more buy-in in the system. So I think you'd have to look at those a little bit differently from the commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference area. So, again, it varies a little bit by product type and it certainly varies a lot by system. Overall directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. That's probably good news for us. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator? Operator : We'll go next to Garen Sarafian of Citi. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, George and Mike. So I just wanted to go back to your generics commentary. So for a bit of clarification, but more a clarification at this point. You mentioned flat to slightly deflationary environment. But previously you've stated you're protected to the down side. So you'd be protected to the extent it becomes deflationary, is that the right way to think about it? And maybe related to the generics again. If there's any way you could help us think through qualitatively the size of the generic contribution step-down in fiscal 2017 in either moderating inflation or in new introductions, that would be helpful. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, let me take a couple of comments and if I miss something, please feel free in the follow-up. But I think first of all, yes, when it comes to inventory, we are price protected on inventory. And so I don't have any concerns that as we see deflation on any generic inventory or any item that we have any generic inventory risk. So let's just take that one off the table first. That one's not a concern. As far as we what think the rate of deflation will be, obviously, that's a tough one. But there is a lot of market commentary out there around it. And from what we're hearing if you listen to some of the various manufacturers and the discussions, what we're assuming is probably similar to what they're seeing is that we think that our expectations for next year are probably going to be very similar to what those are that you're hearing from the manufacturing partners. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would just add that, again, as Mike said, you're talking a little about the purchasing and the inventory. But there's also the market side, which is reimbursement pressures. And we have to live in that environment and so we're very sensitive to that. And that's a part of the dynamic as well. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, and also when we're in a net deflation environment, that doesn't mean there's no inflation. That just means that the net deflating items will be more than the net inflating items and that's how you get to a net deflationary. So don't interpret our comments to say we expect no generic inflation over the next year. I always believe there's going to be some. It's just going to be net down. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe touching on Red Oak. It's clear you've been very pleased with the results of your JV so far. But what's the bar you're trying to set in upcoming quarters and years to the extent you can share? So maybe taking a step back, now that you've established your joint venture as a successful purchasing entity in the past two years or so, what will Red Oak need to do in two years, three years from now in addition to what they're doing now for you to consider them to be a success? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a great question. I think some of the basic things you would have to do at any business. You've got to be able to add and develop talent and make sure that it's sustainable. And that's something that I have no concerns that we won't be able to do, but that is something that any business has got to do. I think you've got to continue to increase your data and analytics capabilities so you can understand and be more proactive on various opportunities to either lower cost or find new folks in the system that can help you get after increasing competition where you may need it on certain items, understanding what's going on in the API environment and working backwards. I think those are always important. Understanding really well what's going on with the various legal cases, all those types of things are really important as you work forward. And then obviously scale is important, too. And I believe that's another great piece about Red Oak is when you look at both Cardinal's success recently and over its history as well as CVS' progress, then you're going to see scale continuing to increase, which I think will always be beneficial to Red Oak. Operator : We'll go next to Greg Bolan of Avondale Partners. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. So just from a capital deployment standpoint, I know you guys obviously used $300 million of the $700 million this quarter. Just thinking about and in a sense going back to Bob's question earlier, moving from 2Q to 3Q obviously, a few levers were pulled, buyback being one of them. I guess as we think about moving into the fourth quarter, is there an opportunity to become more aggressive with the buyback authorization, or at this point feel pretty good with that $400 million, that should last at least through to the end of this year and obviously re-address what's authorized as you think about fiscal 2017? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, thanks for the question, Greg. As you can imagine, with a company with our scale and breadth, there's a lot of things going on from an M&A standpoint that we're constantly looking at as well as looking at whether stock repurchases is the right opportunity. So as far as the numbers go, you're right, we do have just a little less than $400 million left on our stock repurchase program. So if we do see some opportunity in the fourth quarter, if we do believe that is the right place to put capital, we do have some ability to do that without any further board authorization. But to be able to say whether we'll do that or whether we'll do an M&A, it's really hard for me to do at this time and something that I can just tell you we constantly evaluate where's the best place to deploy our cash. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : That's great. And then just one quick question going back to an earlier question on Medical segment operating profit. Organically it absolutely you can see that the incremental profit margin is accelerating in that business. Clearly that seems to be, George, going back your comments around the large number of SKUs that have been introduced on the branded side. I guess if you think about the mix in Medical segment revenues and profit, is it safe to say that the operating profit contribution from the branded products is around double that of the contribution to revenues? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Greg, let me try that. I don't think we can break that out for you. I'll probably answer more generally and I hope the color will be useful. We always see, and I mentioned this on prior calls, that on the branded side of Med Surg distribution, those have over a long period of time have been declining. What has been happening, and this is sort of what we've been describing to you guys, is that the range of services that we provide that are high value, the number of products that we're providing in our private label, the mix of our business, the work that Don and his team have done, is beginning to bear fruit. And so what we're seeing is what I would describe is our organic \u2013 what you'd call organic, it's so hard for me to actually parse that out these days, but some of our historical lines are doing very well. They're competing well in the market. We're expanding the products and services. And I think that's beginning to bear fruit. So I can't break out the components for you or predict it, but what I can say is that directionally is a very positive thing. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, the old numbers, just so you remember, was that our Cardinal Health preferred products and consumable products in total as a percentage of Med segment profit, as revenue it would be in the low-20s of Med revenues and in the higher-30s for Med segment gross margins. And that is something that we plan to update ay our June Dublin Day when Don gets into a little more detail about the Med segment and as he gets a chance to evaluate what's going on with the Cordis acquisition. But it's safe to say it will be much higher when you see it. Operator : We'll go to our next question from David Larsen of Leerink Partners. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. George, you mentioned in your prepared comments something about reimbursement rates to your customers. Can you expand on that a little bit more and maybe touch on hospitals, docs, retailers and how you see reimbursement rates trending for that group? And what do you think of this Part B rule that was proposed? What impact could that have on your business? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Dave, let me start with my comments were primarily addressing the retail side, but I'll be happy to weigh in on the others. So, yes, I think the dynamic obviously, all the payers, whether it's the government or private payers, are working very hard to contain cost, reimbursement is one of the tools that they have. And so as they press those customers, we have to be there to support our customers and make sure that they're able to compete and run their businesses. So it's just a dynamic in the market that we have to live with and we're very sensitive to. I think our customers trust that we understand this dynamic. As it relates to the Med B proposal, as you know, this got a lot of attention and got a lot of pushback. Let me start by saying it doesn't really have much impact on us very specifically, so that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt \u2013 we'll see CMS trying to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that that's just very, very hard to do and they've got to be careful as they do that not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world. So I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick and I think some with the system will say those are tough for us to adopt and they have adverse consequences. And this is probably one those ones where the market pushed back and particularly the physicians saying this was particularly painful for them. But this is part of the dynamic that we live with I think today. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Couldn't the biosimilar component of the Part B rule be a benefit to your model? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's an interesting question. I'll probably be a little careful in answering because it's so early. The biosimilars, Dave, are still emerging. As you know, because you don't have this driver of the AB rating, it doesn't get the kind of instant uptick that you see with the launch of a traditional generic drug. And so I guess hypothetically the answer is yes, but we have to just recognize we're in very early days on the biosimilar side and I think a lot to play out still. Operator : We'll go next to John Kreger of William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. George, earlier in the call you talk about a fair amount of customer consolidation within the Pharma Distribution business. Can you just remind us how you think that ripples through with pricing trends as some of those relationships come up for renewal for you? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have seen a fair amount of consolidation, certainly among the biggest players, biggest purchasers. I think, first of all, this is sort of unraveling \u2013 not unraveling, probably unwinding. Some of these are still in regulatory approval. I think in general consolidation is a phenomenon that we've experienced over a lot of years. We're used to it. I think the question that we think about when we look at those consolidated customers is not just are they bigger, but so they have new kinds of needs, to stick needs where we have tools that can support them. So I think the key for us as we think about these is not just whether or not we can be efficient in order to be price competitive, but as those combinations occur, do we have unique sets of skills that allow us to create value for those merged or different kinds of entities? I think increasingly we do. So I think it's clear that we have scale and that we can be price competitive. But I think it's also other things that we want to be able to bring to any player, whether or not that's on the institutional side in hospital and health systems, or whether it's on the retail side. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-up on the Medical side. Where are you seeing the best traction with your private label and branded products? If you could characterize that, I'm curious if it's the big IDNs, if it's smaller, are you seeing any patterns emerge as you get more scale in that business? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's a great question. I wish I could discern \u2013 we're very good at analytics. It would be very hard to discern a pattern. We do a lot of work to segment our customers. It really varies. It's very specific to the account, the nature of their buying organizations, how active the CFO in the C-suite is in the activities deeper in the organization. So it really varies a lot and it would be extremely hard to discern a very clear pattern. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Interesting. Okay. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our last question from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Just one question. George, you alluded to beforehand with naviHealth, just curious how you're looking some of the programs that are going on in that area, so like the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, also I think the more recently the Joint Replacement one. And can you talk about how naviHealth is helping you position there, particularly in BPCI? My understanding is that program is not really open, it's still sort of pilot. So where are we in terms of process and when do you think that's going to be broadly opened up for hospitals again? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. So let's start with the basics. I think some of these programs we just have to remember are in their early phases. But there is, Charles, I think no question that there's a push both from the public through Medicare/Medicaid and through private payers to try to encourage payment models that are not fee-for-service so that are some kind of value-based program. The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And, again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth history at helping hospitals direct care post-acute. But I think that that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this. I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable. And I think actually for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But, again, BPCI is early. CMMI, looking at that program, early days in all of these but the direction I think is unambiguous. I think there's more push to move away to the extent possible from the fee-for-service. And I think tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in Curaspan, which touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers, those kinds of tools I think are going to be increasingly valuable to us. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: With naviHealth, have you seen that already with the hospitals they serve and as you're looking to help direct the appropriate discharge location and that's how you can save money for the system? Is that advantaging on your AssuraMed side on the home distribution business yet? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of us here, again. Remember, it's early. But I think it's safe to say that the discussions that we're having with large institutions around naviHealth help us as Cardinal Health position ourselves in the big sense as understanding the challenges and the forces in the market and having sets of solutions and tools that we can bring to bear. So I think as an asset in the Cardinal Health portfolio, it is creating some unique conversations. And, again, I don't want to get ahead of us. It's early, but we're quite encouraged. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, guys. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing comments. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you all for joining us. It's been a long call. I appreciate you taking the time. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. I'll just finish by saying we're excited about the performance of the quarter, looking forward to times with you in June and those of you who'll be able to join us for Dublin Day. And I hope you have a good day. Thanks, all. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call. Healthcare is at an inflection point. The demands of an aging population, the challenges of public health, and continued policy debates around cost, quality, and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home that require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of healthcare. At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate, and lead. Our teams worked hard this past year integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities, and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value while never losing sight of the ultimate goal, serving patients and their families. This was also a period in which I participated in the healthcare system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skill, the dedication, and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be, and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most. Healthcare is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full-year performance and put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation. Also, as I've done in past years at year end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike, who will go into further detail on the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead, and our long-term aspirations. We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams from medical to pharma to corporate. First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14. For the year, we delivered strong, impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full-year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24. I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork, and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort, rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful, measurable growth while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic positioning. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest levels of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet, and integrating the operations of important acquisitions. First let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full-year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion. Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers while welcoming new ones. They've successfully concluded the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first-rate generics offering. As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. Two weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago, where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face. As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team has its finger on the pulse, driving meaningful relationships with our customers, and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs. Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy Network, which includes thousands of locally-owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentialing. Our pharmacies consistently rank among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact that our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings. And of course, our first-rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients, and our shareholders. For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business while working to make their communities stronger serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative. Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, this business not only met but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016. Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology, and oncology, now and well into the future. We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow. Our work in Specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Our Nuclear business has regained its footing. We've moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring their potential for new life-saving treatments for cancer patients. The way that we're working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding, is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the Nuclear segment. To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward. Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full-year revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY 2015 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care. Our OptiFreight and 3PL services and our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results for our partners. And the considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last two years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost effectively. While healthcare systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage these important changes. Our physician preference item strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high-quality manner for their patients. Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the Cordis acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient. Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks. To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between these trends and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solutions, offered through naviHealth, RightCare, and Curaspan, position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimal site of care, build the linkages to post-acute settings, and through our at Home business supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their healthcare experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health system adapts. While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our healthcare system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient, and centered around the patient. Second, a higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly and certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the healthcare experience. To highlight the significance and pace of change, just last week CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now-finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute-care hospitals would bear financial risk for an episode of care for an inpatient admission to 90 days post-discharge. Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device, to inventory management, to discharge management, to patient follow-up, all help providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities resident in naviHealth, RightCare, and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk. While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of rewarding hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers to avoid complication, prevent hospital readmissions, and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of healthcare. We have participated directly in bundles programs and will continue to work very closely with providers and payers as well as CMS to do our part to best serve patients. As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the systems challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and its future. With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY 2017 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%. Healthcare is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest, and every team that we welcome to the Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play in the next generation of healthcare. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients, their families, and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investments, and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future. I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, the manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support, and all of our employees for their deep commitment. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal 2016, and this just highlights the great work of our Pharmaceutical, Medical, and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success combined with our aspirational goals position us to deliver meaningful measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continue to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any three-year period of 10% to 15%. So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full-year highlights, and finally a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions. Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion, as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables. Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on slides three through slide 12 in our earnings presentation. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full-year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20%, to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full-year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion. GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by one basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter. Fiscal 2016 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 basis points and 19 basis points, respectively, again due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned. SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisitions, many of which George spoke about in his comments. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year. As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal 2015. The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY 2015 we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY 2016, full-year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%. Our fourth quarter and full-year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million respectively. During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which combined with our differentiated dividend payouts totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Moving on to consolidated cash flows, we generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal 2016 cash from operations to a record $3 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments. We also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions. Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally. Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day. Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to slide six and slide 10. Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and to a lesser extent performance from our Specialty business. For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions, and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the Specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal 2016 of $8 billion. Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement. For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricing and to a lesser extent reduced contributions from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier. Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug Group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions. Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and two basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full-year decline. All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year. Let's move to slide seven and slide 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and to a lesser extent Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses. Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full-year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal 2016 and which we've mentioned on prior calls. Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada. Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress. Our integration team has worked hard this year, and all day-one countries are stood up and providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization, and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years. We continue to work on closing and standing up day-two countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters, as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transition service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses, and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated. As we expected, we should be fully stood up and exiting our TSA agreements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years longer. Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multiyear growth. We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves, and we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 healthcare distributors in China. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal 2016 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on slide eight, you'll see three key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pre-tax antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal 2016, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS. So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are two items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early-adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range. So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Starting on slide 14, we expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9%, for a range of $5.48 to $5.73. On slide 15, we've outlined five corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full-year guidance on tax rates, as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items. Second, for fiscal 2017, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range. Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investment to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million, or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP. Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on slide 16; beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal 2017. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal 2016. While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range, as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also factor into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high single to low double digits year on year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back-half weighted versus the prior year. Let me provide some additional context on Pharma. As I mentioned just now related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal 2017 than we had experienced in fiscal 2016. We are modeling generic manufacturer price deflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal 2016, we had several key generic items that we had previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year. FY 2017 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we had incurred in 2016. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal 2017. Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of two predetermined payments, beginning in fiscal 2017. Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones, and we will be making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining eight years of the agreement. There are two other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal 2017. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digits again this fiscal year. So again to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends, and the Safeway loss which impacts the majority of fiscal 2017, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year. Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal 2017, which you can find on slide 17. We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion. Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from three key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal 2017 versus the prior year net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impacts as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority, and therefore some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and therefore solid contribution from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brand. In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions, as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year. On slide 18, we provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal 2016 finish to our fiscal 2017 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range. We've tried to size each of these core categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go-forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful. As you see on slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for total fiscal 2017 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS. The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment either through share repurchases, acquisitions, or a combination. Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal 2017 year-end that we outlined in our December 2013 Investor Day because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders. At that time, we outlined five goals we hoped to accomplish as we exited fiscal 2017 and which we said would require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals. First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail order customer that helps to increase our earnings but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings. Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target. Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this. Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal. And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health brand, services, and alternate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this. I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal 2016 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal 2017 and look forward to the year ahead. I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Eric Percher from Barclays. Please go ahead. David Ho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning. This is David Ho on for Eric. So my first question is on that $0.55 headwind from net customer activity. I was just wondering, Mike. Could you provide a little bit more detail? How much of that, or is the majority of that due to the Safeway loss? And I'm assuming it also includes repricing assumptions around customers like Prime and Kmart, so was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely; thanks for the question. Hopefully, you guys all found this slide to be helpful. Let me do this, just in case there's other questions. I'll give you a little bit of color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful. First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first three components -- net customer activity, generics program, and existing or remaining businesses -- those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range \u2013 of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that. There is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done. As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway. All of the repricings that we experienced that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings, and then the impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers. The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumptions and then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which again, while tailwinds, will be less than what we experienced in 2016 versus 2015. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there. In that final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as Specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of PMod [Pharma Modernization] that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color. David Ho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right; that helps definitely. And I guess my follow-up would be on that midpoint number, we've noticed that Cardinal has a history of exceeding that midpoint by about 6%, and I was wondering. Is there anything different this year versus prior years? Is this a year with less risk at the beginning of the year because maybe the generics piece -- there's less upside? So I'm just wondering if there's more room to grow from here. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that, as every year, I don't think it's any different than we try to do any other year. I would tell you that I believe this is an achievable plan. We've put a lot of thought into this. Clearly, there are a lot of different dynamics affecting the year, and we try to risk-adjust each and every one of those, so hopefully that helps a little bit. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. I appreciate you laying out the challenges to this year and respective of your long-term aspirations. As you are thinking about some of the temporal items that are affecting the business, how did you think about the pushes and pulls of maybe other things you could have done to accelerate the growth rate this year but maybe that's not in the best interest of the long term, whether it was getting more aggressive with acquisitions or something on the cost side? I'm just curious what the debate was like, and I guess it maybe speaks to the fact of your confidence in the long term that you felt like you didn't need to do something now. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ross. It's George. It's a little hard to answer that question, but let me do the best I can. We obviously have a goal of having this long-term creation of value for our shareholders, and of course on the short term making sure that we're hitting our numbers, executing, and are very disciplined. We've tried to continue that tradition. We will be very disciplined about the moves that we make, the way we deploy capital, the acquisitions we consider. All of those are really with the thought about where care is going and making sure we're on the right side of care. But again, we are very much focused on making sure that we do what we say we're going to do in the short term and that we execute very efficiently. But we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive the business. As you know, we're a pretty strong generator of cash, and capital deployment for us is a resource that we recognize is an opportunity for us to create value for all of you as shareholders. So we'll continue to bring that approach to it. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, for taking the question here. Maybe, George, I could ask you a question about Medical here. You were talking about as we move to episodes of care across 90 days, to change the way providers have been thinking about their costs. Are you saying that \u2013 are you then going to the market here trying to sell a suite of products that crosses the episode of care itself? So are hospitals really looking to buy maybe physician preference items that will be used for a case tied then to discharge planning? My understanding is that's not really how they buy today. How are those discussions going, and how quickly do you think we'll get there for people to think of it that way? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let me just respond to this broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in this sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate period to measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult, and the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed systems, where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcomes or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all of those programs. We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses given the fee-for-service model, but we now have some tools that are enabling particularly very large, complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them, whether or not it's reducing costs or standardization in the consumables, outcome of physician preference item strategy, which links the device and the services around it, where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge. So I think we're going to live in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned I think to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just so you have this, our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong, and I think it's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just to follow up, so naviHealth, if you think about really post-discharge planning, is that a decision made at what level in the hospital when you're going in? And then because I'm trying to think about how quickly we can start tying these types of different product lines or offerings together into a full suite offering. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You have to remember that naviHealth has two types of customers. They have payer customers and provider customers. I think the decisions, this kind of work tends to get relatively high in the organization. It's not necessarily made in one place, but I will say that because the implications of post-discharge costs are very significant for our customers, these activities, the work that we're doing in this area tends to move fairly high up into the organization. But decisions are really made throughout different parts of any customer. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. This is Zack in for Ricky. I wanted to ask first about the moving parts on the Pharmaceutical segment and how you think about what organic growth was in the quarter versus in fiscal 2016 and how that compares to the \u2013 I realize it's not organic, but the flattish expectation for growth in fiscal 2017. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for the question, Zack. I'm not going to get specific on the split between organic and non-organic within the segments. But if you think about our slide on page 19, we did split it down for the overall company to try to give you a little color in that we're expecting capital deployment, which will be the combination of stock repo and some tuck-in acquisitions, to be in the 2% to 3% range. And then we expect the business growth to be 3% to 6% in total. And again, if you remember, I did say that I expected the Pharma segment to be essentially flat for the year but a little different on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, thanks for that, and then a question on Specialty. So as you mentioned, Specialty is exceeding your targets and expectations for fiscal 2016. As you head into 2017 and further on, how do you think about Specialty impacting both your margins as well as your cash generation? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I continue to be very excited about what's going on in Specialty. Last year we wanted to give you a revenue goal, which we said was $8 billion, which we far exceeded. And really the reason we gave that last year, and it's probably not something we'll be giving forward, is because we want you to understand the scale and breadth of that business, that we've grown so quickly, that it's truly at a scale where we have all the relationships that we need with pharma manufacturers as well as the suite of services to serve providers downstream. We do continue to expect double-digit growth in the Specialty business for 2017. We're excited about both our offerings upstream to providers as well as downstream \u2013 or upstream to manufacturers and downstream to providers. So I think we're really well positioned in that business. I think that our margin rates, I think it's going to be higher margin rates on the upstream services to manufacturers. We're at typical distribution margin rates on the downstream services to the providers. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Zack, I would just add. Some of you probably will know, which is that, again, if you look at the pipeline coming out of the biopharmaceutical world, Specialty is going to continue to be a priority. So our positioning, as Mike said, both downstream with the providers and upstream with manufacturers, I think is quite strong right now. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Mike, going back to your comments on Cordis and the update to the accretion range, specifically on the increased SG&A investments that you guys are planning to make, could you just give us a little more detail behind the nature of these investments? And is there any change to your expectations for the top line contribution from Cordis? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : So thanks for the question on Cordis. First of all, I just want to make sure. We feel really excited about Cordis. We think things are going really well. We've got all of the key employees, management team, sales folks in place. Things are going incredibly well. So just a couple quick things to note, really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price and stuff but is obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX. Why I want to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business and that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally, and then exit off of those other agreements, we've decided to be, I guess I'd use the word conservative in the sense of managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher. So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters because in some cases it was as we were ramping up our expenses, we're still on the TSA, so we have slightly double expenses in certain periods as we then walk off the TSAs as we move country to country. Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then you also highlighted the record operating cash flow for the year. Just given your assumption for fiscal 2017, do you think that this level of cash flow performance is sustainable for next year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I think we're going to continue to have strong cash flow, but we don't guide specifically to cash flow, so I can't give that to you. But I think that we're going to be, just by the nature of our business and our strong focus on working capital, we're going to continue to have strong cash flow numbers. This was a record year, and it creates a lot of options for us to take a look at different ways to deploy that capital. Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks for the questions. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, next question? Operator : Yes, our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike or George, I'm going to go back to that slide 19 where you guys talked about the multiyear aspirations, and that was the 2013 to 2017 period. I guess if we think about the next five years, should we think of those multiyear aspirations as still holding, or is the most recent year, that being fiscal 2017, what we should think of as a more normalized run rate for the business? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I wanted to make sure that I did emphasize \u2013 we still believe that over any three-year period we can achieve 10% to 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. So whether you look at 2016 through 2018 or 2017 through 2019 or going forward, there's nothing at this time that as we project out what we think we can do, not only with the strong position and performance of our businesses but also with our significant and disciplined approach to capital, that we think we can still continue to deliver the 10% to 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. And then on the dividend payout, we intend to continue to differentiate that dividend and keep our payout in that 30% to 35% range, which is again something we feel with our strong cash flow and continued earnings growth we're going to be able to continue to do. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess just if we think about \u2013 you highlighted the moving pieces in the guidance in fiscal 2017. If we look at the core U.S. drug distribution business, recognizing that there's the Safeway roll-off, Nuclear, Specialty, and China are all growing fast, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is on a like-for-like basis, is the core U.S. DSD business expected to be flat or actually shrink in fiscal 2017? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I can't go into a split again with the core other than what I gave you from an overall Cardinal standpoint. I will tell you, though, that remember that we mentioned a few other things related to the Pharmaceutical segment and the assumptions. So from a headwind standpoint, Safeway, as you clearly mentioned, is a headwind. Also, we have our normal repricings. Then we have the headwind from the increased expense we're going to incur this year, which we specifically related to our Pharmaceutical IT investments because we've had such significant growth in our Pharmaceutical business, including acquisitions, that that will be an important area for us. And then the generic manufacturer deflation that we've talked about, the impact on our business on that, and then specifically the manufacturer branded agreements that we talked a little bit. But I do want to make sure you know that PD is not shrinking. We feel really good about the strength of all of our businesses in PD, both China, Specialty, and the core PD businesses. And then the tailwinds that we've talked about, as I mentioned just those, remember, just one other thing I mentioned that's important, we expect Red Oak and generic launches to continue to be tailwinds for us, but just less in 2017 versus 2016 than they were 2016 versus 2015, just because of the nature of the generic launches. There are fewer of them out there and because we synergized Red Oak so quickly and we had a lot of impact from it in 2016. And again, it will be positive in 2017 but less than it was in the previous year. Operator : And our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and thanks for all the comments. George, I'm wondering if you can just maybe talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace for your contracts that you have with manufacturers that are not under inventory management agreements. Are you seeing any changes at all in the marketplace? And obviously, we have seen some of these manufacturers that have gone through some changes. Are they changing the way they're contracting with you at all? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Lisa. I'll start and then I'll let Mike jump in. Actually, we're not really seeing any noteworthy change here. Relationships with our manufacturers are really good. Again, we have different product lines that we're seeing launched these days, so more products that are coming through Specialty. But I would say in general, the basic tone of the conversations is positive, and the basic nature of contracting is quite similar. So, Mike, I don't know if you want to add there. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The only thing I would add, Lisa, that maybe is a slight change that would be important to note is that typically in the past, we said that about 80% of our fees from branded manufacturers were non-contingent to inflation. And with recent renegotiations of agreements and various moving parts, we expect that to be 85% at a minimum this coming year. And so that means that now 15% or less of our margins on branded manufacturers will be subject to inflation, which again I think reduces the overall risk and exposure going forward. And as you've heard me say in the past, on that 15% that is contingent, we view that in a thoughtful way working with manufacturers that we believe can still deliver a consistent type of return for us. So I think that's probably the only slightly moving part that I've seen with our agreements. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions, a couple clarification questions actually. So on Red Oak, I was under the assumption that it was already a nice run rate, but you stated the incremental contributions. Just to be clear, is this just the normal benefit as volumes increased for the JV, or are there new functions Red Oak will be taking on? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me start. And again, I'll make sure Mike clarifies if it's not clear. So really, what we were trying to say was the benefit as you move from 2017 to 2016 is less than the benefit that occurred from 2016 to 2015 because it was really the ramp-up basically. So we really had \u2013 the first year ramp-up was more dramatic, but the general direction is positive. I would say the relationship right now is really strong. Red Oak is a highly functioning operating entity with some scale, and so we continue to explore ways to create value from that. Mike is on the board. Is there anything you want to add? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The only color I would add I think if I understand where you're going was, while I would tell you we were fully ramped up, with any sourcing business, every year you challenge yourself to take cost out and get better and better, whether it's on the Medical side, where the team this past year did an excellent job of continuing to take cost out on our Cardinal Health branded products and the ones we source no different than Red Oak Sourcing. I was at our board meeting just last week, and I continue to be impressed with the data analytics and analysis the team are doing as they look for opportunities to lower our cost and again work with manufacturers in different and unique ways that we hope are win-wins, with always the goal being transparent and clear with our manufacturers. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I guess where I was going with that is with that nice slide on page 18 with the bridging from 2016 to 2017. The generics programs line has $0.35 attributed to it. So just trying to figure out how much of that was marketplace dynamics versus very unique to Cardinal's Red Oak program. So it sounds like most of that is from just the marketplace dynamics of generics coming on board. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I would say Red Oak is going to be one of the big positives in there. Generic launches will be a positive, and then generic penetration will be a positive. And then on the flip side, what we're seeing in terms of generic deflation is the negative in there that offsets some of those upsides. And again, as George and I both mentioned, the upsides from Red Oak and launches were a little smaller this year. But also remember, it's really basically impossible to pull apart all those pieces because they all work in tandem together. When you see pricing pressure, you're looking for cost renegotiations, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot of that works together, which is why we grouped it together. Operator : And our next question comes from Greg Bolan from Avondale Partners. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Hey. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here. Just keep it real quick. So if we think about where your minds were very end of April the last time we spoke with regards to generic deflation and where your minds are today, our work suggests that the ratio of inflationary to deflationary generic prices has really come back into a more normalized level, maybe even still slightly above a normalized level, certainly less than 0.5%. Has that changed at all just in terms of your mindset? Does it seem like there's more of a stabilization? And as we think about the back half of fiscal 2017 into the first half of fiscal 2018 \u2013 I know we don't want to get too far out -- but just does it feel like from a year-on-year comparable basis it's starting to stabilize? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So why don't I start just giving some historical perspective, and then I'll let Mike jump in. This is the environment that we've been in now for quite a number of months, and so we have over the years seen these swings from time to time. And over the last couple years is a particularly noteworthy stretch. But I would say this is a dynamic with which we're familiar. And I'm not sure that it's changed our mindset in any way. I think we understand the nature of the market. This is a kind of market we've lived in. We're extremely effective at sourcing products, and I think our teams do a great job of commercializing them, and I think we've been picking up new customers. So generally speaking, I'm not sure that our mindset has changed in any way. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I would agree with George on that in terms of a mindset. This is an environment we know how to operate in. And again, I think we're incredibly well positioned with our partnership with CVS Health, with Red Oak, and the investments we're making in our pricing and analytics teams across both Cardinal and at Red Oak. There are less items going up in price if you're talking about that from a mix standpoint. But when you take a look at the core items, whether you look at it and look at items four years older or two years older or how many players, generally we're seeing similar deflation to what we saw in historical periods in those buckets. We're just tending to see fewer and less larger I guess increases when we do see the increases, which I think is having the impact which you saw from a few years ago. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that's right. The difference is really in a relatively small set of the total. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks, guys. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, George or Mike, you mentioned the Cardinal at Home products a few times here. You're expecting above market growth here. What's incremental to that strategy for 2017? Why are you so upbeat that it's going to grow above the market? And then secondarily, where does that stand as a gross margin driver for you in your hierarchy of things? Is this in the top bucket, or is that too small to care about at this point? George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bob. I don't think it's small. Again, this is a good contributor to us. I think the drivers of growth here are largely demographic. I think what we see is an increasingly aging population. And so I think in general, the winds are going in our direction here. We have more patients being discharged, in some cases more quickly. As you know, the incentives are changing a bit. We are competing very, very effectively. We are generating more flow of Cardinal brand, which is actually still in its relatively early phases of work. So I would say as we are able to drive more of our own Cardinal brand through that channel, it actually makes us more effective. And that's a little bit of that flywheel that we've seen in other parts of the business, where as we can create more product flow-through, it's more efficient for the customers, which creates more volume, which allows us to do that much more effectively. And so I think that's the key to that business model. And we feel very good about our ability to source, drive Cardinal Health products, and expand our presence in that channel. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The only thing I would add, Bob, around your question about why we're above market is I think a couple other things hit me. One is we have tremendous billing capabilities there and also outstanding payer relationships. We think we probably have \u2013 not probably have \u2013 I think we have the largest breadth of relationships with payers. So we make it easy for discharge planners and folks (1:10:43) when they want a one-stop shop to go to someone who can handle all of the needs of the patients to come to us. So I think our ability to make it easier for those folks, our breadth of our line, including the Cardinal Health products, as well as I would tell you I really believe in the team up there is some outstanding folks I think are the reasons why we're growing above market. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Is there any change in the retail strategy itself of how many storefronts you might be selling through? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say there's any change, but we continue to grow that relationship with our various customers. The team is doing a nice job. Jon and Don work together across P&M [Pharmaceutical and Medical] to look for opportunities and work with, whether it's retail, independents, regional chains or large chains, to find opportunities where we can help them create endless aisles in this area of these type of products and us to be their back office for them. So we are absolutely continuing to cross-sell those products. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right; thank you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger at William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks, a quick follow-up on slide 19, Mike. The 10% to 15% longer-term EPS growth goal -- should we assume that there's any capital deployment in that number? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely, that assumes that there will be capital deployment in that number. It'll be a combination of stock repurchases, acquisitions, as well as any capital deployment we use for capital expenditures. So it clearly includes capital deployment. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And by the way, when we went back to the Analyst Day a couple years ago when we laid out these goals, that was also something we articulated. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, and then just a similar follow-up. If you think about your segment-level guidance for 2017, are there any additional acquisitions baked into either the Pharma or Medical guidance? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : At this time, the only acquisitions that would be baked in, in a sense, because there are no real acquisitions baked in, but we said that capital deployment would be 2% to 3%. So we have given some room in there to either do some small tuck-in acquisitions or to be able to do some additional repo. So from that sense, from an overall company standpoint, there is some I guess capital deployment that could be either acquisitions or stock buyback embedded in our earnings guidance, but no specific company necessarily at this point in time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, good morning, George and Mike. We've also been publishing an EPS bridge from fiscal 2016 to 2017 as well, so I'm glad you guys are on board with the same concept. I truly don't want to get granular as I try to compare on this call, but I would say just big picture, we had a benefit from new generic launches but an equal sized hit from generic price erosion on older products. So we were right around zero or neutral for generic profits for Cardinal overall for fiscal 2017. You guys obviously have a positive $0.35 contribution at your midpoint. I just wanted to try to dive into that a little bit deeper on what some of the positive contributors are. The first question might be, do you have generic pricing as a positive contributor or subtraction? And also, are you anticipating maybe a lot of unit volume growth in generics within your customer base that might be driving a lot of that earnings as well? I just wanted to get more color on that $0.35. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : The three positives that are in there would be Red Oak Sourcing would be the most significant of the positives in there, again, the year-over-year benefit. I've mentioned a couple times it's smaller than 2016 versus 2015, but it's still a very important number to us. So that's clearly a positive. Generic launches are a positive again, while smaller than the prior year. And then we also do have some assumption of penetration of current accounts, that we will be able to take some of the generics that they're buying directly from other folks and buy them through us. So those are the three positives or the tailwinds. And then on the negative side, it's the generic deflation issue and the impact that that creates from inventory gains as well as the impact on our selling prices. That impact of generic deflation is the bad guy in there that we've talked about in the past. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And would Harvard accretion be in there? I don't know if somebody asked that or not. Was that part of that? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : No, Harvard would be down in the \u2013 overall performance would be down in the third bucket, existing or remaining businesses. We just put all of that down in that bucket. Operator : And our next question comes from David Larsen from Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Mike, could you talk a bit about the operating margin in the Medical division? I think you mentioned there were a couple of one-time benefits last quarter. It just seemed like the sequential delta there was fairly significant. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for the question. So in Medical, this was what we predicted in our last quarter. We thought with all of the moving parts on Cordis related to the building up of internal expenses to take over the various operations being managed by J&J right now on the transition service agreements that we would have some variability between where we're ramping up and ramping down. We also have some FX impact in there. And then there are a few other puts and takes that we've had between the quarters that are just creating some variability. And so I'd probably look more at Q3 and Q4 combined than I would to try to look at any one single quarter over the last couple quarters. And this noise will begin to reduce as we go over the next couple quarters and begin to get off the TSA agreements by our fourth quarter this year. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, fantastic. And then, Mike, I know you led the Pharma division for a long time. You probably know more about Pharma pricing than pretty much lots of folks on the planet. How is Red Oak performing relative to your expectations? And what's going to turn that 20% decline in Pharma operating income in 1Q around so dramatically? It sounds like you're going to have to have a pretty good growth rate in 2Q and 3Q going forward. In your view, what's the one or two things that's going to turn that around? Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for that question, a couple things. First of all, remember, a big reason for that Q1 decline is really how incredibly strong Q1 of 2016 was. If you remember, back then I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very much higher-priced than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated, and so they're not creating as much margin. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year, where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those two big things that are there. And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers, which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics. Some of the good work we're doing on Harvard, Specialty, Nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma. But I don't think there's anything in there. We don't have to pull a rabbit out of a hat or anything to get there. I think Jon and his team have a really great set of plans to execute and get us where we need to be. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Dave, if I could just add to it, our Pharma business is competing really effectively right now. Our position is really strong. I love where we are with our customers. Red Oak Sourcing is really effective. So as Mike said, there are some somewhat unique things in the comparative data, but we really like the positioning. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, I think we are going to try to go through the rest of the questions in the queue, if we can. Operator : Indeed, we have one final question actually from Mr. Eric Coldwell from Robert Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Actually my question was covered just a minute ago and for the second time. I'll let you guys wrap up. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Eric. Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Eric. Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Eric. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. So, Mr. Barrett, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you. George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, thank you. Listen, I know all of you have a really busy day today. We appreciate your jumping on a little early with us today and very much appreciate your joining us for the call. So we hope to see many of you in the coming weeks. Thanks to all of you and have a good day. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We hope to see many of you in upcoming events. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George Barrett : Thanks Sally. Good morning, everyone and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I will focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity. Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with two lenses : one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines and the other, the environment in which we compete. Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the on-boarding of some very strategically important customers in the med segment. We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. The public discourse around drug pricing has at least for the moment had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite sometime for our industry. Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment. One more pressures to be efficient or relentless were the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically siloed or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other healthcare players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business. Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary healthcare expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver everyday for those we serve. These are the characteristics at the moment, some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwinds. Of course, I would like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye in the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world. With this as backdrop and modeling in and adjusted for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today\u2019s challenges, embracing tomorrow\u2019s opportunities for our customers and shareholders. Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed. However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offering has never been stronger and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers. Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well driven by both our provider facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of services is well-aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating these challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with a clear eye towards managing efficiency. Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we have developed with our customers. Everyday, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care. Our Cardinal Health brand of products continue to be a driver of growth for this segment as we increase our account penetration and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we on-boarded a large complex customer in our medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line. October 2 marked the year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration thoughtfully phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen over this past year that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. We have also seen growth in some important markets, including Europe where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for a measurable growth over the long-term. Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to at our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value. While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt by working with our customers holistically, driving our own efficiencies and delivering integrated effective solutions, we have developed strong partnerships with our customers. We remain committed to focusing our product lines and capabilities around the patient to position ourselves to capitalize on the changes in our industry. And to the collective drive and dedication of our 37,000 people, we will continue to deliver meaningful results and measurable growth for our customers, patients and shareholders. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks George and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter. I would like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that with all of my comments, I will begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figures. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables. Our first quarter fiscal 2017 results were about as we expected, with GAAP diluted EPS at $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24, a 17% and 10% decrease, respectively. In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment, as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment and that\u2019s largely what we saw. I will discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with the consolidated company results. Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year\u2019s first quarter. We continued to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%. Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase program. In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance including short-term investments was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally. Now let\u2019s move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase. Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation, as well as the previously announced loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the on-boarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the on-boarding of this large mail order customer. Getting back to Red Oak, as we have mentioned in the past, if it achieved certain milestones, it would trigger the second of two predetermined payments beginning in FY \u201817. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we have made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement. Let\u2019s now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated on-boarding of a new large medical distribution customer. The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates. Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment. Before moving to our fiscal year \u201817 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you will see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition related costs. Next, I would like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don\u2019t typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis. Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around this adjustment by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions. Turning to Slide 10, all but two of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately $385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings. On Slide 11, there are three updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we have previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY \u201817 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid to high single-digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and while much less of an impact lower than anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted. Now, turning to the Medical segment, all of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid single-digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit. Now, turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we have updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren\u2019t providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Net customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced. Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So, as you can see, we have now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described. To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continued to aspire to the long-term goals we communicated before. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing, and to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and Nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business. On the Medical side, we have also won some important new medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale and sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business. Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth. And with that, operator, let\u2019s begin our Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. Bob Jones : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. George Barrett : Good morning. Bob Jones : Good morning. George, you talked about the moderation in the pricing environment, but I think your comment seems largely focused on the buy side part of the business. I have just obviously want to get your views on the sell-side side of the business given your peer last week talked about more aggressive pricing in the retail independent channels? So, I just wanted to see what you are seeing there currently? George Barrett : Hi, Bob. Good morning. Yes, actually my comments really were about the overall pricing environment. So, I was talking about sell side as well. And here is my perspective, there are, as I mentioned, number of factors coming together to make this a bit of a unique moment. So, we are not going to overreact to that moment. Our position, our plans for growth really aren\u2019t different than today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We are an extraordinary attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are extensive, that\u2019s what is part of our positioning. So, that\u2019s I think important to stay upfront. But no, I think we are describing some similar characteristics to what you described. Bob Jones : Okay, great. And then I guess, Mike, if I could just go over to the guidance. Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you are assuming around profit margins there or overall profits there, mid to high single-digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those two things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you are suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Bob. Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked \u2013 when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn\u2019t really talking about the headwind tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products, because that\u2019s about where we model it to be this year. We are not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment and that\u2019s what we are seeing. So, that\u2019s not really the driver. What we are talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That\u2019s where we are seeing the uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that\u2019s really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers. As I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation. So, we have said about 10% before on brand inflation. We are now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact, I guess I will put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn\u2019t probably be adjusting guidance. It\u2019s more the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that\u2019s the first thing I want to say. The second thing, I can understand why you maybe have a little trouble with your numbers. I can\u2019t quote exactly or comment on exactly what the number should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren\u2019t going to show up in the segment numbers, because we don\u2019t push those down at the end of the year, so probably the piece that you are missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up, midpoint down, the last bucket that you are missing is that the corporate numbers we are going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket. Operator : And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Sally Curley : Hi, Charles. George Barrett : Hello. Sally Curley : You may need to take your phone off mute. Operator : Hearing no response. Sally Curley : Hey, operator, yes let\u2019s go back to Cowen if they get back in queue. Let\u2019s go to the next. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So Mike and George, you guys just commented a little bit on the downstream, the sell side dynamics, but on the independent front, you guys aren\u2019t as active as some of your peers, so just wondering, what specific segments are you seeing that and if you can you just give a little bit more flavor as to sort of the more recent trends into this month as to sort of the dynamics and how they are trending, that would be great? George Barrett : Garen, good morning, let me start and then Mike jump in. Actually, we have a very strong position with independents and have for quite some years. So the dynamic Mike described, we are seeing in that segment. So I don\u2019t have to add to that. Mike, anything? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I mean we have a lot of programs, services. We continue to stay very, very focused on that bunch of customers. We continued to have very high retention rates. And so we feel really good about where we are positioned in the generic independent space. Garen Sarafian : Okay. I guess do you sort of \u2013 are you seeing that in other segments other than just the independents or sort of the [indiscernible] kind of lead to or is it still just focused specifically and only on that segment? George Barrett : Let me try. I think it\u2019s probably been the most intense there. We often have to deal on it. This is sort of a normal thing with re-pricing of contracts. Thankfully, as you know, we have not had a lot of big contracts up for renewal. But I think it has been a distinctly noteworthy environment in independents, would you say, Mike? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I would totally agree with that. And I think you have to think about the way contracts are written and just certain customers contracts are written in ways that the generic pricing or the way it works is one way in the other areas, it\u2019s much more competitive for they haven\u2019t committed to buy all their generics and so they are constantly shopping them and that\u2019s where you are going to see and that\u2019s typically in independent space. And that\u2019s where you are going to see some more of these competitive pressures. Garen Sarafian : Okay, that\u2019s useful. And then I just have a follow-up, on the upstream, on the branded inflation side with the branded manufacturers, the moderating inflation has been sort of a fact that has been discussed in prior quarters and I thought that at some point, there was an opportunity to go back to the branded manufacturers and sort to readjust and realign the contract so it benefits all, so I am wondering have you done that in between contracts yet or is it sort of still waiting until the contract renews where those conversations come up again? And I will stop... George Barrett : Yes. Thanks. Good questions. And I would say that\u2019s really kind of across the board. It just depends on the individual manufacturer. As you know, about 15% of our branded margins are based on a contingent basis, which means that generic or a branded inflation is a piece of the driver of the value that we receive. And every one of those where we are not getting the value that we believe we should be compensated for the services that we deliver. We are having discussions with the manufacturers. Some of those are going to move quicker than others depending on contract date and based on prior discussions with those manufacturers on how those deals will arrive. And so you can imagine with every manufacturer where we believe we are being compensated less than we should have been or should be we are working with those manufacturers. Sally Curley : Next question. Operator : We now have Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Sorry about that earlier. Yes. Thanks George. You were talking in also your comments about \u2013 sorry, Mike, you were talking about your comments making the second payment to CVS as related to Red Oak, how much \u2013 can you kind of help us understand how much more of a benefit do you think you are getting right now this year on your generic procurement and how much of a benefit can we anticipate that we should get the rest of this year. And I guess the point I am trying to get at is, you talked about your overall estimate on generic deflation, how much is this procurement benefit do you think is helping offset, because I think George, in relation to your earlier comment to Bob\u2019s question, you did kind of mentioned that you are starting or you are seeing a similar kind of characteristics in the market relative to comments from last week? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes. I would say clearly, the number one offset to what we are seeing in the competitive pricing generics has been and should continue to probably be Red Oak Sourcing. I continued to be impressed with the team there, the depth of talent that we have on the team, the way they are looking at things, the creative ways they are working with manufacturing partners. And CVS Health couldn\u2019t be a better partner working together with us to drive value at Red Oak. So Red Oak would continue to be a positive driver for us when it comes to offsetting that. Charles Rhyee : And then is there any other things that we can think about that can be offsets or \u2013 I guess the other way I would say it is, when you think about the impact that you are seeing potentially in the independents, does your guidance kind of extrapolate out potentially what that might look like throughout your entire book of business or are you only kind of anticipating what you are seeing currently? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes. We have said that we have lots of different things. One of the things that I think is really helpful for Cardinal in general is our broad portfolio. So while we are seeing pressure from generic pricing and as I have said, to a lesser extent, branded inflation, when you look across the rest of the P segment, whether it would be how we are performing particularly in specialty, how we are getting in working through with Nuclear and some of our other components within that business, we continued to drive value in other areas. As you can imagine, when you are in a challenging environment like that, everyone, whether you are in P, M or corporate, is focused on expense control and making sure we are very diligent on those types of things. And so we have that benefit. As I mentioned, Medical is continuing to do very well. We expect them to have a very good year. And they are going \u2013 moving along as planned. And so I do think our broad portfolio of having Medical being able to drive some initiatives at a corporate level, which are going to show up at the end of the year, as well as some of the other parts of Pharma, are what we will be able to use. And using our balance sheet too, from a capital deployment standpoint through M&A and stock repo is how we are going to continue to manage the rest of the year. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher : Thank you. I am going to return to the question of the independents and pricing, it feels like there is a pretty big difference in the magnitude of pressure that we see in your guidance as compared to one of your peers. And Mike, I know you have been willing to go into some of the mechanics on items like brand inflation in the past, if we think about the mechanics of independent contracting, could you tell us a little bit about how much of the book is truly small and mid-size customers versus larger buying groups of independents and do you see significant differences in those. And maybe the last part of that would be do you have any major contracts that may be coming up or how much \u2013 how important are those? George Barrett : Yes. Let me try a couple of things and feel free to follow-up with another question if I miss it, but a couple of different things. First of all, I hate to ever comment on our competitors\u2019 numbers. Well, I just want to be careful with those. But remember, mix matters. And what I mean by mix is how much of their mix may be brand and generic versus our mix. If you look at the other components of our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment with our growth in specialty, nuclear and other things, so it\u2019s hard to comment on all the various moving parts of any of our competitors on what\u2019s in those segments. Second of all, I think you hit on something which is customer re-pricings and we didn\u2019t have very few \u2013 we have basically a very few major re-pricings this year and obviously, over the next couple of years, we don\u2019t have a ton of those. We are in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we are seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large re-pricings with some of their customers, which can affect each one of us in different timing within the years. And so I think it really gets back to mix of customers, timing of re-pricings. And those types of things can drive differences between each one of us, as well as maybe the expectations that we originally set at the beginning of the year and how we looked at things. Eric Percher : That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up would just be having exposure to telesales and Harvard, has that changed your insight into the market and/or your exposure to the market? George Barrett : Yes. I think in some ways, a little bit of both, because a lot of their sales are into the independent market. You can imagine we are seeing some competitive generic pricing against our telesales business, which obviously is a little bit of a headwind for that group. But on the flipside, because we do have so many contacts into the independent and the regional chain space with our telemarketing business, it gives us a lot of competitive intel on what market price is. And we stay very focused to try and make sure that we are pricing at that market price and not trying to do anything outside of that, because we believe we have a great service offering that we don\u2019t need to price below market in order to win and compete effectively. Eric Percher : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. So, you guys compete on the pharma side, right and the industry structure primarily is an oligopoly, right? So for many years, we haven\u2019t seen these sorts of spurts of aggressive competitiveness. And obviously, it\u2019s a tough environment. But when you look back at prior periods and talk to folks in the organization have been looking at this longer than probably myself. What are the key telltale signs of sort of the end of that, right? So looking for, okay, we saw flare up, something happened and then behavior returned back to more normal. I mean, is it \u2013 and then, so one, what should we be looking forward to judge whether or not this is sort of temporal? And then secondarily, how do you ultimately go back to that customer group and recapture some value, right, because inherently your business model has been delivering a ton of value to the independent base for a very long time. Obviously, the margin levels take a hit and then historically they have come back. And so help us think about those the sequence of sort of what happens next, I guess? George Barrett : So Ross, why don\u2019t I start? First, let me start by saying we always operate in a competitive environment. That is the nature of our business. Obviously, I have been doing this as is Mike for quite some time. We have lived through multiple cycles for me and multiple parts of the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You have got all of the public discourse around healthier sides in Pharma, it\u2019s loud and it\u2019s emotional. And at the same time, healthcare is going through some changes. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shocking that there is some near-term disturbance. Experience \u2013 my experience tells me that over time, you see some shifting out and just essentially settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don\u2019t result in a much change or a value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we have lived through different cycles in the past and that\u2019s what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work \u2013 you have heard the positioning that we have had over these last 7 or 8 years, it\u2019s really been about broad value creation and we will continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, they build and create value. And so we will continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industries. So, that\u2019s my general point of view. Ross Muken : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just quickly, Mike, on the balance sheet, I mean you guys are in a pretty strong position here. You talked about dislocations a bit in some of the pharma service part of the market, I am assuming to private and other competitors that\u2019s they are also painful, I mean, what about the M&A pipeline at this point? And obviously, you are doing a lot on the repurchase and you have a healthy dividend, but there is a lot of balance sheet capacity there. Could we see you guys get more active again? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Couple of comments. I think it\u2019s good to hear you mention the dividend, because that\u2019s something I would like to stress, because I think we have a very differentiated dividend and it\u2019s something that we continue to be committed to our 30% to 35% payout. And I think that is a very much a differentiator between us and others. And so I agree with that on one side. Again, I would tell you that when it comes to the deployment of capital, we would love to find great M&A targets that\u2019s probably where we would lean overstock repo, but we are going to stay disciplined. If we can\u2019t find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we are not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So, I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it\u2019s always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that, but we continue to be very active in the M&A front, but won\u2019t trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can\u2019t find the right opportunities. Ross Muken : Thanks Mike. Operator : Next, we have Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hey, good morning. So, couple of questions here. First of all, does your guidance assume any additional step down in distribution sell-side pricing offering independent books? So, did you assume that a step-down in the pricing that you are seeing in the marketplace today will spillover to your entire independent book? Mike Kaufmann : Well, I guess the only way I can respond to that is, as I mentioned in my remarks, our guidance includes not only what we saw in Q1, what I have kind of foreshadowed in Q2, but also that it was based on some of the trends we are seeing in Q1 and in Q2. So yes, it does include some continued challenges with generic pricing and branded inflation. George Barrett : Let me just add to this, Ricky. I mean generally, market price is a very effective market, very efficient market. So, the market just tends to be the market. And so you can\u2019t think of this as necessarily individual customers. Ricky Goldwasser : So \u2013 but George, doesn\u2019t that mean if there is risk that you may have to lower your prices in the future to match a new lower price point in the market volume? So, I guess the question is, is there any lower price point in the market? George Barrett : We are always lowering our pricing in the generic market. It always has been that way. And so generally, you constantly are competing on generics. All we are saying is that, right now, it\u2019s just a little bit of an unusual period of time where we are seeing a little more aggressive re-pricing. But there is always some re-pricing built into your go forward. We are always going to price the market. We are not ever trying to leave the market down, but we are in the \u2013 we believe the best competitive position from a cost standpoint that we can always stay competitive. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Greg Bolan : Great. Thanks, guys. So, if I could just maybe qualify what you said here is, on the distribution side, your margins on the buy side are about the same, your margins on the sell side downstream have got a little bit worse. And so that\u2019s a). And then b), Mike, if we could go back to this time last year, I mean, if I remember correctly, you guys were already kind of dealing with a little bit of a difficult comp on the distribution margin side. If I remember correctly, you guys got about, I think called out $0.08 of incremental tailwind from generic pricing this time last year, and I think about $0.03 from synergies from acquisitions. So, could you maybe talk a little bit about that and kind of how much of this year-over-year difficult comp kind of played into 1Q? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes, thank you. I did mention that in my remarks that part of the reason for our Q1 is the comps and that\u2019s why we called out Q1 being down was. And you were right on with that. We did have $0.08 last year that we called out favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought we are going to deflate last year that didn\u2019t and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year. As well as from an overall basis, remember, we had a favorable tax component last year too. And then in last year, we did see the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So, that\u2019s right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into two components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is then either raising or lowering price. We are seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics, but it\u2019s really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned \u2013 as we mentioned in the past, FY \u201814 was a good year, \u201815 was a solid year and then it started coming down in \u201816 and we kept calling down and we said we expected that to be down and that\u2019s how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year. So again, we are not seeing anything real different when it comes to what the manufacturing actions are related to inflation and deflation. It is the competitive environment downstream in our actual pricing out for the customers. Greg Bolan : That\u2019s great. And then just real quickly, if I kind of think back to Kinray 6 years ago now and what you guys have been able to do there, what Kinray and other kind of worked in or sort out on the community pharmacy side, I think you guys are now one of the largest, if not the largest, in the independent pharmacy space, with high 20% market share. And then as I think about the competitive dynamics around that market, I mean you guys have kind of lived in a world where you have been constantly trying to take share and been successful at that, it doesn\u2019t sound to me like this \u2013 it certainly doesn\u2019t sound as to what you are saying today is as draconian as maybe what we were kind of \u2013 what I was set up for going into the weekend and so \u2013 I mean is \u2013 if you think about \u2013 you keep saying short-term, you think it\u2019s transient, George, I mean what needs to happen over the next say, years for you guys to kind of maybe mitigate this \u2013 on the downstream margin side and kind of how you are positioned to continue to maintain or even grow market share going forward? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes. So Greg, let me start. This is really important. Our market share, I mean our independent has grown over years basically. It\u2019s not a sudden phenomenon. Actually, right now, it\u2019s relatively stable. So it\u2019s possibly growing over the 7 years of this team\u2019s leadership here. Obviously, the Kinray acquisition gave us a very significant boost there. So that\u2019s not a sudden thing. It\u2019s been a thoughtful and purposeful strategy to make sure that we have a good balance to our business. And we really feel like we create a huge amount of value for those independents to the service offerings and product lines, especially as the world is unfolded as it is. So start by that. I don\u2019t think there is a discrete moment of change. We are obviously in the middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle clearly is creating an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We will see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market probably each product differently. And I think again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. And so that\u2019s my experience over a lot of years. And so I think at the moment, right now, has a lot factors coming together to make for a tough environment, but we are going to stick to our value proposition and our long-term view as to how we compete in the market and how important service and product offerings are. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thank you and good morning. George, I just want to go back to your comments around the branded side and that primarily everything today is driven more on the generic side and pricing competition, but you brought the branded expectation down from roughly 10% down to the expectation of 7% to 9%, can you talk, is that what you are seeing right now, is that kind of your future look, we have heard from a number of manufacturers that they are lowering their expectation into what their price inflation will be in calendar \u201917, so I want to understand that, number one. And number two, I just want to understand because the way that I have historically thought about this is that 15% that\u2019s on a contingent basis was probably more profitable than a fee-for-service contract and so drug price inflation would have a bigger impact on that component of the business, I just want to know if I am thinking about that correctly? George Barrett : Mike, do you want to start on this one and then I can jump in? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. So actually, the 15% piece was margin dollars, it wasn\u2019t number of contracts. So it was assumed to be \u2013 of our margin dollars generated. I wouldn\u2019t say that, that group was a lot more profitable. A lot of the folks that are in there are obviously the smaller manufacturers, but so it\u2019s going to have an overall a little higher average rate because just by the nature of being smaller manufacturers. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big component of it. As far as what we have seen so far, I would tell you that what we have seen so far has been pretty light when it comes to manufacturer inflation. But that all being said, really January, as you know, our Q3 or the first quarter of our calendar year is always a big quarter for the branded manufacturer price increases. And the 7% to 9% is really an average for the entire year. So while it\u2019s a little lighter than we would have expected now, that\u2019s what we are building and to why we are lowering is that we would expect it hopefully after election and looking all those other components, we will see a little bit more normalcy, probably not as high, obviously as what it used to be, but we think we will get back into that 7% to 9% range. If that adjusts much differently than that, then we will have other updates after that. But right now, that\u2019s what we are expecting. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey. Good morning guys and I appreciate you taking the questions. George Barrett : Thank you. George Hill : I guess Mike first off, if we think about the change in the guidance on the generic side, are you able to quantify I guess kind of from down mid-single digits to mid to high single-digits, how much of that change is due to the underlying pricing environment of the drugs themselves, the deflationary environment versus how much of that is the sell side margin pressure. And then my second question would be you started to run down the rabbit hole of purchasing compliance a little bit, I guess could you talk about what you are seeing in the contracting environment and how that help \u2013 how pricing is leading into \u2013 how pricing is tying into the purchasing compliance discussion? George Barrett : Yes. So as far as the adjustment from mid singles to mid singles to mid to high single-digits net deflation, really that entire adjustment is due to what we are seeing in the generic pricing environment. As I have mentioned, we are not really seeing the inflation-deflation piece to be significantly different than what we modeled. So you can assume all of that is essentially related to the generic pricing. And then as far as... George Hill : The sell side part? George Barrett : The sell side part, that\u2019s right. And as far as compliance goes, that\u2019s highly contract dependent, when we have customers, we are very diligent about the way we write our contracts. So if we have a customer contract that says that they have got to buy x percent of the generics from us, then we monitor that and we make sure that they do. And on the piece that they don\u2019t have to directly buy from us in order to make that deal work, they can shop that piece and we have always known that. And so that\u2019s the component that we would see, obviously some more pricing pressure on. George Hill : Okay. And maybe if I could just still a real quick follow-up for George, when we talk about this increase in the sell side competitive environment, I guess how far off the normal are we if you think about historical spikes and when we have seen heightened competition? George Barrett : I don\u2019t think I am able to give you a specific number here. What I can say is the kind of erosion that we have seen typically and it\u2019s been relatively predictable, has just been different over these last couple of months. And so it is different and noteworthy and I think is the largest component as to why we are adjusting our model for the year. The branded part, as Mike said, is much smaller. But I can\u2019t quantify that for you, George, but it is noticeably different. George Hill : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny : Good morning guys and thanks for the details so far. George Barrett : Good morning, Mike. Michael Cherny : So I think those pharma questions have been kind of be in the desk, so all these facts got on the Medical side, you guys talked a little bit about the recent share gains you have, obviously Kaiser is a very notable contract win, can you maybe talk, especially with Cordis anniversary over the last year, as you think about now your go-to-market strategy versus maybe 2 years ago, what are the biggest differences, obviously Cordis is one component, but in terms of being able to gain a competitive scale, what\u2019s changed the most or at least most improved your competitive win rate? George Barrett : Michael, thank you for the question. So, you are making Don happy on a question about Medical. So let me just give you a perspective. Our go-to-market model over recent years has really been focused broadly on a couple of really important changes. A lot of our customers are getting much more complex. They are bigger systems. So what historically might have been a single hospital is now a academic medical center plus some community hospitals, plus a few surgery centers and oncology clinics and now some doctors offices. That requires a different partner. I think our ability \u2013 and we have seen this. We have built our business around that expectation. And I think what\u2019s happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways or systems the are much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that\u2019s more broadly at the system level. I think that\u2019s playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we have been growing, I think is largely that we are positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look and I think that\u2019s been beneficial to us. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that is I think a part of that growth is the really measured and smart approach I think we have taken to expanding our portfolio in the medical segment. And so our reps are able to leverage a lot more products in the bag. And so when we call on a customer, we have more to sell them, we can leverage our expense structure, we can be more meaningful to them. And I think it would be \u2013 I don\u2019t think we should also ignore the fact that we have given a lot of energy to the Cordis business. So, we have put some great people in charge there. It\u2019s a business that we are paying a lot of attention to. Don himself has a lot of experience in this area as David Wilson who is running it. And so I think there is a lot to be said for when you have people that are excited know you are investing in the business, really are committed to that and we have hired some great people. I think that\u2019s driving some of the things we are seeing in Cordis, too. George Barrett : If I could I just want to add one more piece, because we are talking primarily in this context about the medical, but it does connect our pharmaceutical business and our medical business and many of these customers are part of that overall offering. So, I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to share that. Michael Cherny : Thanks, guys. I will let you go with rest of the queue. George Barrett : Thanks, Michael. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. David Larsen : Hi. Mike, can you talk a bit about your efforts to improve your cost structure in the corporate division? What\u2019s going to drive that? And any sort of quantification could be around that would be very helpful? Thanks. George Barrett : Yes. So, good question and I mentioned that it is a big driver when you think about that EPS bridge, as we mentioned with the generics slightly are going down and net customer activity staying the same. We needed to actually have a real focus on that expense initiative. So, a lot of us \u2013 lot of the corporate departments across the company are all located in corporate. A lot of the initiatives and things that we fund, we fund out of corporate. And so all of those things we are taking really good hard look at, making sure we are investing in the right things. We are being very targeted on those things. And just driving discipline throughout our corporate departments in all lines of our P&L to make sure that we can help contribute to offsetting some of the decline we are seeing on generics pricing. David Larsen : Okay, great. And then can you just remind me again sort of the 2Q operating income expectations for the pharma division? Pretty significant change there relative to commerce last quarter, just could you remind me what\u2019s driving that? And then what\u2019s going to sort of cause the reacceleration in growth in the back half of the year? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. So, Q2 was really being driven by the same trends that we discussed. When we take a look at that, the trends that we saw in Q1 related again to generic pricing as well as branded inflation rates being lower than we had anticipated are the two key drivers in Q2 and why we gave you some early information that it would be similar to the percentage decline we saw in Q1. As far as what\u2019s going on back half weighted, some of it has to just do with comps and things that are going to happen in the Cordis, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we are working on that we believe will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn\u2019t impact our Q2 and Q3 this year. Plus, we will have a full year of growing and getting after that business as well as on-boarding some other customers. So, we think we have enough initiatives in the back half to be able to get us to where we need to for the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Bob Willoughby : Good morning, George and Mike. While we know absolutely no one speculates on inflation anymore, it did appear your competitor bought some inventory in the inflationary market last year, liquidated this year. You bought less year-over-year, maybe the medical skews that somewhat. But isn\u2019t it safe to assume there are some pocket of profits that have fallen out of the model here year-over-year? George Barrett : Well, I think in the sense of \u2013 if we are relating it specifically to branded manufacturing, when you do have less branded manufacturer inflation, you do as I have mentioned a couple of times, when that happens quickly, you have those immediate adjustments where that 15% of your portfolio that is dependent upon that inflation sees less inflation. So, you do have to go through and renegotiate your agreements with manufacturers, but \u2013 so, that\u2019s the first important piece. As I mentioned, we are doing that with manufacturers. Any time you see a sudden change, you have to go do that. As far as specking on generics or on brand, again, that was something that we could do a long time ago, several years ago because of the nature of our relationships with generic manufacturers, on the \u2013 with Red Oak as well as our agreements on the branded side specking is minimal to almost none of an impact. Bob Willoughby : And Mike, can you reaffirm a cash flow target for the year or is that not to call today? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. We don\u2019t as you know give cash flow targets for the year, but again, there was nothing I would say that when I look at what\u2019s going on in our business that would make me think that we are not going to be able to deliver strong cash flow this year. Bob Willoughby : Thank you. George Barrett : Thanks Bob. Operator : And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. John Kreger : Hi, thanks very much. Could you give us an update on what\u2019s sort of brand inflation you are seeing within the specialty bucket and what sort of assumption you are making in guidance for that category? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. We don\u2019t break that out specifically. Generally, inflation on specialty tends to be a little bit lower, because they are higher priced items than in the overall bucket. But our overall 7% to 9% target is across the board for all branded pharmaceuticals, including specialty and what\u2019s going through our normal Pharmaceutical Distribution bucket. John Kreger : Thanks Mike. And one other one on the medical front, can you give us a sense about what your organic revenue growth was in the quarter? Now that you are lapping quarters, we are thinking about 6%, is that about right? Mike Kaufmann : I can\u2019t give you the exact number, but I would definitely tell you that we were positive growth in the medical segment without Cordis. We do still expect Cordis to deliver $0.15 for FY \u201817. And so yes, if you were to back Cordis out, you would still see nice growth, a healthy growth in the medical segment. John Kreger : Great, thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Just one more here on the sell side customer pricing, I guess I am just curious, is there any evidence that a change in the actual price methodology in the market being offered by some wholesalers? And the reason why I ask was that there was some chatter about maybe a shift to a cost plus pricing model on generics as opposed to just random spot pricing? Thanks. George Barrett : Mike? Mike Kaufmann : Well, I think all the time people are always trying to be creative on how they price and how to work with customers and different customers have different needs. So, I don\u2019t see a wholesale change though in the way people are pricing in the market. The majority of the areas where we are seeing the pricing pressure just in that normal day-to-day pricing, whether or not that\u2019s changing our larger deals, it\u2019s hard for me to speak to our competitors on how they might be doing that. And deals can get often very complicated on how you compare one to another, but I wouldn\u2019t notice any notable change at this point in time. Steven Valiquette : Okay, great. Okay, thanks. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George Barrett : Well, at first, thanks to all of you for your good questions and for joining us today. I know that we will be seeing many of you in the coming weeks and we look forward to that. And with that, we will close the call. Thank you, all. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. As I typically do, I'll spend a few minutes of my discussion covering at a high level our performance for the quarter. However, these are not typical times and, on the surface, not a typical year for Cardinal Health. The impact of this year's generic pricing environment accounts for the primary headwind on our financials. It is masking the fact that we are seeing growth in more key initiatives and priorities than we've seen in quite some time. In that context, I want to make sure that woven throughout my comments we address the following three questions. One, how are we executing and competing in the market; two, how would I characterize some of the more recent market dynamics; and three, how are we positioned for long-term sustainable growth? Before I get to that, I want to acknowledge that in spite of the extraordinary dynamism in the industry, we at Cardinal Health remain focused on the millions of people that we touch every day. We embrace our vital role at the center of the healthcare continuum, and our responsibility remains unchanged. Our role, providing the highest quality products and services to all of our partners and their patients around the world, lies at the core of who we are and what we do. Because the healthcare discussion in the U.S. has been so prominent, my commentary today will be more focused on the U.S. So how did we do this quarter? To summarize the performance for Q2, the revenue was up 5% versus the prior year to $33.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 3% to $1.34 versus the prior year. And non-GAAP operating earnings were down 4% versus the second quarter of last year to $701 million. At the segment level, our Pharmaceutical segment performed a bit better than we had expected this quarter. Revenue was up 5% versus the prior year to $29.7 billion, and segment profit declined 14% versus the prior year to $537 million. This decline was almost entirely the result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and the loss of Safeway, both of which we covered in our last call. Our Medical segment had another strong quarter, continuing its repositioning to better serve the needs of its evolving market. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 8% versus the prior year to $3.4 billion, and segment profit was up 50% versus the prior year. I would note here about half of this is attributable to the mechanics of last year's inventory step-up. These are really strong numbers. As you know, our guidance for the year, which we provided in early August, was based on both our plans for the upcoming year, as well as our assessment of market conditions at the time. By the time we reported our first quarter, we'd seen a step-down in generic pricing which prompted us to make a small change to our guidance for the year to reflect that dynamic. At the time, Mike also provided you with the key factors which could dictate where we might fall in that range. With actual data from Q2 and preliminary data from January, we can now forecast that the top end of that range is unlikely. This is more a function of the math, rather than any further deterioration of market conditions. With that in mind and wanting to provide enough of a range to account for the normal variables, we're adjusting our guidance range for FY 2017 to $5.35 to $5.50, from our prior range of $5.40 to $5.60. Mike will provide some additional color on how the various factors were included in this decision. Across the board, Cardinal Health is seeing the results of our team's dedication to addressing the needs of our customers and the people they treat every day. This team's hard work is evident as our lines of business are showing strong fundamentals. Unit sales are strong. Our customer service levels have never been higher. And our ability to operate across the continuum of care with a broad range of products and services creates a uniqueness to our model, which is resonating with our customers across the enterprise. Our rates of customer retention are extraordinarily high and we are growing with our customers, building on a sustainable value proposition that aligns with long-term trends. We are confident that we can improve efficiency for virtually any part of our customer base, and do so with a valuable and integrated portfolio. At a time of rapid change, we know how essential it is to demonstrate customer intimacy in ways that meet their specific needs and enable them to adapt to a shifting landscape. I've had the chance in recent weeks to meet with many of our customers, both upstream and downstream; and I came away from those conversations with the clear sense that they are eager to work closely with us. Together, we are better equipped to address the complexities of the system, with Cardinal Health well-positioned as a partner. Reinforced through these conversations, I'd like to focus on five major initiatives which should be familiar for you. They are : one, growing our generics program; two, driving growth in our Specialty Solutions group; three, increasing our offerings of valuable products and services to our acute and integrated delivery customers; four, driving additional penetration of Cardinal Health consumable Medical products and physician preference items; and five, establishing a leading position in the post-acute space. Let me walk through these one by one. On generics, as I said, industry pricing dynamics were challenging throughout the first half of our fiscal 2017. We are, however, seeing some signs of a return back to more typical patterns. While it may be too early to characterize this as a trend, we see it as encouraging. Our customer base is solid, and we continue to offer tremendous value for any retail or institutional customer looking to offer an industry-leading generics program. Our team's innovative approach to generics serves our customers well; and our joint venture with CVS Health, Red Oak continues to be a driver of value and, in our view, a unique source of competitive advantage. Turning to Specialty Solutions, our group continues its high rate of growth, increasing our reach across key therapeutic areas and strengthening our suite of services that we can offer our pharmaceutical partners who seek to get closer to the patients. We've more than doubled the number of clients in our Specialty hub and significantly grown the client base in our 3PL business. We are beginning to see the first wave of biosimilars entering the market. We've built the right therapeutic footprint to effectively serve any part of this system with these products, and have the team of experts in place to support this business. With regard to our acute and integrated delivery customers, these providers of healthcare are experiencing significant changes : changes in the size and complexity of their systems; the new technologies which they employ; the shifting sites of care; the adoption of more integrated delivery models, which are directed towards more patient-centered value-based designs; and the accompanying evolution of payment systems, which align with that value-based model. As their partners, we've built a suite of products and services that are designed to address these forces. Let me give you some examples. We offer critical supply chain and inventory management solutions that allow clinicians to focus on their patients and remove themselves from supply chain activities and administrative documentation. Our solutions provide visibility to real-time analytics, enabling customers to make data-driven decisions around products supporting patient safety up to the point of care. This past week, we celebrated the third anniversary of our Academy for Excellence in Healthcare, kicking off our 11th cohort. This program, based on our deep expertise and operational excellence, Lean and Six Sigma techniques, has been designed to help healthcare organizations identify and solve their greatest operating challenges, ultimately driving results that can significantly reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. To-date, we've worked with 36 hospitals, training and coaching 49 teams comprised of hundreds of Medical providers, and the group has published 16 white papers. Through this work, we've helped our partners reduce readmissions, improve the discharge management process, reduce length of stay and surgical wait times and increase patient satisfaction. Our Medical/Surgical distribution business is highly efficient and growing again, and we continue to see growth in Cardinal Health Brand products, which as you know includes Cordis. We continue to grow the number of products and product categories in our Cardinal Health Brand, and now offer more than 19,000 SKUs in 110 product families. Our Cordis acquisition is largely on plan, and I'm proud of the way in which our teams have come together around the world during this first year. We feel very confident that we can add value to any system in their interventional cardiology activities. Demographics and delivery system shifts remain key drivers behind our focus on the post-acute world. We believe that patients can be treated more efficiently, more safely and with better outcomes using the right tools. In our Cardinal Health at Home business, we continue to focus on bringing Medical products to patients in their homes. And the work we're doing at naviHealth in post-acute care management and care transitions is industry-leading and growing quite dramatically. That business uses the tools and clinical data needed to create the optimal care experience for patients. In summary, our value proposition is increasingly resonating with our customer, and this includes our manufacturer partners who are also dealing with a dynamic and shifting landscape. We have a unique capacity to navigate through environmental road bumps. Our portfolio is robust, balanced and fully integrated. Our organization has critical scale, but it's still nimble enough to deal with short-term disturbances, and our team has proven their mettle. They're mission-driven and possess a clear sense of where we're going. Because of this, as an enterprise, we are positioned for sustainable and enduring value creation for our business partners and for you, our shareholders. Finally, we are an active participant in the unfolding policy discussions around healthcare. We bring to those conversations our key tenets. All people should have access to coverage for healthcare, which most experts agree requires a stable insurance system. We need to support our providers of care, most of whom recognize that healthcare can be centered more around the patient. It can be more clearly coordinated, and incentives can be designed to encourage innovation, including ways to drive the best outcomes in the most affordable and accessible way. And we know that the overwhelming power of demographics will continue to fuel demand. Those are the inescapable realities which guide our course. This commitment to our true north helps us serve our customers and the people that they treat every day. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike and get back to you during the Q&A. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. This morning, I'll start with a review of our second quarter financial performance and then provide some additional color around our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables. Starting on slide four, our second quarter fiscal results were slightly better than expected with GAAP diluted EPS at $1.02 and non-GAAP diluted EPS at $1.34; a 4% and 3% increase, respectively. Note that both the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer outstanding shares as compared to the prior year. I'll review both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated results. Revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $33.1 billion. Consolidated GAAP gross margin dollars were flat, while non-GAAP gross margin dollars were down 2% versus the same quarter in the prior year. GAAP gross margin rates were down 29 basis points for the quarter, while non-GAAP gross margin rates were down 38 basis points. The decline in rates is best described in the explanations of the Pharma and Medical segment profit rate changes, which I will cover in a few minutes. Consolidated SG&A was down by 1%. As you would expect, we continue to have a disciplined approach to managing cost while still investing in our future. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 4% versus the prior year. Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $51 million for the quarter, a moderate increase over the prior year. For the second quarter, the GAAP effective tax rate was 34% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.2%, both somewhat lower than historical norms. Both declined 3 percentage points versus the prior year, and these lower rates were primarily due to a few favorable discrete tax items. Our second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 319 million, 13 million shares fewer than the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This is the result of our share repurchases, including $350 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. We now have $443 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy. We generated $554 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.1 billion, with $552 million held outside the United States. Now, I'll move to the segment reviews. You can follow along on slides five and six. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 5% to $29.7 billion. This increase was a result of growth from existing Pharmaceutical distribution customers, as well as strong performance from the Specialty business. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 14% to $537 million. Generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, the previously announced loss of Safeway partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing drove this decrease. Note that while profits tied to branded inflation were a headwind in Q2, this headwind had a smaller impact than the loss of Safeway. Remember that less than 15% of our branded margin is tied to inflation and we continue to work with our branded partners to ensure that we receive fair value for our services. My expectation is that this contingent component will be less than 10% in the near future. Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 41 basis points to 1.8%, largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing. Last quarter, we told you we expected that generic pricing and brand inflation would cause Q2 Pharma segment profit to decline a percentage similar to Q1. While these items came in about as expected, our better-than-anticipated performance in Specialty distribution as well as SG&A contributed to the Pharma segment's better-than-expected results. The excellent performance in Specialty was driven by growth in the acute space in Metro Medical on the provider facing side, and growth in our 3PL and regulatory science service offerings on the biopharma side. Now, let's go to the Medical segment which had another strong quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from net new and existing customers. Segment profit increased 50% to $159 million due to the contribution from Cardinal Health Brand products which includes Cordis. This increase reflects the $21 million unfavorable impact of the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Excluding this step-up, year-over-year Medical segment profit growth was a robust 25%. Please remember that in the Q3 comparison, we will have the same $21 inventory step-up from fiscal year 2016. Segment profit margin rate increased 132 basis points to 4.68% due to the Cardinal Health Brand products which, as noted above, includes Cordis. Overall, the Medical segment team is working well together to drive results. My comments until now have been largely U.S.-focused, so I want to highlight two global items. First, Cordis is performing well, particularly in Europe and Latin America. And second, the China team continues to execute well, and they're on track to achieve double-digit top and bottom line growth for the full fiscal year. On a related note, during the quarter, we didn't see much of an impact resulting from foreign exchange or commodities. Before I discuss our outlook for the full year, you can turn to slide number seven to see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS result was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs. Let me move to our fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions on slides nine through 12. As George mentioned earlier, with six months of data behind us and a good view into January, we believe achieving the upper half of our $5.40 to $5.60 guidance range will be challenging. So to adjust for this and provide some room for variability, we are modifying our guidance range to $5.35 to $5.50. To be specific, the most significant parts for the second half are mainly environmental. They're generic market pricing, taxes and brand inflation. So all this translates to a non-GAAP EPS growth rate of between 2% and 5% for the fiscal year, a minor adjustment from our prior guidance. With that context as a backdrop, I'll walk through our updated corporate assumptions on slide 10. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 320 million and 321 million shares. Additionally, our updated assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $384 million or $0.77 per share, which does not affect our non-GAAP earnings. As you can see, all of our other corporate assumptions remain unchanged. On slide 11, there are two updates to our full-year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. First, based on our six months of data plus a good view into January, we are updating our generic drug price assumption from mid to high-single digit deflation to high-single digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Second, our Q1 assumptions expected Pharma segment profit for FY 2017 to be down mid to high-single digits versus the prior year. Based on the factors I discussed earlier, we now expect full-year Pharma segment profit to be down high-single to low-double digits. All other Pharma segment assumptions are unchanged. Now turning to the Medical segment assumptions on slide 12. We are on track to achieve mid to high-single digit percentage growth in revenue, up from our previous assumption of mid-single digit percentage revenue growth. All of our other Medical segment assumptions are unchanged, and we expect to see double-digit profit growth versus the prior year for the segment. One final comment. As you can see, based upon our first half performance and updated total year guidance, we expect our second half to be somewhat better than our first half with Q3 slightly larger than Q4. Overall, we believe that we're well-positioned to manage the changing healthcare landscape with a clear, well-defined strategy across the enterprise. The vast majority of our businesses and initiatives are going very well, and we know our key priorities and how to get after them. With that, operator, let's go to the questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning, and thank you for all the details. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Good morning. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just to follow up on how we should think about the update to guidance and kind of when we think about the different factors that are getting worse in the second half, are these things that you think are going to be isolated to, one, the third or fourth quarter? Or should we expect some of these headwinds to persist throughout the year? And basically, what I'm trying to get is kind of will some of these things carryover or flow through to fiscal year 2018? How should we think about that? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Ricky, good morning. It's George. I'll start and then I'll let Mike pick up. Again, it's important, in my commentary I made the observation that actually we're not seeing a further deterioration. That, in fact, as we started to come to the very end of our Q2, we started to see more normal patterns on generics. So largely \u2013 and I'll let Mike touch on this \u2013 the base is sort of reset lower. But, Mike, do you want to add to that? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would just emphasize, Ricky, as I look across all of our businesses and all of the various factors that contribute to our overall results, I would emphasize that as we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, it's really this generic pharmaceutical pricing that is the number one factor. And all we're saying here is that it basically ended up finishing a little lower than we expect it to, in the sense that our base is reset a little bit lower than we expected it to, but the actual activity that we saw in December and January looks to be stabilizing, and that we've just set at a little bit lower base. And so, when we took that lower base and spread it across our second half, that's really essentially what lowered our overall guidance. So as you think about the various components, I've mentioned three things, generic pricing being the biggest factor that can have a little bit of variability to it. But again, as George mentioned and I mentioned, it's looking much better over the last couple months. Branded inflation, we did see some branded inflation in January and it seems to be about where we're expecting it to be. But again, depending on what happens over the last five months, we just want to call that out. And lastly, taxes, which I called out is the third factor. It's more about timing within quarters than overall being concerned that we're going to fall outside our 35% to 37% guidance range. It's really that you might see it be a little better in one quarter and a little worse in the other. But overall for the year, we expect it to be... George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Right. Ricky, my comments were specifically about the generic environment, which is what I thought you were asking about. But I think Mike captured the more broad perspective on this. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And I would emphasize, I think, it's really just a slight EPS reduction because of, again, this variability in the generic market pricing. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And just to clarify on the generic pricing and deflation. I know last quarter you mentioned that generic deflation is also a mix, right, so it's the sell-side versus buy-side. So should we read into your comments that you've seen both the sell-side and buy-side environment stabilizing by December? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would say the answer is yes. As far as price activity from manufacturers to us, that's been tracking all year about as what we expected. It was really the sell-side that started out for the first couple quarters lower than we had originally anticipated. But, again, we see it stabilizing now. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Ricky. Operator : And we'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Can I just start and just follow-up there just so that I understand this, George? When you talk about it stabilizing, but yet we think about the fact that you're lowering the back half of the year. I guess, I'm just trying to understand that math. How that works. So if it stabilized in the most recent quarter and SG&A and Specialty drove a little bit of better upside, was it just that your anticipation was that things were going to get better in your fiscal back half of the year and now they're somewhat carrying through, although they've stabilized? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. That's a fair question, Lisa. I would say that's pretty much accurate. I'd say that where it's stabilized at, we're just a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated when we projected our second half. And so, that even though Specialty is over-performing and we're seeing some really good controls in SG&A, that when you mix the two together that it net was a little bit potentially lower for us. And then, we just wanted to give ourselves a little bit of variability. When we first thought about taking off the top half of the range and having just a $0.10 range, that seemed a little tight for us only halfway through the year. And so, we thought that adding another $0.05 to give us a little bit of room would be the smart thing to do. Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Mike, you also made a comment about Q3 being better than Q4. Can you just talk about is there something specific that you're anticipating in either side of your business in Q3, or was that comment specific to drug distribution? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No. That was just specific overall, just to try to be helpful. Obviously, you'll be able to estimate we think the second half will be, and then I just wanted to give you a little thought that Q3 would be bigger than Q4 mainly because that's the quarter where you see the majority of the branded inflation. Anyways, as you know, that's typically the quarter where you see it. And so, I thought you guys are all going to be thinking Q3 is bigger than Q4 generally because it historically always is. But I just wanted to give you little thoughts around that it should be about slightly bigger than Q4, to give you a little help. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Lisa. Operator : The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, guys. George, appreciate the commentary. Obviously, it's a tough environment for all of us to kind of navigate. And amongst your peers, the commentary regarding the outlook has been slightly different in terms of various drivers. I guess, from your standpoint, what do you think are the one or two things we need to be spending the most time thinking about as we analyze and grade how this business is doing given all these macro factors? And, obviously, you feel as if the underlying was better than sort of what the guidance or the quarter showed. And so, help us think through what sort of KPIs you're looking at or how you're thinking about the evolution relative to kind of how the last 12 months played out? Because it's obviously been a pretty volatile environment relative to what this business has been used to. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Ross. Yes, let me try to do this, and then I'll comment a little bit on the unique dynamic of having some of our peers report with actually different year ends. And Mike will touch on that because I actually think it's an interesting dynamic at work. For us, the drivers \u2013 we know that economically, as we've said, that the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment is a big factor. We'll watch to see, for us, that those rates look more normalized. We started to see that towards the end of the quarter and the beginning of January. Obviously, as I said, it's a little early to declare trend, but I thought that was an encouraging sign. It's something that I said to you guys I thought would start to happen. The other thing is all of our priorities have to be going in the right direction. Specialty; our Specialty business is in a really good position right now. We've seen really good signs of growth broadly, both downstream and upstream. Across our Medical segment, we're seeing really encouraging signs, even in what you think of as our legacy Medical/Surgical business is really beginning to get a little bit of wind in their sales. So watching for all the components, our service lines in Medical, our Cardinal Health branded products, our work in naviHealth, our activity with our Med/Surg products. These are all, for us, key indicators of our long-term positioning playing out the way we want and, actually, the general growth in customer base. We want customers to see us as that go-to company at a time of complexity. So we're beginning to see that. And so, actually, we're feeling quite optimistic about where we are, we're having to navigate, and have had to navigate through a little bit of a tough environment in generics. But as we've said to you that happens from time to time and we're keeping disciplined about how we see the future of the business. Anything to add there, Mike? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think the only thing I would add is, as you mentioned, generic pharmaceutical pricing is a key driver, and I think the timing of the three distributors' year ends is an important factor to consider. When you think that what we really saw, the impact of that was really in our Q1 and if our \u2013 I'll just put it simply, if our year-end had been three months later, we probably wouldn't be revising guidance because we would've had some insight and built that into the year. If our year-end had been three months earlier, we probably would've had a bigger miss because we would've had even less insight into it. So it's difficult to compare when you have three different year ends. Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. And obviously, George, you talked about just in terms of key priorities. On the Medical business, the growth there has been obviously quite good. You've gained some share, you've executed on the deals. The balance sheet still has some capability. And in terms of adding incremental assets to the mix and continuing to evolve that strategy, where are you in terms of appetite for having digested Cordis, contemplating whether or not it makes sense to add more into the bag there in Medical? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I'll just do this very generally and probably consistent with the comments we've made in the past. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our business organically and certainly through the strength of our balance sheet. And so, to the extent that we see opportunities to grow capabilities that we think have sustainable competitive advantage, position us for this continually evolving market, we will not be shy to look at those opportunities. But, again, hopefully you'll expect from us discipline in doing that. But certainly a part of the equation for us is how we use our balance sheet, and that may be through activities that are available external to us and the other ways that we deploy capital. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I think I like to maybe split hairs a little bit on the drug pricing conversation. So I heard you loud and clear on the impact to this quarter from generic drug pricing assumptions moving to high-single digit deflation. I want to make sure I understand perfectly that commentary relative to competition in the marketplace and your view. Did that competition element impact the change in guidance, or are we really focused on the element and the assumption that you focused on? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Well, I think one feeds the other. The competitiveness in the generic market is what drove the revision to the generics being down net high-single digit deflation for the year, because it's made up of two key components : pricing from the manufacturers, which we said we haven't seen really much variability from what we expected for the year; and then our pricing downstream to the customers. The combination of those two drive that factor. And so, since we've seen, like we said, more aggressive pricing in the market early on in the year \u2013 although again we've seen some positive signs lately \u2013 that is what drove that number to be down high-single digits. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Now, I get it relative to the manufacturer expectations. That's helpful. And then, your comment on Q3 versus Q4, Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: We've been trying to understand the ramp through the year. Should I expect that we're still down high-single digits in Q3, but then potentially up as we get to Q4 and you lap some of the headwinds? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: As far as actually giving growth percentages, I don't want to necessarily step right into that, but I do think that \u2013 again, just trying to be helpful. If you take what you obviously think the guidance for the year is and take a look at the second half, we just want to give you a little bit of color that Q3 would be slightly larger than Q4. Operator : The next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. Just following up, Mike, on the back half commentary. Seeing some of the key metrics stabilizing as you move into the back half, other than maybe some residual impact from something like Safeway, do you feel that the back half as you look at it today is more representative of the new world order? Is this how we should think about how the business can perform in this environment as you think about, obviously, a little bit of a difference between 3Q and 4Q. But taken together is that how you envision the business performing going forward? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Generally, probably, overall that's not a bad assumption. Again, we have to think through all the pieces and how it relates over a full year because you've got comps and stuff through the prior year. But if you think about certain things like if the generic market has stabilized \u2013 which again we say early results we've seen \u2013 will lap Safeway in the fourth quarter, then you have the $21 million step-up in Q3 that completely goes away. So you do have some large moving parts that kind of settle out during the year, but you're going to continue to have positives like Red Oak and some of the other initiatives that we're driving that continue to be tailwinds for us. But, yeah, a lot of those things that have created some noise in the P&L should either be stabilizing or we should be lapping. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And I know we spend a lot of time on the generic pricing side, but just can you remind us on the branded side what's factored in for the year? I guess, specifically, is there another assumption in your fiscal 4Q that you would see another round of more significant branded price increases? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question. It's hard to know whether or not we'll see another set of increases or what they'll be for the rest of the year, but we still believe that our estimate of 7% to 9% for the full fiscal year is approximately the right number to be at. Again, that's a range that \u2013 obviously, there's some variability into that. So we're trying to take into account all of those factors as to whether or not there should be. I would also mention that, again, most of the price increases in the second half do happen in January. So we have seen a lot of it. So the amount of it in the second half that's left to go is not necessarily huge. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And I think the other thing, again, just as a moving part, movement here is not as relevant economically as what we were describing in generic. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Operator : And we'll take a question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike and George, I'd ask what type of insights is Red Oak giving you in the ability to kind of forecast generic drug pricing? And does Red Oak provide you any protection from downward price activity that might differentiate you from your peers? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: George, okay, I'll start with that and then Mike. So on the buying side, remember there's two components to this. There's the buy and the sell. Red Oak, I think we've got really sophisticated analytics and capabilities and just great dialogue with our manufacture partners. So as much as you can, obviously, these are products that, as you know, change frequently in the generic world. But I would say we've got pretty good line of sight and really good analytics and great teams. The sell-side is a different story. And so, Mike, thoughts on that? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say, I guess, the first comment again kind of emphasizing what George said on Red Oak, right, the ultimate \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 game in generics is while you can have a deflating sell price, but if you're managing your costs better you can always be expanding your margins. And so, if you're asking me do I think we're in a great position with Red Oak. Absolutely, based on what George said. I have a ton of faith in the team, the analytics. The fact that we are the largest in that standpoint I feel really good about that. As far as Red Oak, working together with the sell-side, there's actually no cutover. Red Oak doesn't do anything or have anything to do with what our sell price should be. Their goal is to ultimately go out and get us the best absolute cost. And then, we actually have a firewall between the two, because I think it's incredibly important that our selling side folks aren't actually seeing the cost of our generics because I don't what that to influence how they decide to price. We want the price to market and we want to make sure we're overall evaluating our overall selling proposition. So we actually have a very strong firewall between our sell-side decisions and our costing decisions with Red Oak. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: What I would add to this, George, is that I do think our telemarketing operations give us, on the sell-side, probably a very nice line of sight because we're having so much daily dialogue with the pharmacy world. So, I think, as good a line of sight as we can. But, as you know, this year has been a little bit more difficult to model than past years, but we're a little bit encouraged by the more recent signs. George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, maybe a quick follow-up might just be your largest customer seems poised for some market share losses. I know for you guys that's largely brand business. Is there any impact to kind of market share shifts on the retail end factored into the guidance or is it immaterial? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. We knew about all of that in the past, as we mentioned before. All of that was factored into our guidance. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : And the next question is from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: (43:47). Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. So just on the generics, on the signs of returning back to more normal typical pricing patterns, just curious to get more color on what you think are the drivers of the slightly improving generic deflation rate? You don't have to throw things out there. I'm just curious, are you seeing maybe just some price increase activity to offset price erosion on others? Is it just anniversarying tougher comps? Just wanted to get more color on what you're seeing that's leading to the better trend? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Steve, I'll do the best I can on this because these are complex markets. I would say, in general, we saw what we thought to be a pretty unusual flurry of activity in the early part of our fiscal year. And our expectation, just based on sort of history, was we see those things from time to time and they tend to stabilize and revert back to more normal patterns if you don't see significant movement of share. And I would say that's probably what we saw. So what happened during a period of time was that the steepness of the curve was sharper. It was a more steep downward curve. There's always erosion on the sell price. That's sort of the normal pattern. But the rate, the steepness of that curve was a little heightened. And our feeling was that what we might see and we expected to see was a bit of a calming down of that at some point. And I think that's largely as best as we can describe that dynamic. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just quickly on the brand side. You mentioned that 15% of the profits may be tied to brand inflation. For whatever reason, it seems like investors have a higher-than-normal amount of focus on the upcoming midyear round of brand price increases for the industry. And my sense, kind of as you touched down a little bit earlier, it's just not that critical to the overall earnings picture really in any year. So I'm just wondering is there any breakdown of how much of that 15% of those economics occurs around the January round of branded inflation versus the midyear round. I'm guessing the overwhelming majority is tied to the January round? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. When you take a look at the historical patterns and even so far what we seen this year, is the branded price increases are heavily more weighted to the January timeframe than any other time. Probably that mid-summer timeframe is the second largest, but it's by far larger in the January timeframe. And again, to emphasize, if I had to talk about the three variables, I would rank them in order of generics by far being the largest, and then the taxes only because of its variability between quarters, and then brand being the smallest of the three at least for our mix of products and what we're expecting. Operator : The next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey. Thanks for taking the question. George and Mike, if we go back to the Dublin day in December, you had talked about the competitive environment on the sell-side highlighting your independent book. And, George, if I recall you made a comment saying that you had factored in sort of the competitive sort of step-down in the pricing into your guidance here. So then when I think about your comments today, are you saying that we continue to see more competitive price erosion? Or was it your assumptions on what you needed to give in terms of maintaining your book had changed? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Charles. Good morning. So, I think largely what we're saying is that as we came to the tail end of Q2, we started to see more typical rates of erosion in comparison to what we had seen in the early fall, which was more sharp. So actually, again, we're being a little bit cautious here because \u2013 I wish I had more data to say this is a discernible trend. But I would say it's a good sign that we did see some stabilization to the more normalized rates. Mike, could you add to it (47:36)? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I'd just again emphasize that at the time in December we didn't have quite as much information as we did by the end, and bottom line is it just settled out a little lower than we expected it to across all of the channels where we sell generics. But the good news is, it seems to have stabilized at that lower level and we just needed to update where we were for the rest of the year. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then, as a follow-up, you mentioned earlier you expect the component of your fee-for-service, that's contingent to be less than 10%. I missed the timeframe that you expect that to happen. Is that sort of as we get into fiscal 2018, or is that a contracting cycle over the next few years? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that it would be more of a next 12 months type of a thing. Right now, it's less than $0.15. I would expect it to get to that $0.10 range within the next 12 months. Operator : The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. Thanks for taking the question. So you noted strong growth in your Specialty business this quarter. So could you touch on how your discussions with specialty drug manufacturers are going? And then, how quickly is your Specialty distribution business growing compared to the hub services piece? And how confident are you that growth in Specialty over the long-run won't cause some downward pressure on margins? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. So there were a couple of parts to that question, Jon. I just want to make sure I got them right. One is, I think you're saying what's driving it, if I got it right. Again, there's multiple components. What's driving it? Do we see it as sustainable? And the impact to margin rates? So let me start with the basics. I think we're driving it and have been very consistently been driving growth in two primary areas. One is our reach across therapeutic areas has just become dramatically larger over these last three to four years. So we were present in certain areas in the institution and then we started to grow our oncology businesses. We've expanded into urology and rheumatology. And so, I would say our overall footprint downstream in therapeutic areas right now is very strong, and that just makes us a stronger partner for anyone. On the upstream, I think we've started to build more tools and capabilities for the manufacturer partners and, in particular, I'd highlight our patient hub. And this is a time where manufacturers really want to connect with their patients and I think our hub allows us to do that. So we do see continued progress in our Specialty business. As it relates to margin rates, we don't break out the specific margin rates in Specialty versus sort of traditional Pharma. Having said that, we don't see the Specialty as being dilutive to it. And, again, Mike, I'll ask you to just qualify anything I (50:35). Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Just a couple of quick comments. I would say, if you think about Specialty, just separate it in two different businesses \u2013 services upside, the biopharma downstream to the providers \u2013 both are growing significantly. On the downstream side, although we've lapped the Metro Medical acquisition, it continues to perform very well in some of the areas where we weren't as strong before the acquisition. For instance, we were strong in oncology. They were very strong in rheumatology and nephrology, and those areas continue to go very well for us. And the team down there executes very well. So we're seeing very strong growth downstream on the provider side. That's going to be our more lower-margin typical distribution type of margin business. And then, upside on the biopharma side, the strong areas have really been our hub, our 3PL business and our scientific and regulatory businesses are all doing very nicely. And these are going to be much higher-margin services businesses. So when you blend it together, it makes for a nice mix for us. Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Jon. Operator : Next is David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Congratulations on a good quarter. Mike, can you talk about the \u2013 yeah, very good quarter on both divisions \u2013 can you talk about your SG&A costs? I mean, those looked like the lowest percentage of revenue that I've seen in four years. Are there any focused efforts going on at Cardinal to maybe reduce costs? Can you talk about that, please? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Sure. As you can imagine, any time when you're not performing at the level that you would expect yourself and hold yourself accountable to delivering, you're going to get after managing your expenses maybe even tighter than you normally would. And so, I think that both the Pharma and the Med team, even though the Med team's performing very strongly, they're also paying attention to their expenses too, because we're all one company. We're all Cardinal. But the Pharma side is just being very thoughtful about where they're making investments, trying to prioritize; and I do want to emphasize, we're still making investments. It's important to know that while we're paying attention to our SG&A, we're also at the same time prioritizing things that are still important to our future and investing in those. So I would say it's really about tight focus, prioritization and just managing through those types of things. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then on the Medical side, if Don is here, maybe he can comment on the margins? And is this a good sort of go-forward run rate? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're going to continue to see some fluctuation in our margin rates in Medical, but I do think that you're now starting to see a margin rate where we would expect it to be. As you said, we've never given up on our goal to be at 5.75%, both through our organic growth and inorganic moves that we'll continue to make. I think that you're going to see big wins like Kaiser, that we talked about, while that's a distribution customer, it's going to be margin dilutive because it's more margin. It's more of a distribution business. And then, you're going to see adding businesses like Cordis, which are going to be higher margin. Then you're going to see us convert our customers to more Cardinal Health Brand products, which is going to increase our margin rates, grow our at Home business, which is growing our margin rates as well as naviHealth. So I think we have a lot of moving parts in Medical that should continue to help us with the momentum on growing our margin rates on that side of the business. Operator : The next question is from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Just quickly, Mike, one for you. Just a more technical question than anything else. It looks like just from your updated share count assumptions that we're pretty much assuming no real incremental buyback based on current levels of the back half of the year? Is that how you guys think about it and then to be opportunistic if you see fit? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Mike, you said it about perfectly. Yeah, we're not anticipating any more stock repurchases in the second half. However, if there is an opportunity and depending on where our cash sits, we may opportunistically do that. But right now, we're not planning to do that at this point. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Must be the patriots' blood in me. And then, George, one... George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Don't encourage, Sally. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Okay. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : George, one just big picture question for you, particularly as you move into your role as Head of Healthcare Leadership Council. So as you think about all the moving pieces in D.C. and whether it's uncertainty around stuff around tax reform, be it corporate tax reform in the U.S., border adjustability, all of the moving pieces related to the changing landscape of healthcare reform and will they, won't they on the Obamacare repeal, how do you think about positioning the business and positioning the company so that you're as nimble as possible as some of these changes come down to landscape? And is there any way you can even pre-prepare the business for something that's a moving target? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question, Mike. I appreciate it. So let me do the best I can. One of the interesting things about our business is that our fundamental strategic direction has been set really for a number of years, and we actually have a strategic plan in process that we do with 100 or so people in the organization a couple of times a year. And as it turns out, we had one just a few days after the election. And the first thing we did with the group was put out a chart in front of them and said, these are our priorities, these are the trends in healthcare. What changes? And with the exception of the fact that we're going to have to deal with some policy issues along the way, fundamentally the directions are clear. Demographics will not turn backwards. We know it's an inexorable march. We know that care is going to move to more ambulatory settings, move to different settings. We know that there's going to be a focus on efficiency and coordination of care, that the post-acute world is going to be important. So we built our strategy around those things. So it's been really interesting to try to sort of navigate the short-term stuff, but keep our eye very much on the long-term. Here's what I'd say just very, very generally about the two things you mentioned, the Affordable Care Act and the tax-related issues. The President, the majority party have made it very clear that their intentions are to repeal the Act through the budget reconciliation process. And through that, as you probably know, they can eliminate components of the law. But they've also reaffirmed their commitment to retain certain aspects of the law like the pre-existing conditions requirements. So again, these are complex moving parts. And so, the things that we're doing is making sure that there is an educator reminding people about whether we're going to replace, or rebuild, or repair, or whatever the right term is. We want to make sure that there is a stable insurance foundation to support it, and that sort of is a key opening part to it. And we think that is at this point well understood, and that the timelines are probably going to adjust a little bit as people try to figure out how to navigate that. We'll make sure our voice is heard. On the tax proposals, we generally have been a supporter, as you know, of tax reform. But again we want to make sure that we are educators and informers on certain dynamic. So, for example, you know that many Medical products including some of ours are made outside of the U.S. and related facilities. And so, we just want to make sure that that information is well understood as policies are starting to come through. So, yeah, there was interesting time both as Cardinal Health and certainly in my new role as Chair of HLC. But I think we're well-positioned broadly, and I think we're nimble enough to continue to adapt to short-term dynamics at work. Operator : The next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Medical, obviously, I think everybody is feeling a little bit better about it today. That being said, you do have a very large win with Kaiser. I'm just trying to pull back the layers of the onion here a little bit. If we could strip out Kaiser, my guess is growth looks like 3% to 4%. What is the growth in acute care stand-alone, ex-Kaiser? You've got a lot of small businesses that are growing faster, doing better. I'm just trying to make sure that the acute care distribution piece stand-alone ex-market share isn't actually flat to shrinking at this point? Or maybe it is. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. So, Eric, thanks for the question. I don't want to pull Kaiser out for two reasons. One is, I wouldn't want to talk specifically about the size of any one customer, but second of all it is part of our business, it is the result of all of the work that the team has done to reposition the business as a thought leader, as a business that has lots of other services, a broad product line. And so, to me it is more of the result of all of the work we've done, so to pull it out doesn't make sense. Now, business is still definitely growing without the Kaiser piece in it, but it's hard to break it down. I don't know that would be appropriate. George? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Eric, if it's okay, I will do this because we don't break out individual pieces, and we certainly don't want to break out individual customers. But remember I talked to you about and someone asked earlier lead indicators. So they are all looking green. Our Pharmaceutical \u2013 excuse me, our Medical/Surgical distribution business is probably the healthiest position we've seen it in quite some time. So we're seeing really a very good organic activity and growth there. So I think I can answer qualitatively without breaking out the individual pieces for you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: And if you set aside Kaiser and make it Cordis, the business (01:00:28). Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I don't want to take Kaiser away from you. I actually think you're structurally advantaged perhaps versus some in the market. I am just trying to get a sense of where the market is? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Understood. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. And I didn't mean any other way than that. But I appreciate that. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. We can take it offline. Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. Operator : The next question is from Garen Sarafian with Citi. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, George and Mike. High-level question on procurement in generics. One of your peers is in the market getting updated pricing that includes the volume of a large new retail client. So how has that impacted the market? And how long do you think whatever changes are going on take to flow through? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: That's a tough question, because I don't really want to speak for our competitors. And I'm not sure of the timing of exactly when they are launching and all the different pieces of when they go-to-market. But I will say that as you can imagine, our Red Oak team is paying attention to that, has great relationships with the manufacturers and will be paying attention to that to make sure that we are costed appropriately for our size and simplicity and transparency of our model. And other than that, that's probably all I can say. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, if there's anything on \u2013 how long, in generic terms when there's a large new client, it takes to flow through the system? But the follow-up was actually going to be, to close out a prior question, on the impact of branding price increases and impact to Cardinal. So could you put some sort of any broad weightings around the impact of January price increases versus the midyear? Is it more of two-thirds, one-third? Or is it more 80/20? Or something else that you could share? Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I probably can't share that level of detail because it's obviously hard to know, and manufacturers moved slightly between month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So again I'll just emphasize January is bigger, the biggest month, but other than that, George? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Garen, I'd just add to this? I mean, typically January is bigger, as Mike said. The other thing that we need to note is, it's been an unusual stretch for some time. And so, again, predicting exact ramp behavior is always a little bit tricky. As you know, years ago it was very, very systematic, and today it's a little bit more one-offs. But I think that January typically is a bigger month, but I think we have to recognize that things are little bit different and maybe not as predictable in terms of exactly when things occur as they might've been five years ago? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And to answer your other question around generics and being able to execute on that, I think that just depends very differently on how you go to market, the size of that customer, whether it even deserves a repricing, and then how you go about that, how your relationships are with the manufacturer. So I think that can vary drastically and dramatically between different players in the marketplace. I know we feel really good about when we combined how quickly we executed, but I'm not sure I can say that anybody else would go faster or slower than us. Operator : The final question will come from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Hey. Thanks, guys. And I hate to ask this at the very end of the call, George, but \u2013 and by the way I very much enjoyed the white paper on DIRs and that just was issued, what, last month? But from the standpoint of your ability to defend or protect end of tenant pharmacies and obviously maintain, maybe even gain, market share in the independent pharmacy space as it relates to DIRs. Where do you guys sit in the spectrum? Because it does feel like this is obviously \u2013 these revelations that we're starting to see on DIRs. I mean it's a very painful experience for your Pharmacy customers. And I just wanted to kind of see how you guys could possibly or how you are potentially defending them, protecting them, when they are obviously experiencing these pretty massive decremental margins 90, 120 days after the fact. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: So there are two parts to this, so let me answer the second part first. I'm not sure there's a company more focused on the community pharmacy and pharmacy industry, in general. We believe that they're going to be a key player. As healthcare continues to evolve, we have shortages of primary care physicians. We think pharmacists will and should play a more active role. We're doing an incredible amount of work through Jon Giacomin's organization to make sure that we're close to them and providing all of the solutions and tools that can help them compete in the market, and actually help them provide cognitive care which we think is very important. Going back to your first point, I might want to make an important note about this because we've gotten a few questions. We are a player in oncology and, as such, we've been a member of Community Oncology Alliance. And as a member of that, we have funded research. But you specifically referred to a particular project. We do not direct the researchers' \u2013 the subjects. So it's just important for me to comment on that. So we've had questions about that paper. We didn't specifically fund a paper on this. We are basically part of an alliance, and that group does research. But the summary of what I'm describing is our work around community pharmacy and around pharmacy in general, is very much a part of what we do. Whether it's through generic programs, the abilities to help them tie to a hospital system or to a post-acute facility or to set up a diabetes center, we've done a huge amount of work in providing tools to help community pharmacy compete in what is for all of us an interesting and challenging environment. Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC : Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Barrett, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional remarks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Eric, and thanks all of you for your questions today. Our organization, just in summary, remains focused on execution, on driving our strategic priorities, on making sure that we are creating what I would say is, again, sustainable value creation for our partners and for patients and for you all. And we look forward to seeing you all in the near future, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

George. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's call. We had a fairly full conversation with you just two weeks ago, so my commentary this morning will be relatively brief, and I'll let Mike walk you through the numbers. The quarter came in largely as we expected. Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and our business partners, customer retention is high, and unit growth is solid. As I mentioned on a recent call, the performance in most of our lines of business is strong, and I'd like to highlight a few. Our Specialty Solutions group continues to grow at a good clip well into the double digits. Or Medical/Surgical business has been performing very well, with help coming from new customers, the strength of our consumables portfolio, and the value of our supply chain services. In addition, our naviHealth and post-acute activities are extremely attractive to a market going through significant changes, and are also growing at a pace faster than we had originally modeled. Most important, we are seeing that the value of our portfolio is fueling a more broad-based interest in Cardinal Health. With the provider system increasing in complexity, reconfiguring itself, and wrestling with new payment models, we feel confident that we can bring added efficiency, quality, and safety to virtually any system. And the value that we create in serving these providers increases our critical role in helping pharmaceutical, biotech, medical, and lab manufacturers bring their products to the patients they ultimately serve. Having said this, we have highlighted these past months, and reinforced two weeks ago, the dynamics we've been experiencing around pharmaceutical pricing, particularly in generics, and the impact it has had on our Pharmaceutical segment. There is little for me to add to my commentary from our call on April 18. In summary, we are experiencing pricing deflation in generics, some heightened reimbursement pressures which affect our customers, and a scarcity of new generic launches in the near term. It's these factors, plus some company specific discrete items, which largely informed the fiscal 2017 and early 2018 outlook we provided. One quick note about our Cordis business. We've said before that we expected our transition activities to cause some lumpiness in our Cordis numbers, which Mike will address. But overall, we were encouraged by our commercial momentum on a global basis. We've recently added some products to our bag which will offer our customers even greater value. We are building a platform off of which we can offer additional products and services globally once we fully integrate the Patient Recovery business we plan to acquire from Medtronic. I'd like to provide an additional comment specific to our recent conference call. We faced an interesting dilemma two weeks ago. We were extremely pleased to be able to bring our negotiations with Medtronic to the finish line. This is a business that has been on our radar for many years. At the same time, we began to see our early numbers for fiscal 2018 roll-off. And while we always challenge ourselves to improve our numbers as we go through our planning process, we did not want to give you the good news about the acquisition without sharing the important facts that we were seeing in the current market. This has always been our approach with you. We are an organization that will take the necessary actions to improve and adapt to set ourselves up for the long-term. Our people are competitive, focused, and committed to serving our customers and their patients. And the near-term disturbance in market conditions will not deter us from our obligation to be accountable for performance and our commitment to our customers. We will continue to invest in and drive those activities which differentiate us in the marketplace as a creator of sustainable value. It is with this in mind that I'm even more excited about the acquisition of Medtronic's Patient Recovery business. As we said two weeks ago, these product lines are natural extensions to the work that we're doing across the continuum of care; from acute care, to surgery centers, to long-term care, into the retail setting, and even to the consumer. These are product areas and channels with which we have enormous experience. I won't repeat all of the many reasons why we are thrilled about this transaction, but let me summarize by saying that the addition of these businesses increases our scale, our balance, and our relevance to all of our customers. These are products used every day in our global healthcare systems, and this acquisition will leverage all of the tools that we've built over the years to be the daily touch point to the providers of care and their patients. I'd like to make one more observation about this acquisition. Some of you have asked whether this transaction represents a departure from our Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and the answer is no. As I mentioned earlier, we've had our eye on this business for a long time, and we believe that adding these product lines to our existing portfolio will provide additional value to our customers and to you, our shareholders. Let me be clear on this. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business is an important and valued part of an integrated portfolio. While market conditions can from time to time affect any business, we are confident in the value that our best-in-class distribution business provides today and into the future. I'll finish by reiterating that our portfolio of product and service offerings is strong, valuable to our customers, and increasingly well-balanced. And we are extremely positive about the opportunities in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll walk you through the financials. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. In my comments this morning, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then, I'll review the expectations we detailed a couple of weeks ago for our full fiscal year. At this time, we don't have any updates to our FY 2018 or FY 2019 early thoughts we provided on April 18, so I won't say anything more, other than our leadership team has a strong sense of optimism and accountability. We are managing the company with discipline and for the long-term. Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP, and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion, as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables. Starting on slide 4 with our consolidated company results, our third-quarter GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.53, an increase of 3% and 7%, respectively. Note that both the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer outstanding shares as compared to the prior year. Total company revenues grew 4% versus the prior year to $31.8 billion. Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased by 2% and 1%, respectively. GAAP gross margin rates were down 8 basis points for the quarter, while non-GAAP gross margin rates were down 15 basis points, primarily due to generic pharmaceutical pricing. Consolidated company SG&A increased 5% from the prior year. Since we have lapped our significant acquisitions, the growth is mainly driven by the costs associated with our pharma IT system refresh, new Medical segment business wins, and Cordis infrastructure expense, partially offset by assumptions around incentive compensation. As you would expect, we continue to be disciplined in our expense management. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined in the quarter versus the prior year by 8% and 4%, respectively. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $41 million, a 7% decrease over the prior year. This decrease was driven by deferred compensation income, which has an equal offset in SG&A expense, so there is no net impact to EPS from this favorable variance. For the third quarter, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%, down 4.6 and 4.3 percentage points, respectively, versus the prior year. This improvement was due to a few favorable discrete items in the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 318 million, 13 million fewer shares than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and, as of the end of the quarter, had $443 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. During the quarter, we had net operating cash outflows of $198 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance, including short-term investments, of $1.6 billion, with $514 million held outside the United States. While we don't typically provide cash flow forecast or guidance, we do expect to generate significant cash in the fourth quarter. Consequently, as we shared with you on April 18, about $1.6 billion of cash on hand will be used during the first quarter of FY 2018, when we expect to close the purchase of the Patient Recovery business from Medtronic. Next I will cover segment performance, beginning with this Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues grew 3% to $28.4 billion due to performance from the Specialty Solutions business and growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 7% to $611 million. This decrease was driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, the final quarterly impact of the loss of Safeway, and the investment in our pharmaceutical IT platform. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. During the third quarter, we began to see planned incremental expenses associated with the first few phases of our pharma IT refresh project. This multiyear project is on-time and on-budget. It will enable us to maintain the excellent service our customers have come to expect from Cardinal Health, provide us with the ability to expand in a cost-efficient manner, and better facilitate our ability to go-to-market as an integrated enterprise. Finally, our Pharma segment profit margin rate of 2.15% for the quarter was down 25 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing. A couple of other points to note on the quarter, our Specialty Solutions and China businesses saw double-digit bottom-line growth. Now, I'll move to our Medical segment results. Revenues for the quarter grew a robust 9% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 16% to $148 million, reflecting solid performance from naviHealth, supply chain services, and Cardinal Health consumable products. The quarter was unusual, in that we saw a decline in Cordis profit. This decline was mostly related to increased SG&A expenses to support our investment in an international infrastructure. This investment will benefit us as we integrate the Patient Recovery business. The increased SG&A expense was partially offset by the net impact of the Cordis inventory adjustments. Let me explain the third quarter inventory adjustments in more detail. First, this year benefited from the absence of the inventory step-up which we recorded in the prior year. This benefit was largely offset by an increase to an inventory reserve in the quarter \u2013 in the current year. This reserve is an estimate based on information often provided by third parties, including under-the-transition service agreements and from various service providers. During the period, we received more detailed information for this reserve and have adjusted it accordingly. As both George and I have mentioned in the past, the exit from the transition service and manufacturing agreements could result in some lumpiness to the Cordis earnings, but we fully expect this to diminish as we move forward. We expect Cordis to return to growth in the fourth quarter and are working hard to ensure we have the right infrastructure for the long-term to support our customers and their patients. Segment profit margin rate increased 26 basis points to 4.34% due to the same factors I just mentioned on the segment profit dollars. Turning to slide number 7, you will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. The $0.33 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs. I'll now update you on our assumptions for the fiscal year. We expect full year 2017 revenue growth to be in the mid to high single-digit percentages, which is a change from our previous outlook of high single-digit growth. One item of note, the actual closing date for the Medtronic transaction we announced on April 18 involves multiple parties, including regulators. Because of this and other factors, we need to quickly be ready to execute the best possible financing to secure attractive terms associated with the acquisition. This means that we could issue debt in the fourth quarter and, if we do, we would see up to $0.05 of financing cost, which is not included in our current fiscal 2017 EPS guidance. We will let you know when we access the debt market and be transparent on the incremental costs. To reiterate, as we shared with you on April 18, we expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at the bottom of our $5.35 to $5.50 range, and this served as the base for our fiscal 2018 early outlook. Moving on to slide 10 of the presentation, the corporate assumptions around tax rate, shares, and CapEx will be at the low-end of the range, and acquisition-related intangible amortization will now be about $389 million, or $0.81 per share, which does not affect our non-GAAP earnings. You can turn to slide 11 to see our Pharma segment assumptions for the full fiscal year. We now expect mid to high single-digit percentage revenue growth for 2017, a change from our previous outlook of high single-digit growth. This is largely related to the loss of brand sales associated with the retail network changes at CVS/pharmacy, which they disclosed in late 2016. Additionally, we now expect full year Pharma segment profit to decline low double digits versus the prior year. Note, this tightening of the range is primarily due to the previously mentioned generic market pricing, which, while less deflationary than what we saw earlier this year, is still lower than we modeled for the second half of the year. All other Pharma segment assumptions remain unchanged. On slide 12 you can see there is only one change to our Medical segment assumptions, which is we now expect a high single-digit percentage increase in revenues versus the prior year, up from our previous assumption of mid to high single-digit growth. Let me close with this. I am confident we are well-positioned and are working on the right things at the right pace for both the near term and long term. Thanks. And with that, operator, let's go to the questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question with Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the questions. You guys guided generic deflation down low double digits for the year. I'm curious if maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter relative to deflation, and then maybe how that plays into what you're expecting to see in the fourth quarter. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question. As far as the deflation goes in the quarter, we're not going to specifically comment on quarter by quarter deflation rates, other than, as you know, we did update to be \u2013 that deflation for the entire year we now expect to be in the low double digits. So, again, as I emphasized before, it's definitely lower than we had modeled in the second half, but it's improving. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, if we think about the moving pieces that drive the deflation metric, as you guys have it, next year thinking about it getting back into the mid-single digits, could you just talk about what factors will play into that improvement off of what you're expecting this year? Is it really just a comp issue, or do you have visibility into how that metric will actually improve in fiscal 2018? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. A couple things. First of all, I think one of the biggest things to think about how it will improve next year is if you actually have to break down the individual items and take a look at where the various items are going. And as you do that, what we see in that is there's a very small subset of items that have deflated significantly this year, items you probably might be aware of over the last couple of years at launch that had limited competition, either because they were hard to make or there was raw material issues or those types of things, that were relatively high priced towards the beginning of the year, or higher priced in terms of generics go, and then they deflated significantly during the year. And what we believe is that subset, that small subset of items which are very material, have really reached probably near the bottom of where they'll be. And so the impact of those items we don't see reoccurring next year, and that has a significant impact on the overall deflation rate for next year. And then when you combine that with all of the other efforts that we have in terms of pricing, sourcing, working with our customers on penetration and things like that, that's why we feel confident about where the overall deflation rate's headed. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Appreciate the comments. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. So on the Medical business, can you just expand a bit on sort of your experience so far in Cordis and how that's gone versus plan? And then, how the new Medtronic business, as that comes in, will both enhance your ex-U.S. strategy as well as your bundle in the U.S., and how you think maybe that could also further synergize your Cordis presence? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Ross, good morning. It's George. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and then Don Casey, our Medical segment CEO, is here with us, so I'll let Don weigh in a little bit. But, by and large, the thing that Mike just described on Cordis has been the hardest part, which is basically ramping up the international infrastructure. Commercially, we're actually feeling very good about the way we're positioning; we're seeing some really interesting growth, particularly outside the U.S., and we're also seeing what we always like to see, which is some demand from our global operations for other services that Cardinal has to offer. And that's always been part of our thesis. On the commercial side, some things that we see that are very optimistic. I think building up that infrastructure has been one that has taken a little more time than we expected, but we want to get it right. And, as we said, we're building a platform now, and maybe Don could talk a little bit about that. Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, and two questions. The first is, how has Cordis impacted our bundle in the U.S., and it's been very positive. I mean, we get a tremendous amount of interest from people that are very familiar with what we would consider kind of our base Cardinal Health businesses, our base brands, which tend to be a little bit more commodity-oriented now that we're moving into something like Cordis, where we can deliver value. It, one, enhances our 360 Program, which we think is important, and that's had particular resonance among our strategic accounts. Ex-U.S., we're very excited. Look, we built a platform, and George said it very well : it's taken us a little longer, and we've been very careful to create something that we could build a significant foundation on. It's taken us, A, a little bit more time and a little bit more money. But as we looked at the Patient Recovery business that we're getting from Medtronic, we think we're going to be able to slide that right on top of the foundation we've built. And that scale is going to be important in a couple ways. First, it gives us a lot more critical mass, particularly in Asia and EMEA. We believe that critical mass will allow us to have a comprehensive bundle that will be very relevant to a lot of the acute care customers there. So, we're very optimistic that the foundation we built for Cordis is going to pay dividends as we bring the Patient Recovery business on top of that, when we're able to close the business, hopefully sometime in the first quarter. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And can you just quickly update us on where you are with Kaiser, and how maybe your enhanced relationship there has helped you think through \u2013 obviously, they're a pretty dynamic organization \u2013 helped you think through what you could bring, from a distribution bundle perspective, to other potential key large IDNs in the U.S.? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, Ross, let me start, and then maybe Don will jump in. I want to be careful here, because I never want to speak for a customer. What I can say is, they are, as you mentioned, an incredibly interesting organization. We've built a business model that's really around creating value through efficiency and safety, the ability to standardize, the ability to drive cost, and the ability to actually support that through some of our clinical activities, particularly in post-acute. And I think that overall portfolio is beginning to resonate with a lot of customers. And I think a very \u2013 instead of (25:21) speaking for Kaiser, use them as an example of a highly complex integrated system, I think we're able to create real alignment with their strategies of, how do they make sure that they're treating patients in the right way, in the right setting, at the right cost. And I think that's part of the alignment strategy for us. I don't know if you want to add to that, Don. Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Just briefly, George. It's been very interesting. The conversations were \u2013 that we were six months ago, we \u2013 let's make sure that we're able to get this business up and running. It's, again, as George said, a highly complex organization that represented a significant challenge for us. We've met that challenge. We're actually delivering better customer service than they've ever experienced, and now they've begun to sit there and say, these trucks are moving into our facilities, what else can you put into them? And it's really changed the complexion of the conversation to how is this a basic distribution agreement, to how does this become a strategic asset that we can look to become much more efficient as they look to expand their own operating horizons. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Great. Thanks, guys. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Ross. Operator, next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. George, I wanted to go back on the generic pricing, and I think last quarter you talked about the sell-side margin for \u2013 sorry, the last call you talked about the sell-side margin pressure. And just wanted to get a sense on what you're seeing currently and whether what \u2013 the actions that you took in terms of revising the guidance down just a short while ago was really sort of maybe a trailing impact of now we've settled out or can you talk about the forward environment, how it looks to you? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Right. Thanks, Charles. As you know, this is a hard one to answer. As Mike said, there are things in our control and things that are not. We're doing the things in our control, as Mike said, around sourcing and pricing strategies, et cetera. How the market behaves is more out of our control. Here's what we've done as we modeled this. We try to take sort of exit rates, and we use those based on the real data and the best information we can get from sort of market condition and the feel of what we're seeing in the market and that's basically how we model. We talked, I think late in the year or early in the calendar year, about some shifting away from the very steep rates that we saw early in the fall. That did look a little better. As Mike said, it has been a bit better than it was last fall, but not I would say a full recovery, sort of the way I would say it. So we've tried to take that data we're seeing, use it real-time, use the experience that our teams have, and then just try to do some basic forward modeling. But always a little hard \u2013 lot of moving parts here and it's always a little hard to get it perfect. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Then \u2013 just a follow up then. Apart from what \u2013 the things that are in your control, if you think about the competitive market for customers, can you talk about how that pricing \u2013 is it fair to say that all your clients are now \u2013 been level-set to the sort of the new prevailing rates, including clients that may not have been up for renewal in the near term? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Right. So let me start with the basics. Again, we've said this before. As you know, this is always a competitive market. I do think that from time-to-time you see activities that seem a little bit more aggressive, and then those tend to stabilize. So, I can't speak for other companies. Everybody has their own renewal cycle. I would say we have limited exposure to major renewals. And most of what happens in the market moves across the system fairly quickly, so that's probably the best way to characterize it. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Charles. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with UBS. Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC : This is Allen in for Mike. Thanks for the question. On generic deflation, in some of the drug classes that have matured recently or undergone significant pricing pressure, are you guys seeing manufacturers rationalize production or exit markets entirely? And then, can you talk about how this compares to the past five years or so? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. So let me start. Again, trying to describe the manufacturers when there are this many is, as you can imagine, difficult. It's really each company has its own product line and its own strategy. I think we would expect on some kinds of products, where you wind up with many, many, many competitors, it's not unusual that companies will drop out. So if you wind up as a 12th launch \u2013 with a 12th launch in a product, it's not unusual that one or two players may say, look, we'd rather use our capacity directed in other areas. So I don't know that I could characterize that we've seen a ton of this, but I do think as we think about the nature of the industry, we'll see that from time to time. And we fully expect on given products where there's very mature products with lots of competition that you might see companies come in and out of those markets. Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So, the first question is about the discrete items. George, in your prepared remarks I think you talked about company specific discrete items, which largely impacted fiscal 2017 and (30:46) headwinds in fiscal year 2018. So, can you just help us and give us more detail on what were these items in 2017? And were they included in guidance before or were they incorporated into kind of like the updated outlook that you provided us last week? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Ricky, good morning. Let me turn it over to Mike actually, and this is really primarily references that we made a few weeks ago on 2018. But, Mike, if you want to... Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ricky. As you can imagine, back on April 18, while we weren't completely closed with the quarter, we had very good line of sight into what the quarter was going to look like. So when I talked about those discrete items, I was taking into account what we expected to see for really the entire full year. So those were given with the knowledge of what was going in the third quarter, so there would be no update \u2013 I'll go through the details, but there would be no update to those four discrete items just because of the actual results in the Q3 are what we see happening in Q4. Those four items were, first and foremost, the largest was tax and reserve adjustments. And, as you can see, in this quarter this year we mentioned as one of the drivers for the quarter that tax was a positive for us versus the prior year. And we knew that when we gave you some insight a few weeks ago that that would be the largest. So of the greater than $0.50 of discrete items we expect to incur this year that we'll not incur next year, tax and some reserve adjustments that I've talked about was the biggest one. The second bucket \u2013 and the next three are all similar in size \u2013 would be compensation. You heard me mention that today. So that will be an adjustment year-over-year. Investments in the business where we were very disciplined this year, particularly early on in the year as we knew how things were shaping up to be, very careful in that area and to manage our SG&A expense. And then in P-Mod, which is our Pharma Distribution IT refresh project, we know and have known that as we roll this out, that we're going to be incurring some incremental expenses over the next couple of years, particularly next year is a larger year for us in P-Mod expenses. And so those are the four that add up to the greater than $0.50, with the tax and reserve adjustments being the largest Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then my follow-up is one on brand, one on generic. Mike, I think you talked about the impact to the revenue line from loss of brand sales associated with CVS. So just trying to understand if there is any pull-through also to the profit line. And then on the generic deflation level, your gross profit in the quarter still grew year-over-year. So at what level of generic deflation year-over-year gross profit starts to decline? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. As far as the brand one related to the CVS piece, again, this was all contemplated in the guidance that we had. We had some insight into that, and is low-margin brand sale. And it doesn't really have any pull-through impact to us on generics as far as it goes to CVS. So we feel very comfortable that all of that sales decline is already modeled into our outlook for 2017, as well as our early thoughts on 2018. As far as generic deflation goes, I'm not sure what more I can talk about on that other than, again, we see it getting better. We feel like we're positioned incredibly well with Red Oak Sourcing and our pricing teams, and it's definitely getting better. Not quite as good as we modeled, but definitely getting better. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thanks very much. Good morning. George, when we spoke back two weeks ago, one of the things I think you highlighted on the drug distribution side was this idea of renegotiating some contracts specifically around penetration on the generic side. Is that something that's ongoing? You just made comments that you don't have any large renewals this year, but is that something that happens on an ongoing basis? And how should we think about how that will impact the business and the margins going forward? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Lisa, let me let Mike jump in on this one. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Lisa. A couple things on that. I think, we always have a portion of our contracts that are renewing every single year. And when we talk about renewals, we're really talking about those large renewals that are out there and to your point. So there's always independents that are renewing and other acute hospitals and stuff. And so we're constantly looking at our contracts and trying to make sure that they're fair to both the customer and to us. And so where customers are looking for improved branded pricing or improved generic pricing, we're, of course, going to look at things like, okay, then you need to commit to higher percentage of your generics from us. You're going to need to buy more OTC, HBA products from us. You may need to accelerate your terms and pay faster. And so we constantly look, as we model, to make sure we're doing all the right things to pull the levers to be fair to both the customers to meet their needs in the marketplace as well as making sure that we protect our profitability. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Lisa, I'd just add. We have a pretty comprehensive approach to thinking about the mix and the portfolio, and they are very tailored to the customer. And so I think our team does a pretty good job of really understanding the customer needs here. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Is there a way to think about where penetration is today on generic purchasing and where it potentially could go? When we think about stabilization, my execution would be, in that independent market, that there's less stabilization if you have, obviously, more places that you can buy product. So the more you can lock your customer in on the penetration side, the more stable it will become. So how do we think about where it is today and where it potentially could go as you think about all the other elements that Mike talked about in those conversations? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Lisa, why don't I start just very broadly, generic penetration rate actually varies a fair amount across classes. We think classes tend to be pretty steady. So there are areas \u2013 so, for example, a chain drug tends to be very high. Independent pharmacies have been growing significantly in recent years in their penetration rate. I would say that institutional area is still little bit lower in overall generic penetration rate. And so we're thinking about each of these areas and where there's opportunities. The other thing that we've talked about in the past is that we still have in the system some purchasers of generic drugs that do a hybrid of buying directly and through a channel partner, and we see those as opportunities. We think we're an extremely efficient sourcer of products and our value proposition downstream is very broad and comprehensive. And so, for us, that's another lever that we think about all the time, which is how do we basically create the incentive and encourage all those players to source their generic through us. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Mike, what did you see for brand inflation this past quarter, and what are your expectations for brand inflation for fiscal 2018, please? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. So brand inflation, just a couple comments. As I mentioned earlier, I did say it was just a little bit less than where we expected it to be within the range of the 7% to 9% that we gave in the last quarter. And so it's still tracking within that range, but again, a little lower than we had originally modeled for the quarter in the second half. And that being said, it's a small driver for the second half of the year. And quite honestly, we have been at \u2013 over 85% of our branded agreements are now non-contingent to inflation. I would expect that, if not by the end of FY 2018, definitely during the year, or by the end, we will be at closer to 90%, if not even slightly over 90% by the end of the year. So, I think what we're \u2013 we're seeing a couple things. One, we're making ourselves less and less dependent upon it. And because it's already gone down from low double digits to more high single, I think the risk of it going significantly lower in the future, I think, is lower also. And so I don't see that as a big driver, one way or the other, for 2018 and, honestly, even probably 2019 and those years going forward, unless there's dramatic changes in the environment. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then you said that generic deflation has improved. Can you give any more color around that, like when exactly did you sort of start seeing this improvement? Was it like in the March of 2017 timeframe? And then, we say things have improved, but we're now expecting sort of double-digit deflation for the full year. Can you put any numbers around \u2013 to go from 11% to say 9% in March? Any more color would be really helpful. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. A couple things. Remember, when we're talking about an entire year rate of low double digits, and it was significantly lower in the first half of the year, so, as you could imagine, what we'd expected it to improve a little bit more, to average out to low double digits for the year. And so, again, it is improving, and the low double digits is an average for the entire year. And you do remember, probably back on one of the other quarter calls, we said we started seeing it get better in the December quarter. There was a lot of noise in there for launches. And, as I said, we see it getting better in the second half, just not as good as we had modeled. Operator : We'll take our next question from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, George and Mike. Just related to a prior question, so on branded manufacture contracting, when trends had begun to moderate a few quarters back, there was the possibility to go back to have a candid two-way dialogue to make the contracts more of a win-win. So have you gone back to successfully update some of those contracts to reflect current trends with any sizable drug partners since then? If there's any sort of a metric you can provide as to what percent has been completed or not. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hi, Garen. It's George. I'll start, and then let Mike jump in. I think we're going to be careful about describing, in too much detail, any of our proprietary conversations with our manufacturer partners. But you should assume that we are pretty regularly in dialogue with all of our manufacturer partners, and we've worked closely together for years and when there's some shifting around, I think we work hard to make sure that we're getting compensated for the work that we do. And I think those conversations are productive. I don't know if you want to... Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add is, my whole comment around going from 85% to at least 90% is all around the success of those agreements, and we're already seeing that rate increase. So you can assume that we've been able to work through some of the conversations with some of the manufacturers, and are continuing to have very productive dialogue with other manufacturers, and that's what's leading to us being able to increase from over 85% to 90% timeframe. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, that was (43:08) useful. And then as a quick follow-up. Related to marketplace M&A, asking in sort of new generic terms, when one of your larger pharmacy clients that purchases both generics and brands from you acquires a substantial asset, set of stores, whatever you want to call it, how do those contracts evolve? Do they simply flow through the current contract typically, or are contracts typically set up where there's a mechanism that initiates a new contract conversation? Anything you could elaborate on there, in generic terms? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, Garen, and it's probably going to be disappointing, because it's hard for us to give specifics about these relationships, but it varies all across the board. There are sometimes where the \u2013 built into the agreement is just an extension of what we're doing. Sometimes there's some discussion that has to take place, given a new portfolio and a new mix. So, each story is its own story, I would say. And again, for us to try to characterize this generally would be a mistake. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator... Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, George. On the naviHealth upside, what drove that, and how do you get paid for that? Why isn't it a bit more predictable? And then a quick one for Mike. Just, you mentioned a better fourth quarter cash flow experience. But why didn't the working capital accounts, inventories, receivables, payables, trend as well as we'd hoped for in the third quarter? What was the setback there? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Bob, I'll take the first part of it, and turn it over to Mike. I think the naviHealth value proposition is so clearly aligned with what's happening in care. We have an aging population, so the post-acute area is a particular hot button. We know that there's a huge percentage of Medicare spend that occurs in the post-acute setting. So our ability to reduce costs, reduce readmission, reduce time of stay, those are powerful drivers, I think. And almost independent of any short-term policy issues, we know that that's valuable. And I think that's part of what's been steering the attention to naviHealth. Part of the business model is very steady and predictable on a per-patient per-month basis. Some of it has to do with, what I'll say, gain sharing or savings programs. And so there's going to be some natural \u2013 again, when you use the word lumpiness, it's of course a technical term of Art here (45:35). But there is some natural bumpiness to this, because you have to \u2013 basically you reconcile after a period of time on the share and on the savings that you've created. So some part of that model has that dynamic, but it is a really exciting part of our portfolio and we're thrilled to have it. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And as far as working capital goes, Bob, there's nothing fundamental that's changed in the net working capital. In other words, no big vendor term changes or customer mix changes or anything. It's more just the timing around some inventory builds related to some of the IT changes that we're doing and a few other projects that we have going on that we think we'll work through here in the fourth quarter and see significant cash flow in the fourth quarter. But no fundamental changes going on in the net working capital. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: George, is there a new business number or a backlog number, anything like that, for naviHealth we can point to? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Bob, that's a great question. We've never provided that. It just hasn't been part of our public disclosures. All I can say is broadly, the demand for our work in naviHealth is substantial; and at times, I wish we could keep up with it. So we're working really hard to build out the capabilities to make sure that we can support the interest in that kind of, I'm going to say, predictive analytics to help drive patients to the right side of care and to manage them effectively. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: And again, even if there was, just because the agreements take time for the results to pop out, we might indicate what's in the pipeline, but it would still be hard to predict what the savings are until you actually work through the process with the customer. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Kyle, next question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. A question on the Patient Recovery business. Looking at the Medical business [Technical Difficulty] (47:41) and they're running high-teens margins and what Medtronic has said about the impact [Technical Difficulty] (47:48) those margins even expanded. When I back out the inventory cost and look at the [Technical Difficulty] (47:54) contribution. And so I know that acquisition cost... Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Actually, Eric, I'm sorry to interrupt to. You're breaking up a bit. If you're on a cell phone, we're getting kind of every other word. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Guys, well, let me put it simply. The Medical Patient Recovery businesses, is there an expectation for cost and transition services that's going to weigh on the margin relative to what we saw at Covidien? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you. Eric, good morning. Sorry, we just couldn't hear the first time around. Now we got you. So I think one of the things that has been a great learning on the Cordis thing is, particularly in the international operations, the work that we need to do to ensure that there's no disruption to the patients. So I think we've done that work, and as we did the business planning and the modeling for this acquisition, we took all the learnings from that international work that we did with Cordis, and it was applied into our model. So we feel very good about that. The second thing I would just add is that on the international side, we are building out those capabilities to support Cordis. And so, as Don said, I think we'll start to see a framework that we can roll business onto internationally. I guess, the third point would be, proportionally, more of the Patient Recovery business is actually in the U.S., and that's riding on a system that we know and use every day with our consumables business. We will have some transition agreements on the Patient Recovery business, but I think we've modeled those very carefully. Mike, you want to add something to this? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, just a couple things. Related to the transition service agreements, transition manufacturing agreements, we actually have them going both ways. And so both companies are highly invested in each other's success here. So I think that will be an important thing as we work through those, and I think that's important. A couple other learnings is, on the Cordis piece, the U.S. piece has gone really well, in terms of infrastructure, has gone right according to plan. And remember that this Patient Recovery business is largely U.S., and so we feel really good about our back office capabilities in the U.S. And as George mentioned, ex-U.S, we are definitely going to be able to leverage what we're doing with Cordis on the Patient Recovery business. And then just two other quick things is, I think we've done a very nice job in managing the R&D mix in terms of expenses and managing that. Don and team have been able to manage that well, really held onto sales momentum and actually created some. And just to wrap it up, from my point is that we did mention too, that the Cordis business would return to growth in Q4. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: One thing I might want to add, just to make sure we're totally clear on this. So there are costs associated with the transition agreements, but I think what we're saying is we've built those in. So I don't want to suggest there's cost. Transition agreements temporarily create some costs, but I think we've modeled those very effectively and we've taken all the learning from the Cordis to make sure we're doing that very well outside the U.S. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. George or Mike, the sell-side pricing pressure that you guys have talked about the last couple of quarters for generics, have you seen any of that bleed into either traditional brand or specialty? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No, I wouldn't think so. I would say that the repricing has been normal in the brand and specialty. It's hard. The only reason you heard a little bit of a hesitation is they're all kind of bid as one basket, right? And so if you just look at a customer who was buying brand from us in one year to the next, I wouldn't say there's been anything unusual at all from any erosion on that. That tends to be \u2013 it flows right off of the WACC manufacturer price, whereas the generics is more of a market price that adjusts up and down on a daily basis. So they're very different markets, but no, nothing of concern in the brand or specialty market that I would call out. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. And then a question for Don was in Medical. Once you complete the Medtronic asset purchase, does that sort of complete your sort of shopping list to build out a cardinal brand, or are there other categories where you have a high level of interest in adding? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Don, give a go and I'll jump in. Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Look, once we complete this, it's going to take us a little while to digest this business and really make sure we're optimizing this and Cordis, and that's going to take us a fair amount of time, talent, and treasure to get that done. Once we are finished that, we'll put our head up and see where we want to go. But right now, we feel very good about the fact that we've built a really strong group of products, of services, that are really putting together a pretty compelling offer that's winning in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on making sure we do a great job on integrating the Patient Recovery business, and then we'll go from there. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, John. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. So I do hate to beat the generic questions to death, but just a high-level question on the sequential flow of generic drug profits from the March quarter to the June quarter. Your phrase that generic pricing is worse than expected, but getting better is still, I think, turning some of us off a little bit. I guess the question is, if we were to isolate just your generic drug profits for the upcoming June quarter versus the March quarter just reported, in your budgeting do you expect directionally that those generic profits would be down sequentially? Could they still be flattish sequentially, or could they even be up? Because you keep talking about the \"generic pricing getting better.\" So maybe the sequential conversation might help us out a little bit. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: That's hard to do. Let me see if I can help a little bit. Again, the low double digits is an annual rate, and so if you start with a higher double digits number in the first half of the year, you have to see second half has to be better, and again, we are seeing it better than the first half, but not quite as good as what we had expected. Again, if you just take a look at the curve is \u2013 what we're saying is better means it's less steep on the curve, and so the declines are less in the second half. Now we've always, historically, typically get deflation and we've just seen over the last few years some unique sets of items seeing significant inflation that have offset that. So I think it's hard to just look at the deflation as one single component. To me, the key is that curve being less steep, but at the same time, using Red Oak and our customer mix and our other initiatives to continue to drive down costing even more so that we can begin to either maintain or grow our margins. That to me is one of the keys that we're clearly working on. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And one quick follow-up. I think I heard a comment from you guys about the CVS revenues being a little bit softer and that prompted a little bit lower revenue outlook for the Pharma segment. But did that get worse as the March quarter progressed, the CVS revenues and prompted you to lower the revenue guidance now from them or are you just sort of playing catch-up on some trends that have been in place since January? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, that's really the news that CVS had given at late in calendar 2016 around some of the contract changes that they had. And so we saw that hit us early right in the quarter, and so we saw the impact in the March quarter, we projected it into our Q4 and through next year. So this all contemplated in everything that we've given you in terms of brand sales and our impact on the revenue line and the bottom line, and so it is low-margin brand sales and so we don't see it having a significant impact to it. But again, everything that it does have and any impact is already contemplated in all of the 2017 and 2018 guidance that we've given to you guys. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Kyle, is there anybody else? Operator : We have no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Kyle. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to all of you in the coming days and weeks. And with that, have a good day. We'll talk soon. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Cardinal Health fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings and fiscal year 2018 guidance conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to this morning's call to discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2017 earnings and fiscal 2018 guidance. With me today are Chairman and CEO, George Barrett; CFO, Mike Kaufman; and VP Investor Relations, Lisa Capodici. George and Mike will have some prepared comments, and then we'll move into Q&A. Since we will be making forward-looking statements, we need to remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slides at the beginning of the presentation found on the Investor page of our website for a description of risks and uncertainties. We will be ending today's conference call promptly at 9 :45. To more efficiently get through our question-and-answer queue, we're limiting each individual to one question with one follow-up. As always, the IR team will be available if you have an additional question. There are a few items I want to highlight today. First, you may see a second posting of our 8-K filing today. The components were initially misclassified on the SEC website, so we're fixing that. But there is no change to the content. And second, we'll be presenting at the Robert W. Baird Healthcare Conference on Thursday, September 7, at 9 :05 a.m. Eastern in New York, and at the Morgan Stanley 15th Annual Global Healthcare Conference on Monday, September 11, at 8 :45 Eastern in New York. Before I turn the call over to George, as many of you know September 18 will be my last day at Cardinal Health. It has been an honor to be a Cardinal Health Investor Relations officer and to serve you for nearly a decade. I'll continue to work closely with George, Mike, and Lisa to make this transition as seamless as possible. Lisa has more than 30 years of finance and IR experience. And she and her team will serve the company well. So after more than three decades as an IRO and spokesperson, more than 120 earnings calls, more than 400 sell site events, several thousand investor meetings, and millions of frequent-flier miles, I'm looking forward to parlaying all that experience into my new Savannah-based consulting business. I've made great friendships with many of you that I know will stand the test of time. And I look forward to catching up with you over the coming weeks. Now on to the earnings call. George? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Sally. Good morning, and thank you for joining our year-end call. These past 12 months have been trying ones for those of us in health care. Our fiscal 2017 was a year of challenges but also a year in which we took important actions to strengthen our market positioning, grow our scale, add new long-term drivers of growth, and improve the overall balance of our integrated portfolio. These actions will have significant impact over the next two years to five years. With this in mind I'll devote most of my commentary to the year completed and the year in front of us, letting Mike provide details on Q4, which came in largely as we expected. Before I begin, I'd like to make a quick comment about our guidance for fiscal 2018. Our perspective on the environment and our operating performance for FY 2018 has remained fairly consistent since we provided an early outlook back in April. We will however, take actions this year, which have some impact on our EPS for fiscal 2018 relative to that early outlook. We feel confident that this work will accelerate our growth rate trajectory in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Mike will cover these incremental items in his commentary. While demand for the health care products and services we provide continues to grow, powered by demographic changes that will only accelerate in the years ahead, a combination of market dynamics, policy uncertainty, and economic forces made our FY 2017 among the most difficult years to model and predict. The impact of those dynamics was most pronounced in our Pharma Distribution business, where pricing was a material headwind that was mostly associated with generics. We have talked about this pricing phenomenon all year and spoke about it extensively in April. Along the way however, we have also indicated that most of the Cardinal Health portfolio has been performing extremely well. And we feel confident that we are well positioned for the long term. Let me emphasize, I like our position in the markets in which we compete. That said let me give you some observations about our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. It remains an anchor tenant in our portfolio and very valuable to the broader health care system. Cardinal Health manages an intricate network, which includes complex contracting, global sourcing, extensive regulatory interfaces, and a vital interconnection between manufacturers, providers, and patients, giving us a leadership role in the safest and most secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world. Ours is a business of enormous scale, innovation, and efficiency, both in terms of operations and return on capital. And perhaps most important, it provides a critical and valuable service to our thousands of retail, hospital, and institutional pharmacy customers and their patients, as well as our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. Having said this, there's no doubt that pricing dynamics, most notably in generics, has been a challenge for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And at a time where we were getting little benefit from new generic product launches. This dynamic weighed heavily on our numbers in FY 2017. To be clear, we are taking actions to address the changes in the market, including, one, employing advanced analytics and pricing strategies; two, reducing SG&A costs; and three, pursuing novel approaches to grow our consumer product offerings for our customers. We are taking these steps at a time where our service levels and line item fill rates are at historic highs, our customer retention numbers are outstanding. And our PSAO network, the group of pharmacies for whom we negotiate network inclusion, continues to grow, now serving over 5,600 members. We support this work with a suite of valuable services, including a growing medication management program, tele-pharmacy, inventory management, and reimbursement support, all of which help enable our customers to better compete and better serve their patients. We've built a strong model in Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. And it continues to contribute nicely and is a source of strength for us and our customers. Recently we've designed a program to enable Cardinal Health and CVS Health to jointly source our OTC and consumer products. While this offers a considerably smaller opportunity than that associated with our generics program, we still believe that this scale will be beneficial to our customers and to us. Our Specialty Solutions group generated outstanding growth this year with annual sales now exceeding $12 billion. We've grown along all dimensions, expanding our therapeutic reach and growing both our acute customer base and the number of clinicians and physician practices we serve. And we expect this trend to continue. We've also grown our service offerings to our bio-pharma partners, helping manufacturers obtain global product approval, make informed strategy decisions, and expand product reach. Our patient support hub improves patient access and adherence, helping to ensure that patients get the right medicine in the right way, at the right time, and stay compliant with their treatment pathways. So this was also a strong year for our nuclear business. And we now serve more than 1 million patients each month. Of particular note, we are now the only alpha radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in North America and have received Health Canada, EU, and FDA market approval. The first commercial batch of Xofigo was manufactured in June and has already been used by patients. Our Medical segment showed excellent growth this year with contributions coming in broadly. Our Medical/Surgical Distribution unit had the strongest growth in recent years. And we drove growth among critical business lines, including surgical kitting, lab, and medical services. We also had excellent growth from our post-acute activities, which include naviHealth and Cardinal Health at Home. Five years ago our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio contained 4,800 SKUs in 470 categories. Today we have nearly 12,000 product SKUs spanning 850 categories to support customers who seek standardization and cost efficiencies in product category where there is little clinical differentiation. As we integrate the newly acquired Patient Recovery business from Medtronic, this number grows to nearly 21,000 product SKUs spanning more than 1,200 categories. Now let me take a few minutes to provide an update on Cordis. We have always placed patient care as the top priority in our work. Very early on in the integration of this business it was clear to us \u2013 and we shared with you \u2013 that given our priority and the number of interfaces with J&J that we would need to navigate as we built out a global infrastructure to fully stand up the business, achieving our target synergies would take longer than originally modeled. We are creating a global platform. And the actions we've taken to build this infrastructure will prove particularly valuable as we integrate the 25% of the Patient Recovery business which operates outside of the U.S. On the Commercial side we've made considerable progress over the year. We saw solid sales growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Europe. Our U.S. business, which had a slow start as we merged the organization with our AccessClosure business, is getting its sea legs. And the progress has been encouraging. As we look to next year for Cordis, while much of the heavy lifting is behind us, it's still not complete. We are getting some commercial momentum and have signed distribution partnerships to expand our product portfolio, which now includes a coronary drug-eluting stent, a side branch stent to treat significant coronary bifurcation lesions, and balloon catheters. Finally, turning to the Patient Recovery business, we are tremendously excited to have closed this transaction late last week. This is a product line that has been on our radar for many years. It is a product portfolio that fits naturally into the work that we're doing across the continuum of care, in product categories and channels with which we have enormous expertise. The addition of the Patient Recovery business into our Enterprise portfolio strengthens our ability to offer a broad line of products and services, which are extremely important to our customer base across multiple channels. There is much to be done to integrate this business. And we are so pleased to welcome to the organization our new colleagues from around the world, a highly talented group of people who share our values and our commitment to quality. Through it all our people have remained passionate in their commitment to improve the efficiency, safety, and quality of health care. Our organization has remained firmly focused on delivering value to our customers, keeping them in a competitive position, so they can best serve their patients. And we've maintained a clear perspective on the long-term enduring value of our enterprise. With these priorities front and center, we are taking a number of actions during the upcoming year to continue to drive efficiency, better align the organization so that our customers can take full advantage of the comprehensive strength of our enterprise offerings, enhance the long-term positioning of our portfolio, improve the execution of our global products organization, and support our people. I'd like to focus on one of those actions, our portfolio analysis. We are committed to creating value through an integrated portfolio across the enterprise, which we regularly review to ensure that, one, we are or can be capable of establishing a leadership position; and, two, the line of business is valuable to our customers and furthers our mission of helping to make health care more cost-effective, safe, and high-quality. With this discipline in mind, we are evaluating certain aspects of that portfolio for alignment with those goals. As an outgrowth of this process, we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Service and Distribution business in China. Our China business has shown solid growth in the years since the acquisition of Yong Yu. And our Chinese colleagues have done excellent work in building out the portfolio. The China market clearly has outstanding potential for further growth. However, to take full advantage of this growth and to attain the market leadership we seek, it would take a level of investment that we believe could be more effectively deployed in other parts of our portfolio. As I mentioned at the beginning of my commentary, very little has changed in our expectations for FY 2018 since we spoke to you in April. Underlying that early outlook was an assumption that our Enterprise operating performance would grow. Four months later, that underlying assumption remains unchanged. We are running this business with the long game in mind. Our goal is to create enduring value for all of our stakeholders. We do intend to take some actions this year, which we think are important to our future and which will position us to accelerate growth in FY 2019 but will negatively impact our EPS for FY 2018. As a result, we expect our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.10. Mike will cover this and walk you through the numbers to bridge our early outlook to today's guidance. As we move beyond fiscal 2018, we expect to see strong growth in 2019 and beyond. For historic perspective, some of you will remember that we made similar decisions during another challenging year in 2009, when we provided insights into how we saw the future. At that time we said that we needed to make strategic decisions and key investments to provide reliably high performance. Since the spinoff of CareFusion through the end of fiscal 2017, we've delivered total shareholder return of 272%, including reinvested dividends. Our approach then was the same as it is now : Make the important moves today for a more financially secure future. We are well-positioned to play a vital role in health care and its transformation. And we look at all our decisions and actions with our ability to create value for the long term as the backdrop. Let me finally address one more important topic. You should expect to see us take a more visible role in helping to address the national opioid epidemic. We intend to make a serious investment to support efforts to address the opiate crisis. Like others around the country, many of us at Cardinal Health have been touched personally by this public health crisis. And all of us are deeply troubled by the devastating impact that drug addiction is having on our communities. We are, however, encouraged to see those communities come together with policy makers and acknowledge that this is a multidimensional problem, one that cannot be addressed meaningfully by a single player or by standalone efforts. The search for blame is the enemy of the search for solutions. Addressing this national crisis requires open dialogue among all stakeholders, coordination, and work on both the supply and the demand side. Nine years ago Cardinal Health Foundation launched its Generation Rx initiative to combat drug abuse and misuse. And now we are building on that platform with a pilot program targeted at some of the hardest hit counties throughout Appalachia. Partnering with law enforcement, educators, and community groups, we will be working to promote education, prevention, product donations, and implement drug takeback strategies. With this work we believe we can have a positive effect on some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods. We look forward to telling you more about our plan in the coming months. And we are engaging with partners across business, regulators, and non-profits to have the greatest impact. This commitment is part of who we are at Cardinal Health. We know that solutions require planning and time and cooperation. In spite of market challenges and policy uncertainty, our people manage to stay focused on one thing : serving their customers so that patients can receive the care, services, and products they need. For that I am most appreciative. And I thank all of our very committed members of the Cardinal Health team around the world. One final note before I turn the call over to Mike. As many of you know, Sally Curley, our SVP of IR and my partner for these nine years, has decided to join her husband in Savannah, Georgia, where they will plant stakes in the ground, set sail \u2013 one of her great joys \u2013 and set up her own consultancy. How Sally can pick her husband over Cardinal Health is a mystery to me. But we are excited for Sally, and we'll miss her daily presence. She has been recognized consistently over the years as one of the leading practitioners of her craft. Moving into FY 2018 we will benefit from the training that she has provided to her team. And we will have her with us through the early fall, ensuring a smooth transition. And with that, thank you, Sally. And I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call. As George said, it has been a trying year but also a year of significant accomplishments, as the organization has taken a number of important steps. I will divide my comments into two primary areas. First, I plan to provide some greater specifics and clarity on our numbers for the quarter and the year. Then I will give you some additional color on our FY 2018 and provide a financial bridge from the early outlook we provided in April to our updated FY 2018 guidance. The financial results that I provide this morning will all be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Slides 7 and 11 of the presentation on our website include our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables for the fourth quarter and full year. Let me start by discussing the financial performance for the quarter and full year as detailed on Slides 4 and 8 respectively. The quarter ended up largely where we guided when we spoke in April, except for our tax rate, which was lower than expected. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% to $33 billion, while full year revenues increased 7% to $130 billion. Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 1% and were flat for the full fiscal year. Gross margin rate decreased in the fourth quarter and full year by 22 and 35 basis points respectively. The drivers for these three items are best explained when I cover the segments in greater detail. SG&A expenses increased for the quarter, largely because of our important investment in the IT system refresh in the Pharma segment. Again this major project, which we refer internally as P-Mod, is designed to improve long term customer service and interactions. So far it has been on time and on budget. And I feel very good about the success of future phases. For the year SG&A expenses increased largely as a result of strategic acquisitions and the impact of the P-Mod project. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation and disciplined management of expenses. Non-GAAP operating earnings decreased 1% to $640 million for the fourth quarter and decreased 4% to $2.8 billion for the year. Moving below the operating line, for the fourth quarter net interest and other expense was $65 million, which is roughly a $20 million increase over the prior year. This increase relates to the costs associated with our financing of the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, which as George mentioned, we were thrilled to close over this past weekend. The drivers for the full year variance are consistent with those noted for the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% for the fourth quarter. The tax rate was notably lower, as we saw tax benefits from the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the Patient Recovery acquisition. In addition, there were several other discrete tax benefits in the quarter, most of which will not repeat in fiscal 2018. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 32.6%. Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 318 million and 320 million, respectively. We did not execute any share repurchases during the fourth quarter. However, our fiscal 2017 total share repurchases were about $600 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payout, totals a robust $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. We continue to have $443 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program. The impact of all of these items resulted in an increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS of 15% to $1.31 for the quarter and an increase of 3% to $5.40 for the full year. Moving on to operating cash flow. We generated $724 million in the quarter, an improvement over the prior year. Operating cash flow was lower than we expected for the quarter because of nearly $400 million of vendor payments that were made early due to some changes included in our Q4 P-Mod implementation. The impact of this will be resolved in Q1 of FY 2018. Our full year operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, of which we deployed $387 million in capital expenditures. Key areas in which we were invested were around acquisition support and improvements to our existing infrastructure, including P-Mod. Overall, we ended the year with cash including short term investments of approximately $6.9 billion, of which $569 million were held outside the United States. This unusually high cash balance includes the proceeds of the $5.2 billion bond issuance in June. Remember that $4.5 billion was designated to fund the Patient Recovery acquisition with the remaining amount mainly to fund the debt payments made in July. The $6.1 billion Patient Recovery acquisition, completed this past week, was funded by the $4.5 billion of the bond issuance, cash on hand, and borrowings of $700 million under our existing credit arrangements. Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 5 and 9. Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% to $29.6 billion. For the year revenue grew 7% to $116.5 billion. Both the quarter and full year increases were driven by growth from Pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance in the Specialty Solutions business. Segment profit for the fourth quarter decreased 7% to $505 million, primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing as well as the ongoing investment in P-Mod. These were partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing. Segment profit for the full year decreased 12% to $2.2 billion due to generic pharmaceutical pricing and to a lesser extent the loss of Safeway and lower branded manufacturer price appreciation. Again the solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing provided some offset to these numbers. For the fourth quarter and full year our segment profit margin rate declined 22 and 40 basis points, respectively. These declines were largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing, which we have discussed throughout the year. Consistent with recent comments, while this continues to be a headwind, the environment, while still competitive, seems to be stabilizing. Now let's move to Slides 6 and 10 to review the Medical segment results for the quarter and the full year. Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers. Revenue for the year grew 9% to $13.5 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers and to a lesser extent acquisitions. Fourth quarter segment profit increased 13% to $138 million, reflecting solid performance from post-acute solutions, favorability from compensation related items, and growth in distribution services. These were partially offset by performance in Cardinal Health branded products including Cordis. For the year segment profit increased 25% to $572 million due to the contribution from post-acute solutions, Cardinal Health branded products including Cordis, favorability from compensation related items, and growth in distribution services. Medical segment profit rate for the fourth quarter and full year increased 22 and 56 basis points. Both increases were driven by the same factors affecting the segment profit. I know that George gave you some high level thoughts on Cordis, so let me give you some further details. As you know we've been working over the past 18 months to build out our global infrastructure for Cordis. The costs of this build out have been more than expected and have had a negative impact on SG&A and gross margin for the quarter and year. Specifically, the cost of moving manufacturing and standing up our back office services has been more expensive than we modeled. But I feel we have solid plans to address this in the first half of FY 2018. Mainly due to these increased costs, we did not achieve our fiscal 2017 accretion target of $0.15. In addition to the higher SG&A and manufacturing costs, mainly outside the U.S., there are two other factors that affected the accretion this fiscal year. First, we experienced lower than anticipated sales from partnership agreements. These agreements, while behind our original projections, are on a significant growth trajectory. And second, we incurred higher than planned write-offs for excess inventory. With the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, the investments that we've made in standing up our global business are important to best position the Medical segment over the long term. Now on to the details of fiscal 2018. My forward looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP. since we do not provide GAAP future guidance, due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. Starting on Slide 13, we expect mid-single digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues and expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.10. Let me bridge this guidance to what we provided in our early outlook in April. First, we experienced some additional discrete items, mostly in taxes, that caused us to finish higher than we expected. This higher finish of about $0.06, when including the cost of issuing the debt for the Patient Recovery acquisition, impacts our FY 2018 growth rate. Also we recently included three additional items in our FY 2018 guidance that total about $0.16 that we had not included in our April early outlook. First, we have identified some customer initiatives and actions we plan to take in fiscal 2018, which will benefit us longer term. The majority of the items sit in the Pharma segment and are why we lowered our segment profit assumption from high single digit decline to low double digit decline. Second, as George mentioned in his remarks, we intend to make a serious investment to support education, prevention, and local communities in their efforts to address the opioid crisis. And finally, we are in the process of evaluating some tax planning that will be a headwind in fiscal 2018 but will benefit us over the longer term. This is reflected in our full year tax rate. So in summary, the bridge from our April 18 early outlook to our guidance of $4.85 to $5.10, consists of about a $0.06 higher finish combined with about $0.16 of discrete items we believe will help us for the coming years. We are confident in our assumptions and have identified the key elements that will affect us in the coming year. This has been a thorough process. And we are well positioned now to achieve these results in fiscal 2018 and beyond. On Slide 14 you will see five corporate assumptions for fiscal 2018. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates, as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items. Second, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 319 million to 320 million. This assumes share repurchases will offset dilution and will occur in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we plan to pay off notes of about $550 million in June of fiscal 2018. This is part of our commitment to pay down $1.5 billion of debt during the next three years. Third, we expect net interest and other expense to increase to $340 million to $360 million, due \u2013 mainly due to debt issued for the Patient Recovery acquisition. Fourth, we expect capital investment to be in the range of $500 million to $540 million, which includes costs associated with the integration of our acquisitions and the important ongoing investment in P-Mod. And finally, we assume amortization of approximately $370 million or $0.78 [per share], which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again this is excluded from non-GAAP and does not include amortization from the Patient Recovery business, which is expected to be significant. Now let me drill down to the Pharma segment assumptions you will see on Slide 15. Beginning with revenues, we expect a low to mid-single digit percentage increase versus the prior year. Please note that we expect first half growth to be significantly lower than the second half, due to the lapping of certain customer changes. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be down low double digits versus the prior year. Other key assumptions for Pharma are, first, generic drug prices are modeled to deflate in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. When we talk about generic market pricing, it is forward looking and includes the impact on both the buy side and sell side. Next, we are modeling brand drug manufacturer price changes of 7% to 8% inflation for the full fiscal year. Of note, as we exited fiscal 2017 less than 10% of our brand margin is now contingent on inflation. There will be incremental expense related to the continued investment in P-Mod to support growth. Also there is an incremental contribution from new generic launches year over year, but the benefit will be significantly less. Next, there will be incremental contribution from Red Oak Sourcing but less on a year-over-year basis. We expect double digit growth in revenue and profit from the Specialty Solutions business. And finally, our model assumes that we have a full year of contribution from Cardinal Health China. As a reminder, China reports in both segments but primarily contributes to our Pharmaceutical segment. For fiscal 2018 the revenues for Cardinal Health China should exceed $4 billion. As George mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for this business. Let's now move to expectations and assumptions for our Medical segment for fiscal 2018, which you can find on Slide 16. We expect revenues to increase in the high teens percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect strong double digit segment profit growth. Other key assumptions for Medical include, first, the Patient Recovery acquisition is accretive by $0.21, integrates into the Cardinal Health brand business, and has an inventory step-up in the first half of fiscal 2018 of up to $100 million. In addition, we expect solid growth from all of our other Medical businesses and that the second half segment profit margin rate will exceed 6%. One large headwind will be the loss of a significant portion of the VA contract. The full effect began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as the transition to the new suppliers took much longer than expected. Finally, we are not modeling a reinstatement of a medical device tax. Another item of note is that in our first quarter of 2018, in accordance with GAAP accounting principles, we will adopt the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. We do not expect a significant impact on EPS as a result of a discrete tax benefit or expense. While we don't generally provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some color on what we are seeing for Q1. First, we will see a tough comparison in the Pharma segment associated with generic pharmaceutical pricing in the first quarter. Second, in the first half of fiscal 2018 we expect to see the inventory step-up for the Patient Recovery business. Next, expenses related to P-Mod will negatively impact both our first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. And finally, we will see considerably reduced contribution from the change in the VA contract. As a result of these items, we are currently modeling roughly 20% of our full year non-GAAP EPS in our first quarter. Now for 2019. Given the actions we are taking this year, we are targeting non-GAAP EPS of at least $5.60. As we exit FY 2019, we'll be a business that has multiple engines of growth, increasing balance across the portfolio and excellent alignment with health care trends. Thanks for bearing with me through my rather long prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question and for all the information there. Maybe, George or Mike, you talked about China a little bit earlier. Can you talk about sort of how is that currently \u2013 is that currently still in the guidance as we're looking forward? And can you give a sense for the magnitude of its \u2013 sort of the contribution it's given the business in case something happens? And then secondly, I think you mentioned in the Medical business you acquired within Cordis, a drug-eluting stent. Do you have \u2013 is there any kind of approval processes you need to go through to market that in the U.S.? Or is that something currently just in Europe? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question. As it relates to China, we are assuming a full year of contribution in China in our FY 2018. So it's assumed to be all the way through June 30 of this year. But then we are assuming \u2013 and when we say at least $5.60 of earnings in FY 2019, we are not including China in our FY 2019 guidance. Now since it's probably a follow-up question, we are assuming there'll be some redeployment of capital. But right now in our at least $5.60, China would be slightly dilutive to us in our FY 2019 numbers. And, George, would you like to handle the stent? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Sure. Hi. Good morning, Charles. On the second part of your question, the drug-eluting stent was actually not part of the Patient Recovery business that we acquired, but actually done through partnership. If you remember, we talked about the fact that we'd be adding to the portfolio largely through opportunities to partner. And that's what we've done here. So it's an approved product and not something that we acquired through the Patient Recovery business. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: And by the way, to be clear, this is not for the U.S. market right now. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And if you listened on my comments, I made a comment that the partnership agreements were on a significant growth trajectory for FY 2018. And this would be one of the items that we expect to drive that growth for us in FY 2018. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for all of the color. And, Sally, again wishing you best of luck in the new role. So just wanted to understand some of the additional customer actions. As you think about the investments you're making, how many of these do you view as defensive, reactionary? I know there's a lot that's positioning for the long term health of the business. But part of I think what I'm trying to understand and I think some other people are trying to understand is just are these going to be truly one time in nature in terms of strength of the business now? Or is there a need over time, especially in an increasingly competitive market, to continue to pursue these types of investments for the long-term health of the business? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Michael, good morning. It's George. I'll take that and then Mike can jump in. I think our perspective in dealing with our customers is always sort of on the, how do we grow opportunity? How do we see the opportunity to partner more deeply with them and create growth over the long term? And so while I can't go into details on these programs, that's sort of the underlying assumption. As we mentioned earlier of course, as you said, it is a competitive market. But our position with our customers is strong. There are things that we see that are opportunities to solidify those relationships and create new value. And that's sort of what is the focus of our work. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And I wouldn't see these investments as something we have to make incrementally each year. This is something that again we have an option to make this year. If we don't think we'll get the right returns out of those investments, we don't necessarily have to make those. And that could provide some upside for us this year. But we thought it was prudent to build these in, because we think there's some things that we'd like to do that we think are important for us to be able to solidify where we're headed in 2019 and beyond. Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC : Great. I'll turn it over to other people. Thanks so much. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Morning, Ricky. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So my first question is around your generic deflation assumptions in the mid-single digits. Sounds like you incorporate sell side and buy side. So can you just give us a little bit more context in terms of what are you seeing in the market right now? And how do you think the pricing will play out throughout the year? Because to your point, you're giving us like more forward-looking thoughts around pricing. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. A couple things. I'd say first of all, as we've mentioned, we thought it was \u2013 the curve was steepest during our first couple quarters of our year. And we've started to see less steep of a decline in our second half. And to us that indicates that there's clearly been some stabilizing in the environment from what again we're seeing as well as what we're hearing from the teams. And so what that means is we would expect to have some tougher compares in our Q1 and Q2 this year. And then we would think the comparisons to the prior year would get better in the second half of the year. So that's the first thing I would say. When we say we're including the buy side and sell side, what we're basically saying is that when we get lower acquisition cost, sometimes that will translate into lower market pricing. And sometimes that's an opportunity for us to take a look at our margins, always keeping in mind our customers and making sure that they can compete in the marketplace and that they have the appropriate generic pricing that they need to have. And so ours is just basically an all-in of what we're seeing from the terms of our ultimate sell price downstream to the customer. So generally, I would say that the good news is what we're seeing is it looks like the market is stabilizing over the last several months. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So my follow-up, I have a follow up on the Medical segment, but also a clarification on what you just said. So first on the generic assumptions, it sounds like you are really thinking about it from a comp perspective in the second half of the year. So it'd be great if you just can confirm that for me. And then on the Medical segment, when you talked about the delay in sales coming from partnership agreements, that are now kind of like starting to pick up, what was it about the relationship that led to that kind of like slow ramp-up? And any lessons that you learned that you think could help you to improve when you sign up these new type of customers? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. So, yeah, on the generics, I would say that again all I'm saying is that since the curve was steeper in the first half of last year, we would expect the comps on generic deflation to be a little tougher in our first half than we would in the second half. And hopefully that answered that. As far as the partnership agreement, I'll mention it and George may have a couple quick comments in. Yeah, I think we've learned a couple different things. No \u2013 I wouldn't say any real concerns. Just generally that sometimes just getting it down on paper and actually getting it signed and all the terms and conditions agreed to just takes a little bit longer than you think. And then sometimes when you're working with the partners, the timing of which they think they'll get approvals, whether it be overseas or in the U.S., just take a little longer than they expected. So it's really more about getting the I's crossed \u2013 T's crossed, I's dotted and these approvals that just slowed it down. But nothing at all that makes us concerned that this isn't the right strategy, isn't going to be a significant portion of what we do. I think customers \u2013 these partners see us as a great go-to-market partner, not only because of our distribution capabilities, but because of our commercialization capabilities with the significant sales activities that we have in place and an excellent sales team. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Ricky, I actually don't have anything to add to that. I think that's exactly the right response. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Morning, Ross. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : So just digging back into the sort of 2019 color that you gave, I'm just trying to sort of back into the underlying profit growth. So you talked about a pretty decent step up in accretion from the Medtronic deal. So an incremental $0.34 in 2019. And obviously you've got some moving parts on the China piece. I mean it seems like the underlying growth is somewhere in the 5% to 6% range. I guess, one, is that right in terms of profit? And if so is it really thinking about sort of the improved results in the second half? And then kind of run rating that into 2019 in both of the underlying businesses? Or is there sort of other assumptions in there to kind of be mindful of as we kind of get into that picture? Again I realize you're not going to give a ton of color. But just maybe broad strokes as how you're thinking about that progression? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. So I think obviously one of the things that we'll see is we really believe that the Pharma Distribution business will be stabilizing. And FY 2019 as we continue to lap some of the headwinds that we've had both in terms of some customer changes as well as generic market pricing, we believe that we're going to continue to see really strong growth in our Specialty business, which its base continues to get larger and larger, so that strong growth becomes more and more meaningful. We won't have any inventory step up for the Patient Recovery business, which as I mentioned that we're targeting to be up to $100 million. Plus we expect to see growth in that business as well as Cordis and other businesses. We have some negative comp, things that we mentioned that were one-timers last year that affect this year that we won't have that noise in the numbers. Overall demand \u2013 we expect base overall demand to continue to grow. We also expect some really nice growth as we've seen this year in our core Med business in \u2013 the post-acute and the distribution services area have done a very nice job in Med this year. And we are excited about them in the future. And then also there's some opportunities with capital deployment. So I would say those are the broad strokes as to why we feel good about where we're headed in FY 2019. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe \u2013 this morning one of your customers was acquired by KKR, but also there was involvement from Walgreens, in PharMerica. I'm sure it's hard to comment. But I guess in those cases, can you just give us a sense for the profile of a customer like that? The sort of materiality to the business? And how you think about risk during these sort of transition periods? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, Ross. Why don't I start? First of all, obviously we just saw the news this morning. And so it is hard to say much, other than that PharMerica has been a customer. And our agreement goes through June of 2018. We've been in an industry that has seen the chess board move around a fair amount. We will occasionally be on the right side of those movements. We'll occasionally be on the wrong side. And that is true for all of us. I would say in the big picture, this is not a material issue for us. But you certainly are seeing an industry that is going through some changes over these last couple years. And we'll probably see more now and again. But we feel like we have a very robust base at this point, strong positioning. And our customer stability is quite high. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thanks very much and good morning. George, I was wondering if you were seeing any changes on the manufacturing side. So any of your contracts that maybe weren't under a fee-for-service relationship previously? Are you seeing any changing in any of the contracting right now on the manufacturing side? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Good morning, Lisa. So I'll do this carefully. Obviously the conversations that we have with our manufacturer partners are proprietary. And we're careful about that. I will say the industry is going through some interesting changes over these last couple years. And so we're trying to make sure that in our conversations with our branded partners, both sides are reflecting those changes. I think Mike sort of captured one of them, which I think is very significant. Which is we're just going to see less and less that is in contingency that is tied to something other than a fee base. So I think directionally we'll see more moving towards a standard fee base. And I think Mike captured that and gave you a little bit of economic sense of that. I would think that trend is going to continue. But by and large I think conversations are productive. I think we are hopefully respected for the value we create. And we have great respect for the partners that we work with on the manufacturing side. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, as I mentioned, we said in 2017 was a little less than 15% was contingent, but we exited at less than 10%. So we would expect our 2018 to be less than 10% to be contingent. And we are continuing as George said to have very productive conversations with some of the folks in that less than 10% bucket. So we'll see where that goes. But I feel very good that we're doing the right things to reduce our exposure there. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: And then my follow-up question, Mike, would just be around the $0.16, where you talked about first seeing customer initiatives on the Pharmaceutical segment. Can you just give me an example? I'm just trying to understand what kinds of things you're doing and then the investments that you're making around your customer segment? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. That's hard to do, so I really can't do that. It's just we have some different discussions that we're doing with various customers that again if we think together with them, that leads to the right type of situation that we find to benefit us in 2019 and beyond, we'll make those investments. And if we don't then we won't make those. And you will see some upside from us for the year related to not making those investments. So I can't really give you more detail than that. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Can you speak to the strength in the Specialty business that you've alluded to? And how should we think about the quarterly progression here? And what's driving that business? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: So let me start. I'd probably say that I don't know that I can give you much about the quarterly progression as it relates to Specialty. Again I think beyond \u2013 Mike may want to just give further color on Q1 that he mentioned. But our Specialty group has just been on a very strong pattern here. I think we've built out a lot of capability. We're clinically very strong. I think our analytics are very strong. And what we've been able to do I think is grow in both our ability to serve more therapeutic areas downstream and create more service offerings for our biopharmaceutical partners on the upstream. And obviously we are also aligning with the trend that's happening in the pharmaceutical and biotech world, which is more products that are being approved and are in development are specialty drugs. So I think we've been \u2013 seven years or eight years ago we made an important turn in the road to really double down in this business. And we've made a few acquisitions. We've done some great things organically to grow. And we've built out some real capability. And we like to see ourselves as a thought leader in the space. So I think it's an encouraging sign, great direction, leadership is strong. And we're thrilled with the team that we've got there. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, I don't see anything lumpy or anything like that happening in Specialty. I think it should be strong, steady growth throughout the year. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. And on potential redeployment of capital following the China exit. As you further diversify kind of your business or have been in recent years, what other verticals have you contemplated, whether it be in contract research services side or alternative (56:25) such as animal health? Anything like that? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, why don't I take that? Qualifying that as it relates to redeployment of any capital that may come in from the China activities, that's one we can't comment on at this point. In terms of where we are strategically and the portfolio, there are areas that we think are very important, most of which we are now competing in and competing very effectively. So I wouldn't say that there is a marked hole in the portfolio. I like where we are on the Pharmaceutical side. I think we touch all channels. I think we touch all of the manufacturing world. And I think our reach is extensive. We said a couple years ago that Specialty needed to be bigger. It is. We said that generics needed to be bigger. It is. I think we're doing the things we need to do there. On the Medical side I think our business at this point is really driven by the value that we can create for our customer base. And if you look at our customers, whether those are an IDN customer or a straight hospital customer or a clinic, our ability to provide a really broad basket of related services and products right now is pretty extensive. So we'll always look for opportunities to increase scale or competitive strength, but I wouldn't point you to a particular area of weakness right now. Again the other piece I'd add is our post-acute work has been really interesting. And I think we're quite strong there. And we sort of took an early position in that space. So I wouldn't say that there's an area to highlight as a weak area, but I think we're on the right paths there. And I think the portfolio looks strong and highly connected. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on generics, I know to Ricky's question earlier, so you're assuming mid-single digit deflation for the full fiscal year. But you also said that you think that it's starting to stabilize. So just parsing the details, I mean are you basically expecting this to turn flat to positive once we anniversary the market disruptions or as we get to the back half of the year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No, I wouldn't say that we would see it going to flat or to the positive. In fact, the history of generics wouldn't indicate that that's typically the case. As we said a few times, we've had a couple years where we did have a net increase, had net inflation in generics. But typically it is a net deflationary environment. So we would assume it to stay in a deflationary environment, just not as extreme as we saw for the first part of this year. And I think that's probably just the best way to summarize it. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : I got you. And then my follow up, you mentioned something about investment in opioid measures. If you don't mind just walking us through what you're thinking of doing there? And then as we've seen this in the press, obviously a lot of focus on you guys and your exposure there. So if you don't mind giving us some color on what you think with all the investigations your exposure is, given what you do for opioid drugs? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Let me do the second part first, and then I'll come to the first part of your question. Some of the basics. We operate a very strong, robust suspicious order monitoring system and process that not only meets our regulatory requirements, we believe it exceeds what is required of distributors. We're doing our part to prevent the diversion of drugs. I would also say though, it is important that everyone do their part in dealing with this issue. I said in my comments earlier that the search for blame is the enemy of the search for solutions. It's something I say often in our organization. But it is especially true in a complex situation like this. What we really need is for all of the stakeholders to work cooperatively and ultimately to address both sides of this issue. And so I think that's important. As it relates to legal cases, I'd just say this. We're going to vigorously defend ourselves. We believe that the lawsuits do not advance the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis. And we are going to do the things that we think are important in the public good to help in a place where we've got some knowledge. And so we are doing this and have been doing this in education. We've talked a lot about our Generation Rx initiative. Some of you know about it. We haven't been that visible in the public about it. But it is actually a really important program in helping to combat drug abuse and misuse. We are working with law enforcement. We're working with educators. We are working on product donations to help in a crisis. We've got takeback strategies. So what we are probably going to be doing in terms of our focus is working in the regions where the \u2013 we're really going to pilot this in regions where it is most acute. And we feel that's very important. So it's an action that we want to take. It will build on the work that we've done. And we think it's important. And we're going to do it. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much. George, could you talk a little bit more about how you view the international opportunity? It seems like on the one hand you're signaling that you're backing away from China at least on the drug distribution side. But on the other hand you're investing on the Medical side with Cordis and Medtronic. So how do you think about international as a growth opportunity going forward? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hey, John. Yeah. Great question. You actually drew a very valuable distinction, important one for us, which is we're looking at \u2013 and I think I've always said this to you as we look internationally. We look at the services part of our business with a different lens than we look at the product side. Let me put it very plainly. We have a big product business. We want to sell those products in every market in the world. Those tend to be opportunities where scale is advantageous to us. It drives manufacturing costs. And there's sort of a virtuous cycle of having that scale. Service businesses transport with greater challenges. It's harder to create value out of service businesses. We entered China because we saw a unique opportunity. We knew it was a business that was in a market that was growing. There was a roll-up that was likely to occur and that we felt we could bring something to that market. And I think that we have. And our teams have done a great job there. They've really grown that business. But I think what we are seeing there is to have the kind of leadership that we seek is going to require a deployment of capital that can be more effectively deployed elsewhere. And so I think it's just for us a question of how quickly and what does it take to achieve that leadership position. And so that's driving our decision in China. But I do think that the distinction that you drew is an important one. We tend to look at product lines and product businesses a little bit differently than we do those service businesses. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then a follow-up for Mike. Can you just talk a bit more about investment scenarios in fiscal 2018? It looks like CapEx is slated to be up significantly. It looks like over 30%. What sort of investments are you planning on making in the coming year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. As far as overall capital deployment, you're right. We would expect CapEx to be, as we said, $500 million to $540 million. We still plan to maintain our dividend policy of a 30% to 35% payout. And as I mentioned, we also committed to pay down about $500 million of debt each year for the next three years. So those are three important things for us in terms of capital deployment. And obviously after that as we always have, we'll continue to look at opportunistic repo and M&A that fits strategically with the business. Specifically as it relates to CapEx, the biggest piece of that is going to be our P-Mod costs that \u2013 continue to make those investments over that multiyear project. And then there's also some dollars that were significant into some of the acquisitions. The Patient Recovery business will have some initial capital that we want to put into our plan for this year, as well as continuing to invest in some of our other recent acquisitions. So those are the biggest ones. And then we'll continue to invest obviously in all of our infrastructure, whether it be our buildings, IT systems, et cetera, at our other businesses that we continue to do across post-acute and specialty, et cetera. But those are a couple of bigger carveouts. Operator : Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and farewell, Sally. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Morning. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You'll be missed by many. Mike, sorry to come back to this. But in your prepared remarks on generic pricing you stated that it remains competitive but seems to be stabilizing. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And maybe we're mincing words here. But when can you declare victory, that it has indeed stabilized? I think to an earlier response you implied it's lapsing of the quarters. But wanted to see if there's something else that we're missing? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would just say this. I'm not sure that you can ever declare \u2013 I wish that I could say on November 15 we ought to be good to go. But that's just not the way it works. I think it ebbs and flows, depending on various things going on in the market. And I think that when you have various launches that happen, multiple players, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it has always ebbed and flowed. That's been the case \u2013 I've been here 27 years now, and I've seen it. I think what we've tried to say is that we're used to dealing with those normal ebbs and flows. What we saw in the late last year and the first half of this year was a little bit more extreme, because there was a lot of noise in the marketplace. And it seemed like those ebbs and flows were just a little bit more extreme. And what we're saying is it's not that it's stabilized in the sense of no competition. It's just that it's going back to what I would call more historical norms. And, George, I don't know if you want to add \u2013 ? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Garen, that's an interesting question. And let me frame it. And it's probably aligned with what Mike was just saying. Historically you see deflation in generics. So in a way victory is just going back to typically our ability to model it very effectively. We actually have been able to model it very effectively. This was the most challenging year for us in terms of being able to predict and model it. It just looked a little different than we had seen. So in some ways victory is actually just knowing that we're seeing patterns that are familiar and that we can model more effectively. And I think that's my version of victory on this one. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. No, that's actually very helpful. And then just moving on to the Medical side of the business. Hospital utilization trends have been weak thus far in the quarter. It doesn't look like it impacted you this quarter. But anything that you've observed? And what are you assuming for fiscal 2018? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, Garen. It's \u2013 yeah. From the data that we've seen, it's relatively flat utilization. I still \u2013 and I think I've said this to a number of you. I do think that in a way that defies gravity \u2013 I mean, we know that demographics are driving more people to need health care. And so I do think what we're seeing, and I think we'll continue this for a while, is some choppiness associated with shifting benefit designs. But ultimately I think demographics will win out. I mean that's the reality. Our business has been growing. I do think our value proposition is resonating perhaps differently than it did three or four years ago. And as a result, we're positioned well with market leaders. And I think our share position is good. So I think we're not assuming a big increase in utilization in our upcoming year. I think we'll continue to assume it's relatively steady as she goes. No major changes. Again, my view is that underlying that there are some issues that are probably going to continue to grow over years. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Let's assume you do sell the business in China. Can you talk about any restrictions on what that cash might be? Can you take it back into the U.S. and buy back stock? Or any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously that's something we are obviously thinking about. And as you can imagine are doing the appropriate planning to do the right things to be able to have access to that cash. So at this point in time I can't say a lot, other than we would not expect to be limited with at least a large portion of any net proceeds that we have. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then for these $0.16 of discrete items, that's in addition to the $0.50 that you mentioned last quarter? Is that correct? And then would any of that $0.16 \u2013 are those like separate discrete projects? Or would some of that potentially be perhaps pricing a bit more aggressively to win new business? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Good question. Really they're two separate things. When I was really talking about the discrete items that were greater than $0.50, I was really trying to call out things that caused FY 2018 to be down from FY 2017. For instance, if you have a discrete tax item that doesn't repeat in 2018 that you had in 2017, then you obviously create a headwind. Or if you have a reserve adjustment that was positive in 2017 that isn't going to repeat in 2018, then those are the types of things I was talking about. So that greater than $0.50 obviously finished a little bit higher, because taxes got a little bit better. And that's why we finished a little higher, which created a little bit more headwind for 2018. So that was that bucket. What I was specifically talking about on the $0.16 plus the $0.06, so a total of roughly $0.22, was where I was really trying to help you bridge our guidance that we gave of $4.85 to $5.10 back to the April early outlook, where we said that we would be down flattish to mid-single digits. And so that $0.22 really helps you reconcile roughly midpoint to midpoint if you look at it of what happened. Because since April we went back and said as we were establishing our budget, what else that we think is important to do? And so first of all \u2013 not really part of the budget \u2013 we finished $0.06 higher, but then we had the other $0.16 as I mentioned is from customer investments we decided to build in that again, if we do not do them, those will be potentially things that we would be able to give back this year in terms of overperformance. But we think those are good investments that we're working through with various customers. I will say those are not just being more aggressive in the marketplace. That's not at all what those would refer to. And then it's some tax planning that we're doing in order to put ourselves in the best position. And then as George mentioned, it's some significant investment into fighting this opioid epidemic that we are planning to do in 2018 that we think is an important thing for us to do as a company to step up. Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think we've \u2013 go ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. And also, Sally... Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Morning, Steve. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I enjoyed the partnering action over the years. And thanks for taking the question here. Just quickly on brands. We heard that one of your peers talk about some pressure in mid-calendar 2017 from just recently converting more branded drug manufacturer contacts to fee for service. So I was just curious if Cardinal made any changes around that in the past several months? And is that playing a role in the near term results and outlook? And then I have a very quick one-line follow-up question. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would say that we can't get into a lot of specifics, but we have been working as I said with some of the suppliers that were in that contingent bucket that had a portion of contingent. And some of those suppliers we have reached new agreements with. And other ones we're still working through with. So that's why I said we went from around 15% to less than 10% now being contingent. Was there a little bit of noise on some of that? There is a little bit of that. Nothing I would call as significant in our 2018 numbers. But yeah, there was a little bit of trade-offs as we worked through with some of those manufacturers. But we feel really good in general about where those came out and some of the other components of the deals that we were able to strike. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And just quickly on Red Oak, you mentioned I think for FY 2018 maybe a little bit less contribution year over year. I'm just curious. Can you remind us just how much the annual payments were from Cardinal to CVS in fiscal 2017 that just ended? And then is that expected to change materially at all in FY 2018? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. The annual payments to CVS are $45.6 million a quarter, and those payments are locked in for the rest of the deal. So there will be no change in the impact of those payments in FY 2018 to FY 2017. But again the value that we're seeing from Red Oak net of those payments continues to be very, very positive. Just quickly because we're running late on time, we're really going to have to make the next question our last one. And then anybody else that didn't get a chance to get in, please, we'll hopefully answer your questions as we do one-on-one calls today or throughout the next several days if you need to get your questions answered. So let's go to the last question. Operator : Our final question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Appreciate you guys sneaking me in, and I'll just limit it to one. Looking at fiscal 2019, the kind of early guidance you guys have given there, obviously pretty unprecedented for Cardinal to be providing guidance two years out when wrapping up the fiscal year. So I guess just maybe, both George and Mike, just a little bit more on the thought process behind this? I would think honestly, given how fluid the environment has been that visibility would be still somewhat limited, especially that far out. So how should we think about your confidence in the drivers behind fiscal 2019? And maybe just the thought process behind kind of taking a step out and providing that to us today? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Bob, thanks. It's a fair question. I think it was important for us as we looked at our business. We have been over these last nine years, we've had moments where we've had to reset, invest, and drive for future plans. I mentioned that during my prepared comments. This is sort of one of these moments. Part of this is the conditions of the market. Part of it is the moves that we've made. We felt as we started looking out at the business, particularly having deployed some capital and some important moves, that it would be valuable for you to understand how we saw those and to sort of lay out our aspirations. And so I think it's partly a way of sort of framing how we see the business and the evolution of the portfolio. You've seen us make \u2013 announce one potential move here in China. Over the last week we've closed another transaction that we think strengthens our business on the product side. So as we talked about it and felt that it would be helpful for us to frame that out for our investors to give you a little bit of sense of our direction, our portfolio, and our sense of optimism going forward. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: All right. Folks, thank you for staying with us. It was I know a long call today. I know there are one or two, maybe three or four of you who did not get a chance to get questions in on the call. We will make sure to be available to you during the day. We look forward to getting a chance to talk with all of you. Thank you all, and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to 1Q FY 2018 Cardinal Health, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead, ma'am. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by George Barrett, Chairman and CEO; Mike Kaufman, CFO; and Jorge Gomez, CFO of the Medical Segment. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties. Today's press releases and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release. We would like to remind you that we will webcast our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders this Wednesday, November 8 at 8 :00 a.m. Eastern time. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit your questions to one with one follow-up so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, feel free to reach out to the IR team after this call with any additional questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Before we turn to the earnings, let me offer a few words about the succession plan we announced today. You all know Mike and I know you can appreciate why the board and I are so pleased that he will succeed me as our next CEO. As our press release said, Mike will take on the CEO responsibilities in January and I will continue to serve as Executive Chairman through the Annual Meeting of Shareholders a year from now in November of 2018. At that time, Greg Kenny, our Independent Lead Director, will assume the role of Cardinal Health's next Chairman. Mike is a veteran of Cardinal Health, having been with us for 27 years. He knows our business inside and out. In addition to serving as our CFO, Mike has held senior leadership positions at both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments and has been instrumental in many of our key strategic initiatives. As everyone here at Cardinal Health knows, Mike lives our mission and embodies our values. He shares my view that it is a privilege and a responsibility to lead our company in service of our customers and their patients as well as the best interest of you, our shareholders. Mike has been a superb partner to me. I'm extremely excited for him and for us and I know that the transition will be seamless. As Mike takes on his new role, we're also delighted that Jorge Gomez, currently CFO of our Medical segment, will succeed Mike as our next CFO. Jorge was a natural choice for this position. He had served as CFO of both of our segments as well as the company's Treasurer and Controller. He brings a deep understanding of our business and global financial experience to his new role. Mike and Jorge will make a great team, and this is a natural evolution of the partnership they've already established. While my role will shift in January, my ongoing commitment to Cardinal Health is deeply felt and unwavering. I look forward to supporting Mike and our board and to spending more time focusing on the public and health policy issues critical to Cardinal Health, our industry and our communities. With that, let's now turn to the performance for the quarter. We're off to a solid start to our fiscal 2018. We'd expected that our first quarter numbers will be down year-over-year. While that was the case, our business performed somewhat better than we had anticipated and we continue to see progress across most of our lines of business. For the first quarter, we achieved revenues of $32.6 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.09 and generated a robust $1.2 billion in operating cash. Our Pharmaceutical segment performed largely as expected. Our Pharma Distribution business did extraordinary work for our customers, particularly in light of the devastating natural disasters that have affected multiple communities around the country, including Texas, Florida, California and, of course, Puerto Rico. And I'll return to this subject later in my comments. As a reminder, our revenue comparison year-over-year was affected by the loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics, which we had previously disclosed. At the end of our fiscal 2017, we noted that the deflation rate on generics seem to be stabilizing. We still hold that view, noting that the rate of deflation is less today than we saw at this time last year, and Mike will touch on this more in his comments. Our Specialty Solutions group continues its robust growth. We've grown to a stage of significant scale, deepening our value proposition as we continue to bring on new biopharma clients and acute care customers. As a result, we are seeing growth both in the downstream provider side and in the upstream biopharma services side. We believe we have a significant value proposition in the specialty space, not only in retail and physician office settings, but also for large acute care and IDN customers who are increasingly responsible for these critical medications. Turning to our Medical segment, the team had a solid start to the year. As expected, our numbers this quarter were adversely affected by the year-over-year comparisons associated with the previously disclosed loss of a large portion of a VA contract. We do, however, continue to see good growth across many lines of business, specifically our naviHealth, Cardinal Health at-Home, Kitting and Lab businesses performed particularly well, and our strategic account work continues to grow as we become increasingly valuable to our partners. The Cordis business performed as we expected this quarter. We continue to make progress building out our product portfolio, most recently, signing an agreement with Medinol where Cordis has exclusive distribution rights in the U.S. to their coronary stent portfolio, including a drug-eluting stent upon FDA approval. We are also distributing the Tryton Side Branch Stent to treat bifurcation lesions. This is the first dedicated bifurcation device to receive regulatory approval in the U.S. Finally and, quite significantly, we closed the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business this quarter and our integration work is off to an excellent start. Our sales forces have been combined and realigned and product training across the group is going extremely well. We are seeing great opportunities to create mutual value between historical product lines and channels of Cardinal Health and these new product lines and channels that have come to us through this acquisition. We are thrilled to have our new colleagues on board. They've shown great enthusiasm as they've joined the Cardinal Health family. It would be incomplete to have a conversation with you without addressing the drug abuse issue that is affecting this nation. Cardinal Health continues to take an active role in the dialogue and the hard work associated with helping to tackle this national crisis. As I've said before, this is an issue that is large, it is complicated and, most important, it is tragic and personal. I believe most of you know that we have spent nearly a decade continuously enhancing our best-in-class suspicious order monitoring tools and analytics to keep pace with the ever-changing shape of this crisis, but we've been doing much more than this. Because we know that professional training and prevention education is critically important in this area, we've committed heavily to this. Over the last nine years, we have been proactively educating pharmacists and students through our Generation Rx program, which was created in conjunction with the Ohio State School of Pharmacy. To-date, our Generation RX materials have been used by more than 1 million people. We've been working for many months on ways to expand this successful program to provide emerging physicians training, expanded drug take-back programs and in coordination with local law enforcement, a Narcan distribution strategy for the emergency treatment of a known or suspected opioid overdose. As a wholesale distributor, we do not manufacture, promote, market or prescribe these drugs. We do, however, take very seriously our responsibilities to serve our health care system. Our anti-diversion systems and controls are substantial, they are well-funded and they are best-in-class. I'm enormously proud of the work that our people do in their communities to help phase down the challenges of the misuse and abuse of prescription medications. I've never worked with an organization so mission-driven, which brings me to the recent natural disaster we've seen in various parts of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We have more than 8,700 colleagues across Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Florida, Texas and California. They have been truly heroic in the work they've done and continue to do to assist in emergency relief efforts and to serve our customers and the health care needs of their patients, particularly at a time when many of them are personally vulnerable or affected. Our employees have also generously supported one another through our Cardinal Health Foundation employee assistance fund to provide financial support to the Cardinal Health families affected by these storms. Related to this, I'd like to share a quick story with you. Last week, the leader of our Puerto Rico organization shared with me that not only did we have an overwhelming percentage of our employees working within 24 hours after the hurricane hit, but that our people and our operations served as the key logistics provider in collaboration with HHS, the CDC, the local Department of Health as well as several NGOs. Given our capabilities and footprint, we were in a unique position to provide aid even on products and in areas we don't typically serve. The sense of community that permeates our colleagues on the islands has been inspiring. As one colleague said to me, Cardinal Health values are not a plaque on a wall somewhere. They live right here in what we are doing every day to help each other and our customers here in Puerto Rico. It's difficult to find a way to adequately thank them for their extraordinary and heroic work. This is an untold story, but this is the Cardinal Health that I see every day and of which I am so proud to be a part. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the kind words, George. I'll also share a few brief comments before we get into the financial results for the quarter. Let me start by saying how excited I am to take on this new responsibility. I've been with Cardinal Health for 27 years and, as you can imagine, this company, our people and our mission are very important to me. It's an extraordinary honor to be selected to succeed George as CEO and I am grateful for the trust and confidence that the Board of Directors is placing in me. Given the close partnership George and I have had over the past nine years, I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition as I will continue to benefit from George's valuable perspective and ongoing contributions as Executive Chairman. The strategic steps we've taken this year and over the past several years put us in a strong position for the future. I believe that we are well-aligned with the trends in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments of the health care industry. I don't expect to be making dramatic changes to what we've built and we'll certainly plan to take full advantage of the many opportunities that our robust portfolio has to offer. While there'll always be challenges, I feel very good about how the company is competitively positioned and believe we are on the right track. I also want to say how excited I am that Jorge Gomez will become our new CFO. We have worked closely together for many years and I am glad to have a partnership with Jorge similar to the one I have enjoyed with George. Jorge brings a depth of experience and I'm thrilled he has accepted the role of CFO. Finally, I just want to say that one of Cardinal Health's great strengths is the enormously talented and dedicated team of professionals we have in place. Together with our team, I look forward to building on our strong foundation while always keeping in sight our ultimate goal of supporting our partners in the critical work they do each and every day serving patients and their families. With that, let me turn to the review of our financial performance for the first quarter. As always, the financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide seven of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the first quarter. Overall, our first quarter fiscal 2018 results came in ahead of our plan. Operating income was somewhat ahead of expectations due mainly to the timing of certain expenses. Diluted EPS of $1.09 benefited from share count and the timing of a few discrete tax items. Revenues increased 2% year-over-year totaling $32.6 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 5% to $1.7 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year. Given our recent acquisitions, most notably the Patient Recovery business, our consolidated SG&A increased 15% versus the prior year, as expected. Consolidated operating earnings were $610 million, a 9% decline versus the prior year. This was affected by the inventory step-up in the Medical segment, which I will cover in greater detail later on. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in as expected at $83 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 34.1%, a 2.3 percentage point decline versus the prior year. During the quarter, we did see a couple of small favorable discrete tax items. As we have stated in the past, the quarterly effective tax rate will have some variability. We still expect our full year tax rate to be unchanged from our plan. Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 318 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We had $150 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and we have about $300 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Our operating cash flow for the quarter came in strong at $1.2 billion. If you recall, in our fourth quarter, the operating cash flow reflected the impact of nearly $400 million of vendor payments that were made early due to some changes during the Pharma IT refresh implementation. As expected, this impact was recaptured in the first quarter and contributed to our strong operating cash flow performance. Given that we benefited from this and other timing items, we still expect annual cash flow to be in line with our original expectation. Our cash balance at September 30 was $1.2 billion with roughly $600 million held outside the United States. The reduction from our fourth quarter cash balance reflects the funding of the Patient Recovery acquisition in July. Now let's move to segment performance. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 1% to $28.9 billion. This increase was due to sales growth from Specialty and Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which was partially offset by the previously announced loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics, which George mentioned in his comments. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 13% to $467 million, in line with our expectations and what we shared on the fourth quarter call. This was driven by our generics program performance and the cost related to the ongoing investment in our Pharma Distribution IT refresh project. This project, which we refer to internally as P-Mod, is progressing well and is on time and on budget. As an additional reminder, our generics program includes the benefit of Red Oak Sourcing as well as Pharmaceutical pricing and volume changes. Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which came in largely as planned. Revenues for the quarter grew 14% to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 1% to $129 million during the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the contribution from the Patient Recovery acquisition net of the inventory step-up. This was mostly offset by a reduced contribution from the previously announced loss of a large portion of a VA contract. The Patient Recovery acquisition, which closed on July 29, was successfully on-boarded and performed operationally in line with our expectation. As I just noted, performance in the quarter included a $42 million inventory step-up. Excluding this, the Medical segment profit growth would have been 34%. While we have yet to finalize the inventory step-up calculation, our current estimate is that the remaining step-up to be recorded in Q2 will not exceed what we saw in the first quarter, which is in line with our expectations. With regards to Cardinal Health brand, the majority of our product lines performed as expected in the quarter. However, we did see some supply and commodity challenges, primarily in our exam glove business. Before moving to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, you can turn to slide number seven where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the quarter. The $0.73 variance was primarily driven by two factors. First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs were $0.40 in the quarter. This includes all acquisitions closed as of September 30. Note that the year-over-year increase is a result of the Patient Recovery acquisition. Historically, we've utilized third-party distribution partners to help get our products to market in countries where we haven't had a sales force and back office infrastructure. With the Patient Recovery and Cordis acquisitions, we now have a platform to distribute directly. Consequently, we deployed $125 million to regain direct distribution of our self-manufactured surgeon gloves in certain markets. This charge is reflected in the $0.27 in restructuring and employee severance. Now let's talk briefly about total year financial assumptions on slide 9 and 10. First, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.10. With respect to quarterly cadence, we still expect the first and second half to be as we originally modeled. Consequently, the timing benefit in the first quarter should reverse in the second quarter. Second, given the recent share repurchases I referenced earlier, we are revising our full share count projection to 318 million to 319 million shares. And, finally, we are updating the guidance for amortization and acquisition-related intangibles to $560 million to include acquisitions that closed in our first quarter, most notably Patient Recovery. Our Pharma segment assumptions on slide 11 remain on target and unchanged. However, let me give you a little more color on our generic and brand assumptions. Based on our first quarter, generic deflation is trending as expected. Remember that our generic deflation calculation is a year-over-year point-to-point measurement of average selling price. We recognize that companies measure this differently. We continue to believe that we have appropriately risk-adjusted our assumption for the year. In addition, as it relates to brand inflation, while it is still early in the year, we remain comfortable with our full year assumptions. Furthermore, if actual inflation falls below this assumption, we expect it can be absorbed within our EPS guidance range given that over 90% of our contracts are now fee-for-service. Our Medical segment assumptions for fiscal 2018 can be found on slide 12 where we have no updates to report. We continue to feel we are well-positioned, especially with the recent on-boarding of the Patient Recovery business. To close, with one quarter behind us, we feel good about our overall positioning and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I'm going to turn the call back to George. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Before I turn to Q&A, I'd like to say a few words about Cardinal Health's unique value proposition in today's rapidly evolving health care landscape. Our health care supply chain capabilities are second to none, but being truly essential to care requires much more than that. We possess a unique set of skills and industry knowledge, which when combined with our significant scale and a portfolio that spans the entire health care continuum, ideally positions us for continued leadership in the health care system. For example, we provide a wide range of critical services, negotiating on our customer's behalf to secure highly regulated drugs from around the world, working for them to secure inclusion in restricted networks, providing clinical pharmacy support and medication therapy management. We also provide population health tools to identify optimal pathways for post-acute care, medical product knowledge and scale to allow medical providers to standardize their product selection and utilization, and performance improvement services that reduce waste, improve efficiency and increase patient safety. These jobs require deep understanding of the health care system, of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies and this in-depth knowledge of an extremely complex regulatory framework. This expertise combined with our relationships and understanding of the intricacies of how health care is delivered has been honed by a team of thousands of professionals here at Cardinal Health over the past many decades. Furthermore, we have built our portfolio with the conviction that our ability to provide solutions on both the medical and pharmaceutical delivery of care would be uniquely valuable to the system. This is why we remind you that while we are organized in reporting segments, we often go to market as a broad suite of solutions across the enterprise. And this is why we are so confident that Cardinal Health will continue to grow while playing a vital role in health care. Before we get to the Q&A, I want to express my deepest thanks to all of you and the investment community for your support, confidence and input over the years. I also want to thank our people, 50,000 strong around the world for the amazing work they do every day, living our mission as they serve our customers and their patients. I'm honored and humbled by their dedication. With that, let's now turn to the Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Now we will take our first question from Ms. Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, ma'am. Your line is now open. Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa this morning. Just a couple of questions. With respect to the outlook, I was just hoping you could talk about some of the key factors that could drive the fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS. I understood you uppered the lower end of the guidance range. And then just as a follow-on to that, last quarter, you previously discussed a target of at least $5.60 in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2019, just wanted to know if you had any comment on that at this point. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. A couple things. First of all, as far as FY 2019 goes, that was just some early guidance that we gave and we are not planning on updating that at this time. As we get through our work early in our Q3 and Q4 and when more appropriate, we'll come out with some further guidance and thoughts around FY 2019. As far as opportunities and risk in our FY 2018 guidance, I would start with the good news, first being is I don't see anything at this time that would be a huge mover in either direction, but I do see some things that I would probably say fit in the category of opportunities, risk and things that can maybe go either way. As far as the opportunities, I would say share count is in the opportunity. Some of the over-performance that we've seen in the Pharma segment in Q1 and part of that being our Specialty division, I could see that to continue throughout the year. And we're seeing some excellent performance in our post-acute solutions business and could continue to see that to possibly be an opportunity for the year. As far as risks go, I would say that our Cardinal brand products area has some risks, and that's really, to what I mentioned in my script, around the exam gloves. We are seeing some commodity and supply issues in that particular area, so that could be a little bit of a risk to the year. If our China exit happens sooner than we expected, as I mentioned, we said we have it in for the full year, if that were to get done and approved and exited before the end of the year, that could have a little downside risk. And then, of course, while we don't believe it from everything we're hearing, if the medical device tax were brought back, that could be a negative. And then the things that I would say could go either way, effective tax rate was favorable in Q1. We expect to see puts and takes all year. So we still feel comfortable with our full year guidance, but that could always go a little bit either direction. The Pharma pricing around generic ASP deflation, that could be a positive or maybe, if it gets a little worse could be a negative. Timing and magnitude of the customer initiatives that I mentioned in the first quarter, those are with existing customers. As I've stressed before, we continue to see good progress in those discussions, but have not finalized anything there. And so depending on how that goes, that could be a little bit of potential upside or maybe a little bit of down. And then finally, the Patient Recovery performance, again, we feel really good about that, but it's early. And so, all of those things I would say could go either way, but I want to stress none of them we see as significantly concerned that they would be a large driver one direction or the other. Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Appreciate all the detail. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Absolutely. Next question. Operator : And our next question is from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And my congrats to Mike and Jorge on the new roles. And, George, it's been obviously a pleasure working with you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So just I want to go back to some things you guys talked about last quarter. You discussed $0.16 of investments related to customer initiatives and investments in tax and opioid prevention. But on the customer investment specifically, I was wondering if you guys had an update on that opportunity both on the cost side and maybe when you could come to an agreement or be in a position to communicate around what those investments were specifically related to. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. So I would say the tax planning initiative is going as planned. The opioid one was one of the timing items that we're really talking about that we expected to be spend some of that in Q1, and we see that more as the expenses being spent in Q2, which is why we have a little bit of upside in Q1 over our expectations. But then specifically to your question around in customer investment, again, those discussions continue to go well. Nothing has been finalized there. We would expect that those discussions would probably have clarity by the end of our Q2. And at that time, at our next earnings release, we think we ought to be able to give folks some clarity around whether or not there's some upside to this year if those don't happen or whether we've decided to expand upon those and do anything. But right now, I'm more anticipating that those will be about as planned or would provide some upside if they don't actually happen this year. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just on the Pharma segment, your margins came in better than at least we were expecting. But there's, obviously, still a lot of debate in the market around generic pricing and some of the recent data points I would say from the generic manufacturers would probably point to a worsening environment. I know you guys have talked about this in the past, but could you maybe just give us an update on what you saw with regard to generic pricing in the quarter both from a buy-side and sell-side perspective? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Bob. Good morning. Let me start and then I will turn it to Mike. As we said in the comments, if you compared where we are today to a year ago, the rate of deflation is less dramatic. So we had seen some stabilizing of that rate as we came to the end of the fiscal year for us. And I would say that that continued. It is always difficult to comment on others observations about price because as a manufacturer, you've got your own portfolio, which is actually unique to those products. And as you know, various of us who report publicly actually use different methodologies. But ours has been consistent, as Mike said, on a point-to-point basis. And so we feel fairly good about our forecast for the year. But maybe, Mike, you can jump in on that. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add is, as I've mentioned before in both my prepared remarks and before is our discussion of how we describe generic deflation is the point-to-point year-over-year related to the average selling price. And everything that we see that we're forecasting for the current year still would say that our assumption of mid single-digits down would still be accurate. And I've also said in the past the other important thing is not only how you see your selling price, but also how you're doing on the costing side. And for us, that is, obviously, mainly Red Oak, and Red Oak continues to perform at or above our expectation. So we feel good on both sides, both from a selling standpoint and a costing standpoint, which they both need to work out for you to get where you want to be, and we feel good about both of those at this point in time. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Absolutely. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is actually Liza on for Ricky this morning. Just a quick one. So we're fielding a lot of questions around Amazon. Can you maybe provide your thoughts on how you see Amazon in terms of maybe competition on the medical supply side? And do you see an opportunity to work with Amazon if they were maybe to try and enter the drug supply chain? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, so... George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hey, Liza, let me just \u2013 it's sort of broad issue for us. As I've said in past calls, we never dismiss any competitor or a potential competitor. It's something we always take seriously. I think the thing that is worth noting if you think about the comments that we made during the course of the call today is the nature of what we actually do. And so we're sort of this critical interface between a highly regulated system of providers, manufacturers and a regulatory system. And so I think the heart of our competitive profile is really our ability to serve the health care system with a very complex and important suite of products and services that they need in order to be health care companies and providers. And I think that's at the heart of what we do. So it's very difficult to describe how we see that competitive landscape. We basically know what we do and what our value proposition is. As to working with them, at this point, we work very closely with our providers, our manufacturer partners. There's no particular plan right now to do anything distinctly with them, but our primary goal and our focus is making sure that we create value for all of these customers with products and services that they very much need in order to do their work for patients. Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. I'm curious kind of how you're maybe applying some of the lessons you learned from Cordis on the Medical side of the business and what you can leverage or apply to the Medtronic patient protection business that you acquired. Can you kind of give us an update on the integration process? And any sort of surprises in the initial days there? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Good morning, Erin. It's George. I'll start and then I'll turn it to Mike. I think every integration is its own learning experience. And I think, for us, the Cordis integration required a lot of international work, some of which we had people on the ground doing and in other places we had to build that out. We also had to do some work in that integration with a third-party, which is the partner that sold us the product line. So that requires a lot of interfaces, moving parts and great disciplines. And I think we've, over the course of the year, honed that increasingly. I think Don and his team have done a great job in the Patient Recovery business of planning well ahead, of thinking carefully about that integration and of leveraging the work that we've already done, particularly outside of the U.S. So I think each one of these is an opportunity for growth and learning. And I think Don and team have done that extremely well. We're off to a really good start. Mike, I'll let you jump in there. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I would say a couple things. Part of the learnings from the Cordis acquisition that we applied to the Patient Recovery business is not only around the execution things that we knew that we had to put the right things in place, but also about estimating what those costs would be. And so, as we gave our guidance and thoughts around Patient Recovery, we took a lot of those learnings, such as the amount of startup cost it would take, the amount of SG&A that we would need to put into the business to make sure that we were estimating those right so that we were giving the appropriate guidance around that business. So I feel really good about what we put out there as our goals from a financial perspective for the Patient Recovery business, but also on the learnings on the execution standpoint. So whether it be in the area of managing inventory or working through the SG&A cost structure or whether managing the PSAs with our partner, in this case, Medtronic, I think the team is working well on all of those. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on P-Mod, just your efforts there, do you think they're running ahead of plan? Or how should we be thinking about kind of the recurring nature of some of those incremental investments? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. As related to P-Mod, I would say things are going really well. We're on time and on budget on that project. The Pharma team is doing an excellent job of managing the cost, managing the scope, putting the right talented people on that project to deliver. So it's going really well. As far as the cadence for P-Mod goes, as we've mentioned before, we expected to be a headwind in our Q1. As we just said, we expect it to be a headwind in our Q2 just from a year-over-year expense standpoint with some of the implementations that we did last year going live, it creates depreciation expense this year, and then we expect it to become essentially neutral in our Q3 and our Q4. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for questions. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks very much. Two quick ones in Medical. The first one, to regain control of the exam gloves internationally, you had, obviously, a sizable outflow. Are there going to be other outflows for other product lines? Or how do you treat other product lines ex-U.S. in terms of regaining control of distribution? Second of all, and this is for Mike. Mike, you know I've talked about this, I'm still a little concerned about Medical revenue for the year, with the VA loss, the slow market, annualizing Kaiser, various challenges that have been brought up. Can you just be more specific on what your interpretation of high-teens revenue growth is, what that range is, in your mind? And just make sure we all understand how broad that range is. That's it. Thanks so much. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Eric. I'll start on the first one and maybe Mike can take the second one and we'll sort of tag team this. The move that we made to regain the rights in Europe really was very specific to an old agreement. That really was a reflection of the product line that we had some years ago. And so, these are a series of products for which we had no commercial operations ex-U.S. and so we depended on third-parties to do that. And so now that we have operations in virtually all of these countries, it was very logical for us to want to have the rights back to be able commercialize our own product. So it was specific to a set of products. There's nothing else to be forthcoming as it relates to other products, but we were able to close off this sort of legacy agreement and glad that we're going to be able to commercialize our own products. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. And that was really \u2013 our surgeon gloves, which is what we manufacture ourselves and have just an excellent reputation and an outstanding quality and acceptance throughout both the U.S. and overseas. It was really the one product that we were selling significant amounts overseas. Now, obviously, with the addition of Cordis and Patient Recovery and commercial operations overseas, we plan to sell other products of ours that we feel really good about, but that was really the only one that we had significant sales that would create any type of restructuring charge like that. As far as Medical revenue goes, I really can't say more than the fact that we still feel good about the high-teens revenue growth \u2013 percentage increase in revenue for this year. Our early looks at the Patient Recovery business, while the first couple weeks were a little variable; after the first couple weeks, the business has looked very much as we expected for the year and the team is doing an excellent job. So, to your point, well, I have mentioned the VA is a significant year-over-year headwind, we still feel really good about our high-teens guidance. Thanks. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks and from myself also, Mike, congrats, and George, pleasure working with you. I had a question following up on Bob's question earlier. When we think about the generic deflationary comments we're hearing from manufacturers and then we also look at the market data. When we, as investors, and when we're looking at this, what do you think is a better guide to look at externally besides, obviously, your comments on what you're seeing directly as we try to evaluate your comments and those of others? Do you feel that the aggregate market data is reflective \u2013 is more broadly reflective, or is there any limitation to that? How should we kind of handicap the comments coming from different \u2013 or the data sources that we can get our hands on it? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question. Yeah, this was tough because really or anybody that really understand the impact on our financials or probably any distributor's financials is really have to understand both sides, both how you're affecting your sell price and your cost side. And, for us, to give exact numbers and guidance on both of those is probably not smart from a competitive standpoint. So we have always tried to give \u2013 as you know, our definition is really around the sell side of this. And so, to me, I think you have to look at both. I think you have to look at what we are saying from the standpoint of what we expect our sell price erosion to be and then you have to take a look at what the manufacturers are reporting because those are probably good indicators of what we're able to do on the costing side. And that when you look at the difference between our sell price going down less than what we're able to get on the costing side as a percentage, then that's probably the indicator that we could see a positive move, and that's what we're seeing this year is that we're seeing a nice balance between what's happening on the sell side versus what's happening on our cost side. George, would you...? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Charles, I guess that you've been doing this a long time so you know the challenges of using public data. And I think the way I've heard you describe it is what I think has to be done. You sort of have to triangulate between all the various inputs. There are a lot of moving parts on this, but we'll try to be transparent with you about what we see in our numbers. And then to the extent that we can, we'll give color on the tone of the market. But I think you're right in pointing out that it's very difficult to get a perfect signal from public data. You have to work across multiple sources and triangulate. But we understand and we know \u2013 again, we have been at this a long time, as have you, I would say. It's always a challenging thing to get precise numbers. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate that. And just to be clear, right, I mean, Mike, if I understand what you're saying is that when we think about manufacturer comments, all things being equal, that's really your acquisition cost of drugs. And as long as you're not \u2013 it's not 100% passed through to your sell side margin, we're actually earning money on that deflationary comments. Is that fair? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: That's right. And, remember, the cost is coming off of a lower base because your cost is lower than your sell. So the percentage decline off of the sell is going to be from a dollar standpoint worth more than a percentage \u2013 the same percentage decline off of a cost. And that's why you want to see a spread between the two \u2013 between what you're saying on sell versus cost and that's what we feel good about at this point in time. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. I will leave it there. Thanks a lot. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. And, Mike, congratulations. And, George, for someone who's known you since the Teva days, good luck, and it's been a pleasure talking with you for all these years. Guys, any update on the $0.16 of EPS spend? I know you obviously kept your guidance the same. So I'm assuming that, but is there any update on when we might get some more visibility on that? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Again, three components of that on the $0.16. One was the spend on the opioid piece, which I mentioned earlier is one of the timing, things where we expected a chunk of that spend to happen in Q1. And we're really now more ramping it up in Q2. So we really saw no spend to speak of in Q1 and we expect it to happen in Q2. So we still expect the full year impact of that to be what we thought, it's just the timing move from Q1 to Q2. As far as the tax initiatives we put in place, those are in place, those are delivering what we expected and was built into our guidance for the year. And as far as the customer initiatives, again, we're continuing to have good discussions, and these are, again, with existing customers, which is important to know. And it's still too early for me to call it on that, but I would expect that we would have some clarity by the end of our Q2 that we would be able to communicate to folks on that. So, no change in how those will impact our guidance for the year at this time. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. A quick question on Red Oak. There's been some sort of \u2013 some debate amongst investors and myself with regards \u2013 given now that we have WBAD and Claris One are all out there and the Big Three are purchasing a huge chunk of the generics in the marketplace. Can Red Oak continue to grow? And if so, is it simply doing what they're doing now or would they expand into other products like OTC or other opportunities outside of the U.S.? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think, first of all, I would just say our relationship with CVS continues to be incredibly strong and our interactions at the board level and working together have been incredibly positive. So, yes, we think Red Oak is an absolute asset, not only in the generics side and something that we still feel will continue to deliver incremental value year-over-year as the years continue on it, but also we'll constantly look at that asset, both of us as two companies, and determine if there's other opportunity. So, little too early to say what those might be, but it's absolutely on our mind to always think about what could we do to continue to create benefits for both Cardinal and CVS. Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Absolutely. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Kevin. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I guess, circling back to Amazon real quick. They've been in the more low-end medical supply business for years and, I guess, more recently began into getting more complex regulated devices and supplies. I guess, could you provide any color on if you've started to bump into them with any particular provider type or any particular product category? And then, I guess, a follow-up to that is thinking more long term, when you have a competitor that, obviously, largely competes on being the lowest cost provider, what are the strategies that Cardinal can pursue in order to maintain and grow the relationships with existing customers? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Good morning, Bryan. Bryan, it's George. I'll take this. So I described in my commentary a little bit about the work that we do. Let me start with actually answering the first part of the question, which was, do we bump into them, have we seen them, and the answer is not really. Again, we know that they've been talking about health care to some extent and, obviously, we follow that. But in terms of practical impact, it's not something that we see on a daily basis. I think the key for us is the value proposition, what do we actually do, and I described some of the activities in my commentary earlier. But just sort of filling the blanks in some of the things that we do, Red Oak, our ability to source global generics across the world probably at unprecedented scale to understand that regulatory framework, to link our work in our Specialty business with the connection between the pharmaceutical manufacturer, their innovation on the science side and a very distinct customer need on the downstream side, work that we're doing in the continuum of care as we see these transitions of care and helping IDN direct patients to the optimal site of care, our ability to aggregate demand across hospitals to provide scale and consumables at great efficiency, our work in terms of working across their networks. These are all very distinct health care capabilities and they really reside here at Cardinal. They've been residing here for decades and we just continue to build on those things. So that's really at the heart of what we do. And I think that, in some ways, is the best protection and the best insurance as it relates to our value proposition and we're very excited about the work that we do in that regard. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: The only thing I would add is even on the area where I think people think is just pick, pack and ship and where we would compete, just think about the things we do on that area besides all the value-added that George has been talking about because we are talking about delivering in pellet loads, truckloads, large quantities, managing formularies, 24/7/365 emergency shipments. We're tied to their systems electronically, the past invoicing and help them build per department and all those types of things as well as managing all the regulatory. So, even in what I think people think are the basic areas of pick, pack and ship that the playing field may be leveled, we don't even think they are even leveled in those areas for what we do. And I would say that we're incredibly cost-effective, so I don't think the assumption that they would be more the lowest cost provider when you look at the infrastructure we have in place every day to deliver to our customers, I feel really good about our cost position also. Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more call. Operator : And our next question is from John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks very much, George and Mike. Just a question about the Medical business broadly. Can you maybe speak to the volume trends you're seeing across acute versus ambulatory versus home? How is that trending versus your expectations? George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, John. Good morning. So I think we've said this before. It's a little bit difficult at times to get a good demand signal on utilization, part of it because what we're seeing is some shifting sites and also market-to-market variation. So we have customers who are gaining share and others that are losing. In general, the trend that we've seen is one that we should expect, which is more care moving to ambulatory settings. Having said that, we do have some of our IDN customers that are actually having pretty strong volume in their hospital setting, so it really varies from hospital to hospital. But, in general, I would say we feel fairly good about what we're seeing on the demand side. Now, again, we are probably gaining some share over these last two years. And Don and the team have done a good job of really providing that value proposition that seems to be encouraging some of our customers to want to grow more with Cardinal Health. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add and I think George said it right there is that just be a little helpful generally, as George said, in the acute space, it's really dependent on the customer, but generally in the flattish area. But we are seeing, say, low to mid single-digits in the ambulatory care space and in the home space where the care is shifting. And the nice thing is that we're highly represented in all three of those spaces. So, as share does move between those three, we're able to take advantage of that with our broader set of offerings. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And maybe just one quick follow-up relating to the Patient Recovery business. So I think that was a business that was kind of flat to down a little bit and, obviously, you guys think you can grow it better as being part of your portfolio. So, are you willing to maybe quantify the step-up in growth that you think you can have on the asset and just how you intend to do that? Thanks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, John. I won't quantify that for you. That's not something we can do at this point and it's obviously very early. I will say that the key for us is building that product line into now a very broad product line of products and services. And so we think the opportunity to create value between our historical product lines and channels and theirs is really palpable. As an example, they're much stronger in long-term care historically than we've been. That opens up doors for us and so we see those opportunities. And I think for us also we have product lines inside that business that will fold very naturally to sort of the economic model that we deliver, and there are other products that are much more clinically attribute-driven and our product teams know how to do that really well. So I think we're extremely excited about the fit into our portfolio and I think the ability to leverage our channels is really the opportunity here. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : That will conclude today's questions-and-answer sessions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks. George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Look, I know it's been a busy morning for all of you. So thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We'll look forward to talking with you as the day and the days unfold, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Cardinal Health, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez.

As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional question. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mike Kaufmann. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we report on Cardinal Health's performance for the second quarter. I'll begin with an overview of the results and then touch on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then, Jorge will provide further details in his remarks. Having worked with Jorge for many years, I couldn't be happier to have him as my partner and our CFO. Before we turn to the quarter, though, I'd like to take a moment to thank George Barrett. As you know, I took on the CEO role on January 1. We have had an incredibly smooth transition, and we look forward to George's continued guidance and contributions as Executive Chairman. Also, I am excited that Jon Giacomin has assumed leadership of our Medical segment, and we're thrilled to have him in his new role. Jon is a veteran of Cardinal Health with a proven track record as an operator. His knowledge of our customers, enterprise strategy and focus on execution will be invaluable in his new capacity. I'd also like to thank Don Casey for his contributions to Cardinal Health and we all wish him well in his new endeavor. Let's now turn to the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with the results. Performance across the vast majority of the business was at or above plan, and this translated into the numbers, with 6% revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit of tax reform, of $1.31, ahead of our expectations. Among the highlights this quarter was the Pharmaceutical segment performance, where results were better than expected. And in the Medical segment, the Patient Recovery, at-Home, and naviHealth businesses all performed well. On the flip side, we have some work to do in a couple of discrete areas, specifically in exam gloves and at Cordis, and we are on it. Turning first to the Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 5%, driven by better-than-expected results in Pharmaceutical Distribution and continued strong performance in the Specialty and Nuclear businesses. Generic market pricing continues to trend as expected and Red Oak has continued to perform very well, delivering better-than-planned results on the cost side. I continue to be impressed with the talent, strategies and execution of the Red Oak Sourcing team and appreciate their partnership. On the brand side, I am pleased to report that based on both Q2 results and increases we saw in January, brand inflation remains in line with our expectations. And finally in Specialty, with another strong quarter, this business remains on track to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the year. So in sum, I'm very pleased with the results of the Pharmaceutical segment. In the Medical segment, we also delivered solid performance across most of the business. Revenue was up 19% for the quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of the Patient Recovery acquisition. In addition, we saw growth in our new and existing customers reflecting the appeal of our differentiated offer. In fact, we achieved sales growth in all product categories except exam gloves. This was our first full quarter with the Patient Recovery business having closed the transaction last summer. We are thrilled with the job our new associates around the world are doing. The integration is on track and we are excited about the long-term potential of this business. As I noted, we also saw excellent results from services, Cardinal Health at-Home and naviHealth. In fact, all of these businesses were up double digits for the quarter, driven by growing demand and solid execution. While most of the Medical segment performed well, we did see some challenges in exam gloves where, as we previously discussed, commodity pricing and supply disruptions have created headwinds. We're actively exploring avenues to minimize this impact in the future. Also, at Cordis, the good news is we continue to generate top-line growth. However, profitability has been softer than we expected, reflecting higher than anticipated cost as Jorge will address. As a result, we now anticipate Cordis results to be lower than previously expected for the balance of the year. Let me assure you that Jon Giacomin and Pat Holt, the new leader of Cordis, are already on this and working with the team to improve the performance and produce the kind of results we believe Cordis is capable of. As you know, this is a higher-margin business for us, and once we address the current challenges, we expect to see meaningful leverage as we grow sales. I would also note that we are excited about the recent FDA approval of our partner Medinol's innovative drug-eluting stent for the treatment of patients with narrowing or blockages to their coronary arteries. In January, the first commercial cases using the stent in the United States were implanted successfully. As Medinol's distribution partner, Cordis can now provide this novel stent and delivery system as part of our interventional vascular portfolio for customers. This is a significant addition to the portfolio and Cordis remains committed to bringing new technologies like this to the market to provide even more treatment options for clinicians and their patients. Let's turn now to our outlook. For the full fiscal year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.40 to $5.25 to $5.50 to reflect the benefits of U.S. tax reform. While the following items net to zero, this revised outlook includes better-than-expected performance in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower expectations for the Medical segment due to Cordis and exam gloves and a $0.05 impact from the sale of our China distribution business, which was completed on February 1. Jorge will cover the details of all of this in a few minutes. Having grown the China business over the past seven years, the timing was right for this transaction. To be a market leader in China and get the type of returns we expected, we recognized that significant scale was required. Shanghai Pharma brings the strength and scale necessary to position that business to better meet the needs of patients throughout China. We appreciate all of the good work that was done by our talented team in China to build this business, which is now poised for further growth. As we announced, the gross proceeds from the transaction are $1.2 billion and the net proceeds are approximately $800 million. We will be evaluating the use of the proceeds as well as the benefits from tax reform as part of our overall capital allocation strategy. We remain very committed to the balanced capital allocation process that we have followed for many years. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the business to ensure that we have sustainable growth and we will continue to carefully manage our short and long-term debt obligations. At the same time, we have a differentiated dividend that is very important to us and we always look at strategic M&A opportunities. In addition, we have a track record of utilizing share repurchases to return cash to shareholders at appropriate times. Toward that end, as you saw in our press release issued this morning, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. In summary, it was a strong quarter, and as I look ahead, I am very excited about the outlook for our company. With the breadth and balance of our portfolio, Cardinal Health is well positioned for the future. We have an excellent foundation on which to build. We are a valued partner to our customers across the healthcare continuum. And as our strategies have taken hold, we are poised to capitalize on the trends taking place in the global healthcare environment from the aging population to the continued shift of care to more efficient settings. As an organization, we are focused on continuing to innovate to improve the delivery and efficiency of healthcare. As always, our talented team of nearly 50,000 colleagues around the world are the core of our success and what truly differentiates Cardinal Health. It is an honor to represent them as CEO. I thank them for their hard work this past quarter and their continued commitment to our company. Let me now turn it over to Jorge. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. I'm delighted to begin this role and to join my first earnings call as CFO. Now, before I share about our performance, I'd like to give just a few thoughts. As I enter my second month in this role, I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I look forward to partnering with Mike, our leadership team, our Board and our investors to drive sustainable growth for Cardinal Health. Now, let me review in detail our strong financial performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide 7 of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter. As Mike said before, we are pleased with the second quarter results. Based on the performance year-to-date, we feel confident about Cardinal's outlook for the year. Starting with EPS, diluted EPS for Q2 was $1.51, a 13% increase versus the prior year. This includes a reduction of the federal tax rate, resulting from the recent U.S. tax reform. I will discuss this in detail in a few moments. Revenue increased 6% versus last year, totaling $35.2 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 16% to $1.9 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 24% versus last year in line with our expectations. This increase was driven primarily by our recent acquisitions, most notably the Patient Recovery business. Consolidated operating earnings were $730 million, which represent 4% growth versus the prior year. Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was about $81 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 26.2%, an 8 percentage point improvement versus the prior year, mainly driven by the recent tax reform. Second quarter diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 316 million, about 3.5 million fewer shares than the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Yesterday, as Mike mentioned, our Board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, and now we have about $1.3 billion available for share repurchase. Operating cash flow for the quarter came in at about $300 million, in line with our expectations. During the first six months of the fiscal year, we generated approximately $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. Our cash balance as of December 31 was $1.2 billion with about $500 million held outside the U.S. Now, let's move to segment performance. The Pharmaceutical segment delivered revenue growth of 5% in Q2. Revenues were $31.1 billion in the quarter. Sales growth was driven by both pharmaceutical and specialty distribution customers. This segment revenue increase was partially offset by the contract expiration of a large mail order customer, Prime Therapeutics in May of 2017. While exceeding our expectations, segment profit for the quarter decreased 4% to $514 million. This decrease was driven by costs related to the ongoing investment in our Pharmaceutical IT platform as well as the net performance of our generics program. We anticipated these headwinds and they were partially offset by strong performance in the Specialty business. Once again, the Specialty team delivered strong top and bottom-line growth in the quarter. The Pharma IT project continues to progress well and is on budget. Excluding this costs in the quarter, the Pharma segment profit would have been flat. As Mike said, generic market pricing and brand inflation performed in line with our expectations this quarter. Based on this, and what we saw in January, we continue to be confident in our full-year assumption. As a reminder, our generics program includes the impact from average selling price, volume changes, and the benefits of Red Oak Sourcing. Now, let's go to the results up in Medical segment. Revenue for the quarter grew 19% to just over $4 billion, primarily driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition and, to a lesser extent, new and existing customers. I'm happy to share that this is the first time this segment revenue exceeded $4 billion in a single quarter. Medical segment profit increased 38% to $220 million during Q2. This increase was driven by contributions from the Patient Recovery business, which was partially offset by the performance of Cardinal Health Branded products, including Cordis. Please note segment profit for the quarter includes a $22 million inventory fair value step-up expense related to the Patient Recovery business. Excluding this expense, Medical segment profit growth versus last year was 52%. I remain close to the integration of Patient Recovery. I am very happy to report that while still early, this business is performing on plan. Our teams are working very well to ensure a successful on-boarding. Also, I'd like to call out that Cardinal Health at-Home distribution services and naviHealth all performed very well and were all up double digits in earnings for the quarter. Now, I'd like to mention a few challenges we continue to address. As Mike mentioned, our exam gloves business has continued to see supply disruptions and commodity challenges similar to what we noted on our first quarter call. Our sourcing and commercial teams are pursuing several projects to minimize the impact from these dynamics. With respect to Cordis, let me provide some additional details around the ongoing performance and overall trajectory of this business. Overall, we are encouraged that in each of the last two quarters, Cordis revenue grew driven by our business outside the U.S. And we are excited to see the acceleration of our product partnership agreements. As you may recall, these partnerships have grown more slowly than expected. However, we are now seeing improved momentum in both product breadth and financial performance. Notably, as Mike said, we are excited that our partner, Medinol, received FDA approval to launch a new drug-eluting stent in the U.S. market through Cordis distribution. This is a key addition to our portfolio. While we continue to make progress on the commercial front, the overall earnings performance of Cordis was impacted by inefficiencies in the global supply chain and elevated SG&A outside the U.S. The team is fully focused on these issues and we have implemented robust remediation plans to address both inventory and SG&A challenges. We recognize it will take a little time to work through these items but we are moving expeditiously. The Cordis business remains a top priority for me and for the organization. We have great leaders in that business who have support from the entire enterprise to put this business on a capital-efficient growth trajectory. Transitioning back to our Q2 performance, on slide 7, you will see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. A $1.82 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS was primarily driven by the transitional tax benefit of $2.83 offset by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, impairments, and litigation. I now like to move to the topic of tax reform. I will quickly outline the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our second quarter and full fiscal year. While we have completed our initial analysis of the tax reform impact, keep in mind that these amounts are provisional and we may require adjustments in future periods. I think it is helpful to show you the performance for the quarter and the full year with and without the benefit of tax reform. If you look at slide 9, in the first column, we have provided a walk from our second quarter reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.51 to our non-GAAP EPS excluding the impact of tax reform of $1.31. The $0.20 reflects the benefit of the lower blended federal tax rate applied to our year-to-date U.S. pre-tax income. As a company with a June 30 fiscal year-end, we have a blended U.S. statutory sales tax rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018. Now, let's talk about the total year EPS assumptions in the second column. Our new non-GAAP EPS guidance range is $5.25 to $5.50. The walk to our original full year guidance includes a full-year benefit of $0.40 resulting from tax reform. This reflects the benefit of applying the lower blended sales tax rate of 28% to our full fiscal year forecasted U.S. pre-tax income. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance range excluding the impact of tax reform remains $4.85 to $5.10. As I noted earlier, there is a benefit of $2.83 resulting from tax reform, which is excluded from our non-GAAP figures. This is the estimated net benefit from both the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings in foreign subsidiaries. I think it is important to note that there are certain provisions of the new tax law that do not become effective for us until the beginning of our fiscal 2019. Provisions that could be a headwind for us include the elimination or repeal of certain U.S. deductions and the addition of new international provisions. Despite these headwinds, we expect our non-GAAP ETR for fiscal 2019 to be lower than fiscal 2018. Moving on to slide 10, you can see there are no changes to our fiscal 2018 revenue assumption and we have included the updated non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Now, turning to slide 11, for our full-year corporate assumptions, you will see that we have made three changes. First, given the recent tax reform, we are updating our non-GAAP ETR to a range of 29% to 31%. This is consistent with what I shared at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January. Second, we are revising our full-year share count projection down slightly to a range of 316 million to 317 million shares. And finally, we are updating our acquisition-related intangible amortization to $576 million or $1.16 per share. This is excluded from our non-GAAP EPS. Our Pharma segment assumptions are on the slide 12. We have one change to these assumptions. As you may have seen, we completed the sale of our distribution business in China on February 1 earlier than anticipated. As a result, we estimate a $0.05 per share negative impact to our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS. As Mike mentioned, we can absorb this in our current guidance. Also as a reminder, the China distribution business reported in both of our segments by contributing more to the Pharma segment. Our Medical segment assumptions for fiscal 2018 can be found on the slide 13 where we have one update to report. Given the challenges with Cordis and exam gloves that I discussed earlier, we expect the Medical segment profit, excluding Patient Recovery, to be flat to down for this year. One thing that I'd like to note is that on January 22, the medical device tax (sic) [medical device excise tax] (25:23) was suspended for two years in line with our fiscal 2018 expectations and existing guidance. From a capital allocation perspective, we are continuously looking at the most optimal deployment of capital. We will review cash benefits from tax reform and the proceeds from the China divestiture through the lens of optimizing sustainable and capital-efficient growth. We are committed to deploying capital in a balanced way through organic growth and differentiated dividend, value-creating M&A and share buybacks. In closing, we are pleased with our Q2 performance and excited about Cardinal's overall position. We're confident in our ability to execute throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll be taking our first question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Clayton Meyers on for Eric Percher. It's just \u2013 a good quarter on the Pharmaceutical segment. I just wanted \u2013 a few questions on that business. Particularly, it sounds to be (26:51) if I'm reading correctly that you performed better than expected on the buy-side via Red Oak. And then particularly I'm just wondering as you think about the generic market, if there is a difference in pricing between different generic categories, most notably, in oral solids and injectables, and maybe that's what we're seeing some noise from the manufacturers over the last couple of months. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Clayton, thanks a lot for the questions. Yeah. You're right, I think we had a very good quarter in the Pharmaceutical segment, it absolutely exceeded our expectations. And as we mentioned, a lot of it had to do with Red Oak in its performance on the cost side. As I mentioned, the generic deflation is trending basically about where we expected it to be. As far as your question on solid orals and injectables, yes, the majority of our generics that we sell and when we talk about our higher margin source program are our solid orals. Most of the injectable generics that we sell are through the GPO non-source programs, which are a lower-margin business for us. So that could be a little bit difference of why you might hear some different messages from pharma manufacturers. But we feel very good about where the Pharma segment is, particularly as I mentioned, Pharma distribution, but also Specialty and Nuclear continued to perform well for us. Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC : Great. Thanks. It's very helpful. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Clayton. Next question. Operator : The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. So I'm just trying to dig in a bit on the Medical side to just sort of understand some of the underlying. The color was helpful. But we've got a euro that's better that should help a number of the businesses and it looked like the inventory step-up was probably a little bit less then what you originally guided, and so those should've been I think a bit of a net benefit. And so as we're thinking about the headwind, Cordis, you called out but there, you've got a product launch and it seems like that's a pretty good product launch, and that's helpful. So where really is the magnitude of the delta I guess in the traditional business coming from? I'm just trying to tease out some of the parts. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Ross, for the question. A couple different pieces. The first thing I want to really emphasize, and then I'll let Jorge go through some of the details of the moving part, is the overall Medical segment is doing very well that when you take apart the business and take a look at how our post-acute businesses are doing, the at-Home and the naviHealth businesses, our services businesses, our product lines, they all are doing really well. So we feel good overall about the segment, but I'll have Jorge talk a little bit about the challenges and see if we can give you maybe just a little bit more color. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Ross. As we said before, in addition to Cordis, exam gloves is a headwind for us right now. It's been for a quarter or so now and the challenges will continue for a little while. One thing for you to remember also with respect to the core business is that the loss of VA that we had last year, we are still dealing with that headwind. Beyond that, as Mike said, the other businesses, and I indicated that on my prepared remarks, are doing really well. Your comment about FX, FX is not a headwind for us right now. As you said, it's probably a little bit of a net benefit. But remember that we have long exposures from a sales perspective but we also buy a lot of products and materials in foreign currency and so that offsets some of the benefit from FX. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : That's helpful. And maybe just a quick clarification on the tax rate. So in the deck, the ETR, you kind of quoted as 29% to 31%, and then in the press release we had 28%. I'm just trying to understand the difference between the delineation of those two definitions and then really understand kind of what the trajectory is into 2019 because I recall at JP, you talked about a number more in the mid-20s. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: That's a good question. The 28% that is the federal corporate tax rate. So that's a clean rate. The 29% to 30% is the effective tax rate, which includes not only the federal corporate tax rate but also all our taxes like state tax and things like that. So there is a little bit more to it on the effective tax rate. So that's the difference between those two. With respect to the second question about 2019, and I indicated that on my prepared remarks as well, we are experiencing a step-down this year is blended given the difference between the first half and the second half of the year, but we also expect a further step-down in 2019 as we experience the whole benefit for the full year of the 21% tax rate. Remember, there is also some provisions that kick in in 2019 that will offset some of the further step-down in 2019. But net-net, you should expect to see our ETR in 2019 to be lower than in 2018. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Ross. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Hill with RBC Capital Markets. Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. It's Stephen Hagan on for George. So just kind of a housekeeping item on the inventory step-up costs, with the lower impact this quarter, what's the expectation now for the full-year impact? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: So Stephen, this quarter, in Q2, was the last time that we had the step-up expense. So going forward, we won't have that effect anymore. Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then on the Pharma segment, what kind of drove the strength this quarter? Was there any pull-forward of future benefit, or was it really also the Specialty and the other things you pointed out? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: It was really just better-than-expected results on our generic programs in Pharmaceutical Distribution and then strength in both our Specialty businesses and our Nuclear businesses. Operator : And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks and good morning. It's Mike Minchak in for Lisa. I guess first question, in the past, you had talked about $0.16 of investments related to customer initiatives and spending related to opioids. Just wondering if you had any update in terms of that commentary and sort of how much of that ramped in the second quarter and what's the expectation for the full year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes. Sure. So a couple of pieces. As it relates to the opioids, we started to see some spending in Q2, but it was actually very minor. We took a little bit longer to get that ramped than we expected. We still expect to spend the full amount that we said we would. So you saw a little bit of a timing benefit in Q2 on not spending it, then you'll see more of a catch-up full spend in Q3 and Q4. And we actually are starting to see that spend already in January and February. So we feel good now that we're on track to see the spending go the way we expected it to now for the rest of the year. As far as the customer investments, I still feel like, as you can imagine, we did \u2013 they're still included in our outlook for the second half of the year. So we still are having ongoing conversations with the customers. And as I've mentioned before, I reiterate these are existing customers and these are some strategic initiatives that we're working through with them. And while I was hoping that we might have those finalized by now, I would still \u2013 I still feel like we will sometime this quarter. Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about utilization and volume trends in the Medical segment across both the acute ambulatory and home segments and sort of how we should think about the strong flu season is impacting the results and expectations for the year in both the Pharma and Medical segments? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. With respect to utilization, that is always a difficult, I guess, metric to track and because it depends on manufacturers. And so for us, the way we think about it is we look at our customer base and how they are doing. And what I can tell you is that our businesses are performing well in terms of sales. The majority of our customers are growing and as you see more consolidation in the medical space, there will always be some winners and some losers. And so utilization for us is a function of that. We see a good growth in our key accounts in the Medical front and that's reflected on our revenue growth performance so far. With respect to the flu season, in December, we saw some activity, and we believe in January, it's picking up a little bit. From a financial standpoint for us, in Q2, flu was not really a driver but we know that over the last few weeks, it's picking up. Operator : And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is Liza on actually for Ricky. Just clarification on the tax rate for this quarter. Can you maybe dive into \u2013 is this a lower federal tax rate assumed for the December quarter in the $0.20 and also why the $0.20 is outsized relative to the expectations for the next two quarters? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good question. The way it works is the ETR is a projection for the full year. So the projected ETR is in the 21% to 31% range. So if you pick the midpoint, the first half of the year is adjusted in a way that it's kind of a catch-up entry so that the average for all of the quarters' results in a 30% rate. The first quarter rate was kind of a typical rate of 36%. And so the entry in Q2 needs to average the two quarters such that the average for the entire year is a 30% range that we're talking about. So it's a mathematical adjustment to average the rate for the entire year. Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. I guess I know you've touched on kind of a lower tax rate going into fiscal 2019, but I guess how should we think about that relative to the 5.60% (38:09) that's been called out? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Remember the 5.60% (38:13) was an early outlook that we gave a while back and we have a lot of moving parts that we're going to be taking a look at. We still feel it's early to really talk about FY 2019. Clearly, tax rate will be one of the movers that we'll take a look at as we put together our guidance for next year. We're going to continue to take a look at our Patient Recovery business and how it's doing. So far, it's tracking as we expected it to be, but it's only been a few months, so we're going to want to get a little bit more time under our belt there. Obviously, the continued impact of the exam gloves, how Cordis is going to ramp up for us next year. And then, we'll take a look at generic programs and the net impact of customer wins and losses. Those are some of the things that we want to still play out for a few more months and another quarter or two. And then as we have in the past, in August, we'll come out with our guidance for 2019. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk a bit about margin expectations for the Medical division? I know that we had talked about with, I think, 5.75% margin long-term at one point. Any thoughts on that? Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Yeah. If you look at the margin rate for this quarter, which was about 5.4%, that rate includes actually the inventory step-up expense related to Patient Recovery. So if you adjust for that expense, that is not going to happen on the second half of the year. We are very close to the 6% margin rate expectation that we have for the second half of this year. So we feel good about being on a path to get into those margin rates for Medical that we discussed before. David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's great. And then just any thoughts on commentary from Washington around drug pricing reform, any thoughts on what the administration might do or not and how that could impact the business? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, and thanks a lot for the question, Dave. And just a couple of things about that. When I think about price reform and its impact on us, I'd kind of break it down into generics and branded drugs. And from a generic perspective, I think we can all agree that it tends to be the vast majority of those items are deflating and that they're roughly 90% of prescriptions in the U.S. are generics. And so from a cost effectiveness for the entire healthcare system, generics continue to be very, very cost effective for the system. So it's hard for me to imagine something in the area of generics that would be materially in the terms of the drug pricing area based on just the overall economics and the trends we're seeing in generics. As far as it goes to the branded side, as we've seen both in our guidance and others is that we're now only expecting to see somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% to 8% inflation from branded drugs. So the branded manufacturers themselves have cut back significantly on the amount of inflation or price increases that they've had. We continue to see that. And then as you're translating that into how it impacts us, as we mentioned in the past, we expect to be, and from everything we're seeing right now will be more than 90% of our branded margins are going to be non-contingent to inflation. So if you put that around, less than 10% of our branded margins are contingent to inflation, which again is down to 7% to 8%. So for us, as Cardinal, I think that this is an area that we feel good that we ought to be able to manage through very effectively however it goes in Washington. Operator : And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot have been asked but just maybe going back to, on Red Oak. Can you talk about sort of longer-term, when you think about the contribution here, obviously, we're talking about sort of a lower contribution year over year expected this year versus last. But as you kind of look at over the next couple of years, we do have some more launches coming. Can you think about \u2013 can you give us a sense on how maybe as we think about 2019, how that contribution could vary as we go forward? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. We're continuing to feel really good about Red Oak. It's not just about the fact that our scale and our ability to source, but that team is just \u2013 first of all, it's a great group of folks. They're very strategic. They're constantly thinking about new ways to approach and work with our manufacturing partners, thinking about the pipeline of launches. So I feel really confident in their ability to continue to give us year-over-year benefit. As I said, it might be a little bit less going forward year over year as we continue to work through the items. But anytime we see launches and stuff, I fully expect that Red Oak will put us in the best position possible to compete in the marketplace and have the best cost position. So continue to feel really good about all the work that they're doing and the benefits that will continue to drive going forward. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is it fair then as when we just look at the calendar of launches, is that a good proxy then just to think about sort of the incremental change in benefit from Red Oak? Or do you think we should think about Red Oak continuing to perform maybe better than what the market would look like? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question. There is so many things that go into it. So clearly, the launches are an important piece of it, but each launch is so different. Depending on whether it's a 2-player or a 5-player, whatever number market, the type of drug, how hard it is to make, the timing of the various launches, when other players come out on current drugs that might be 2 or 3-player markets, they get continued competition. So it's hard to really pick any one item and predict it. And so as we get closer to giving 2019 guidance, we'll give you some more color around the benefits that we expect from Red Oak. But whatever the environment is, I expect that we'll be in the best position to compete with just the team we have there. Next question. Operator : We will move on to Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the questions. Yeah, so just I know you've kind of answered this a couple of different ways. I just wanted to go back to make sure I understood the back half of the year. Big beat in the quarter even if I adjust out the benefit for tax from both the quarter and the guidance, and yet it looks like you're really not raising the back half at all. So I guess the question really is, are you anticipating some areas getting worse? Is there something you have visibility into the back half? I know you mentioned China but that's not all that significant in the grand scheme of what you did in the quarter and then you're not really raising the guidance outside of tax? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. I appreciate the question. So let me just give you a few thoughts on that. First, for me right now it just feels a little bit early to be raising guidance. I mentioned there are some small timing type of things that we'll be absorbing like the opioids that I mentioned that had less spend in Q2 and we'll have some more spend in Q3. As Jorge mentioned, we expected Cordis profits to ramp up in our original projections, and those are ramping up as quite as well as we would have liked them to. And then also the exam gloves has been somewhat of a challenge and we're still working through our various solutions there. And then as you just mentioned, we have the $0.05 from China. So you have all those, and then as a positive, as we've said, we feel really good about where the Pharma segment's at and that we do continue to expect it to be better than expected. But at this time, when we take all those puts and takes and put them together, we just feel the right thing to do is just to at this point in time maintain our guidance adjusted for the impact of tax reform. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And I guess just one quick follow-up on Medical. And I feel like you do get this question at least the last few quarters, but your largest peer there focused on the acute space continues to struggle quite a bit. And one of the main areas they talk a lot about is a very challenging end-market, yet that doesn't seem to be the case even if we kind of parse out Medtronic and Cordis around what the message is that you're sharing on that core business. So is there anything, any light you can shed on this for us as far as market share shifts, maybe just a different type of customer mix, because it really has become quite divergent between the message from your core Medical business and your largest peer? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question on that, too. I appreciate that. I don't want to comment on competitors' actual results. But I will say a few things. First of all, I think there has been some supply disruptions in the market for sure. But those items for us, from a profitability standpoint, have not been that significant of a driver in our Q2. And while we still see that there'll probably be some supply disruptions in three and four, we also don't expect that to be much of a negative driver for going forward for us. Now, we truly understand how difficult this is on our end-customers, and we know that it is making their lives tough and we are working incredibly hard every day to get after supply and make sure that we are on top of those things. But as far as the profit driver, it's not big. I think the big difference for us is that we made a decision years ago that we were going to change our value proposition. And that while distribution would always be part of our core and something important for us that we really needed to have a product strategy and that was going to differentiate us that we could take advantage of those rails going to those customers every single day and that we would be able to then drive our product mix and improve our overall profit. So I think the real difference here is our value proposition. And we've seen that play out in some of the recent wins over the last year or so. So I think it's really that is the difference in our value prop. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks. A quick follow-up on the customer initiatives you mentioned in the previous quarters as well as earlier on the call. I guess given we still don't have so much clarity there, would these expenses get pushed out into fiscal 2019? And can you just give us some greater color on what these initiatives entail? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. No. We don't expect them to get pushed into 2019. The amount that we had set aside and had given some early color on, we still would expect to happen in the second half of our fiscal 2018. And as far as more color, I can continue to really only say that it is with existing customers. It's something that we're working on with them that both sides would really be important long-term valuable opportunities for us. And other than those two things, I really can't speak more about it. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. And on Medical, can you speak to some of the broader drivers across the international markets? Where did you see sort of pockets of growth on a geographic basis? And I think you briefly mentioned this but what's truly embedded in your guidance as it relates to the foreign exchange impact? Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hi Erin, this is Jorge. I'm going to take that question. I would break down the international markets between Cordis and Patient Recovery. I think for Patient Recovery, what I would say is right now it's early to tell. We are on track with our deal model with respect to sales expectations in the international markets. With Cordis, it's a lot easier to see the performance in those markets. And I can tell you that the Cordis business is doing very well in Asia Pacific. We've seen tremendous growth in markets like China. We've seen a good turnaround of trends in other markets like Japan and we see some growth in places like Korea and Australia-New Zealand. For EMEA, we also see, in certain buckets, a fair amount of growth. The assumptions that we have with respect to FX in the forecast, we alluded to that before. FX is a little bit of a tailwind for us and that's what we have included in for the balance of the year, but it's not a significant driver. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC : Hey. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. Just a quick one on the generic deflation front. I know you've kept the mid-single digit assumption unchanged for the fiscal year. But, I guess, are you seeing anything materially different trend-wise on the buy-side and the sell-side as we've moved into 2018? And then kind of where do you envision that's going as we get into the back half of the fiscal year in comparison to the first half? Is it still in that mid-single digit range? Or was the first half slightly more deflationary? And then are there any material contracts, or RFPs, coming up on the sell-side for 2018? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Great. Remember, our calculation for generic deflation is a point-to-point calculation. So we basically look at the end of last year and to the end of this year, and we still expect, at that point, to see mid-single digits as our ultimate deflation number. And so we still feel good about that estimates and are trending there as far as \u2013 as we look at our continued trends. The piece, as I mentioned before, that's doing slightly better which is helping us is on the cost side. So deflation is tracking about where we expect, cost is tracking a little bit better, and that's driving some upside for us in Pharmaceutical Distribution. And as I mentioned, Specialty and Nuclear continue to perform better than we expected. As far as RFPs go, we don't actually really have any large account RFPs that we're renewing in our fiscal 2018 and those that are out there that are large, actually don't renew until the end of our fiscal 2019. Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. I tried to back out when all of my topics were covered. So thanks very much. I'm good here. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Eric. Operator : And we have time for one final question with John Kreger with William Blair. Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Courtney Owens on for John Kreger. Just a quick question. So can you provide us with just a little bit of an update on naviHealth? I heard you guys say that it performed pretty well during the quarter, but just would like an update kind of on what your expectations for that portion of the business going forward, and kind of what's been like the recent client uptake on that service. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. The business \u2013 we really are excited about the business itself. It's got a really good team. I think they're on trend. We're continuing to see both providers and payers looking for help in the post-acute space and we think we have a unique model that combines both software and analytics with clinicians to be able to really provide a top-notch service to those customers. So we continue to feel good about that business. We're making continued investments in that business, because we do see it as a business that we see growing going forward. But other than that I just, again, feel really good about it and feel good about the team. Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC: Awesome. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, I think that was the last call? Operator : Yes, it was. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mike Kaufmann for any closing remarks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Well, again, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I know you are having a busy day. We really appreciate the questions and we look forward to talking again soon. Have a good morning. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead, madam Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Lorena. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties. Today's press release and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit your questions to one so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional question. Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter performance and discuss some strategic actions we have underway as we plan for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Then Jorge will provide some additional financial detail and color. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Let me start by saying we recognize that today's results did not meet your expectations or ours. The biggest variable driving these results was some unanticipated disappointing performance from our Cordis business which masked an otherwise better than expected quarter. The Cordis performance not only reduced our non-GAAP operating earnings but more significantly, it created a higher non-GAAP effective tax rate. But for the Cordis tax issues alone, non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.52. We will walk you through the details. As you'll see, on an operating earnings basis, overall results came in largely as expected. In fact, the majority of the business, with Cordis being the notable exception, performed in line with or above plan highlighted by better than expected results in the Pharma segment. Let me start with some overall results, then move to segment details. Then I'll give you a broader perspective on our priorities and our plans to optimize our performance going forward and positively impact the trajectory of our business. Revenue for the third quarter reached $33.6 billion, up 6% from last year, and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 3%. Non-GAAP EPS decreased by 9% to $1.39 for the quarter versus last year's $1.53. While Jorge will go into more details, a higher than expected non-GAAP effective tax rate resulted in a $0.19 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS. $0.13 of this was related to the current and forecasted results of Cordis. Operating cash flow was strong. It exceeded $750 million for the quarter. In addition, we received approximately $850 million in net proceeds from the February 1 divestiture of our China distribution business. In the Pharma segment, revenue for the quarter increased nearly 5% to $29.7 billion, driven primarily by growth in business with existing customers offset in part by the previously announced loss of our contract with Prime Therapeutics. Segment profit for the quarter was down, but less than anticipated. So we were pleased with this performance. Contributing to the results, we saw strong performance from Red Oak. However, it was not enough to offset generic deflation. A strong flu season contributed some upside and brand inflation has tracked generally in line with our expectations. Of note this quarter was the renewal of our contract with Optum. We are very pleased that we extended and expanded this important relationship and our contract now extends through the end of our fiscal year 2024. Optum has been a customer of ours since August 2015 when we signed our first multi-year agreement. We look forward to deepening our relationship with them and pursuing new ways to partner and collaborate. Beyond Optum, we are excited to have signed some additional new business and completed key renewals with a number of smaller existing customers. Before I turn to specialty, I want to mention the efforts by the entire industry to combat the abuse of prescription opioid pain medications. As you know, we launched our Opioid Action Program last fall. In this quarter, we began distributing Narcan free of charge to more than 40 organizations who are providing the product to first responders and law enforcement. Just last weekend, more than 150 Cardinal Health employees volunteered with our friends at Kroger to staff 105 take-back events in 26 states. And we are continuing to provide grants and support for education and advocacy to prevent misuse and abuse. All of us at Cardinal Health are committed to being at the table. We are continuing to focus significant time and effort to help alleviate this public health crisis that has touched many of us and our communities. On the specialty side, this business continues to exceed our expectations. It delivered double-digit top and bottom line gains, reflecting growth with both new and existing customers. Nuclear, while not a large contributor, also performed well. So overall, Pharma performance was better than expected. Turning now to the Medical segment. For the quarter, the Medical segment posted revenue growth of 15% while segment profit increased 34% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition, partially offset by the continued challenges at Cordis. We are very pleased that the Patient Recovery business continues on track and we are making good progress on the integration. We are executing on our plan in hitting important milestones as we prepare to transition this business off of the TSAs. Our team is laser focused and we understand the importance of getting this right. There's a lot of hard work being put in by our integration team and we appreciate their diligence. At Cordis, while we are making progress, there is still much work to be done for this business to meet our expectations. We are pleased that year-to-date performance has shown growth on the top line, and we are seeing progress in international markets including China, where sales are up double digits. In addition, our introduction of a drug-eluting stent to the offering is going well and the pipeline looks promising. However, as we've noted in previous quarters, operating cost and inventory reserves continue to be challenges. Both came in even higher than expected this quarter and continue to weigh on profitability. We are moving aggressively to stabilize this business. Jon Giacomin has taken on this challenge in his new capacity as the Medical segment CEO and he and Pat Holt, Cordis' new leader, have spent the last few months digging into the business. Together with the Cordis team, they are executing on a series of initiatives to improve performance and drive profitability. However, this will take time. We must not lose sales momentum and we need several tools in place to enable significant progress. For example, the recent launch of our new global supply chain platform will be critical in providing the team with better inventory visibility. It will also provide better insights into demand so we can more effectively and profitably manage this business. In addition to the launch of our supply chain platform, work is underway to help us do four things. First, we are implementing new process and technology improvements that will better manage our Cordis consigned inventory. Next, we will refocus the product portfolio to enhance efficiency and profitability. Additionally, we continue to look at ways to reduce the cost structure. And finally, we will enhance our capabilities around demand planning to better ensure we have the right inventory in the right markets to capitalize on sales opportunities and reduce inventory reserves. We expect that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of FY 2019 and remain confident that the business can be a significant contributor over the longer term. On a positive note, while the year-over-year contribution to segment profit growth was relatively smaller, we continue to see strong demand and execution at our at-Home, NaviHealth and medical services businesses. So overall, while we continue to work through a couple of challenges, the Medical segment had success in many areas and we are confident in its potential to continue to deliver a differentiated value proposition to customers and contribute as a long-term driver of high margin growth. Turning now to our outlook. As you've seen from our press release, we are forecasting a more modest fourth quarter and Jorge will walk you through the specifics of how we are thinking about the quarter and full year. As we look ahead, we are now anticipating FY 2019 will be more challenging than previously expected. While we will still have the tailwinds of Patient Recovery in Red Oak and subsequent U.S. tax reform, we now see significant headwinds including Cordis performance, customer repricing, the loss of PharMerica and continued generic deflation. Taking into account both the headwinds and the tailwinds, the company should see some modest growth in non-GAAP EPS in FY 2019 based on the updated FY 2018 guidance of $4.85 to $4.95. On our August earnings call we will provide specific FY 2019 guidance and more detail as we usually do at year end. Within this context, as we think about the future, FY 2019, but also longer term, our team is taking a hard and fresh look across the business to determine what the right steps are to drive long term growth for the benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders. Over the past four months since Jorge and I took on our new roles, our management team has been carefully assessing both where we are and the potential opportunities that we have the best position Cardinal Health in what we know is a rapidly evolving industry landscape. We know we have terrific opportunities to continue to capitalize on the strengths of our model, the complexity of the supply chain and the stickiness of our customer relationships. While we are in the early stages of our work, what I can say is that we are taking a comprehensive and objective look across the business with a view towards better leveraging our unique and broad portfolio of assets to drive profitable future growth. Among our priorities, we are focused on three key things. Number one, our business mix. We know that we need to have the right composition and balance in our portfolio to fully capitalize on industry tailwinds and opportunities for growth. In addition, we are actively looking at select portions of our business that are poised for outsized growth and focused on scaling our performance in them. We are carefully considering the right investments to achieve both of these objectives. Number two, our cost structure. Execution is essential to sustainable performance. We are taking a fundamental and in-depth look at the best opportunities to drive efficiency and lower our manufacturing and SG&A cost to improve our ability to compete. Finally, number three, our capital deployment strategy. We're examining how to best utilize our strong financial profile and capital to drive value for our shareholders and other constituents. We are carefully considering how we balance our various short and long term needs. The entire team is highly energized to advance and implement the right strategy for the future of Cardinal Health. We have an exceptional portfolio of assets, a tremendously talented and dedicated organization and a critical position in the delivery of Global Healthcare. We look forward to building on this incredibly strong foundation to drive future performance and increase value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our plans as we update them and develop them further. With that, let me turn it over to Jorge to discuss more detail on the financials. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, we are focused on execution and we are actively working through our near term challenges to deliver the results that we all expect. We will achieve these objectives by enhancing efficiencies, reducing complexity and cost in a systematic way and ultimately generating sustained growth and delivering value. Today I will cover three key topics. First, I will review our results for the quarter and give some additional detail by segment. Second, I'll share some thoughts on our outlook for the total year. Finally, I will provide some thoughts on our next steps to build a path toward growth. The financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide seven of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the third quarter. Operating earnings was in line with our expectations this quarter but fell short at the EPS line driven by a substantially higher tax rate. Beginning with the total company results, diluted EPS for Q3 was $1.39, a 9% decrease versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a substantially higher tax rate which I will explain shortly. Revenue increased 6% versus last year, totaling $33.6 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 11% to $1.9 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 18% versus last year in line with our expectations. This increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions including Patient Recovery. Consolidated operating earnings was $781 million, which represents 3% growth versus the prior year. Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was about $81 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 37.5%, a 5 percentage point increase versus the prior year and about 7 percentage points more than what we expected for the quarter. Two primary factors account for this unfavorable variance. First, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we had several favorable discrete tax items which drove last year's Q3 effective tax rate to an unusually low 32%. Second, in Q3 this year, Cordis performance drove an unexpected reduction to pre-tax income in certain geographies. These require a year-to-date true up of approximately $0.13 per share relative to our Q2 expectations. Additionally, we book provision to return adjustments of $0.06 that contributed to a higher than anticipated increase in the Q3 effective tax rate. These unfavorable tax adjustments reduced the benefits from U.S. tax reform this year and we now expect our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate to be between 32% and 34%. Third quarter diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 315 million, about 2.7 million fewer shares than the third quarter of fiscal 2017. During the quarter, we completed share repurchases for a total of $300 million bringing our total fiscal year to date repurchases to $450 million. We have about $1 billion remaining under our board approved share repurchase plan. Operating cash flow was very strong for the quarter. It came in ahead of our expectations at $754 million. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated approximately $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. Our cash balance as of March 31 was $2.2 billion with about $600 million held outside the U.S. I'll now transition to segment performance which you can find starting on slide five. The Pharmaceutical segment delivered strong revenue growth of nearly 5% in Q3. Revenues were $29.7 billion in the quarter. Sales growth was driven by both Pharmaceutical and Specialty distribution customers and was partially offset by the previously announced expiration of the Prime Therapeutics contract and the divestiture of the China distribution business. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 2.5% to $596 million. This reflects a modest negative impact from our generics program performance, even taking into account the strong flu season. This favorability from the flu season will not continue into Q4. Segment profit for Q3 also reflects a positive contribution from the Specialty Solutions business. As a reminder, the early completion of the China distribution business divestiture on February 1 is reflected in Q3 results and will more significantly impact Q4. Now, I'll turn to the results of the Medical segment on slide six. Revenue for the segment grew 15% in the quarter to $3.9 billion, primarily driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition. Medical segment profit increased 34% to $199 million during Q3. This increase was driven by contributions from Patient Recovery and was offset by lower than anticipated performance primarily in Cordis, and to a lesser extent, other Cardinal Health branded products. Patient Recovery continues to perform in line with our expectations. As Mike said, our teams are making good progress in preparation for the TSA exits that begin this summer. Other areas of the Medical segment performed well in the quarter. We saw nice growth in Cardinal Health at-Home, lab and services. Also our strategic accounts were up for the quarter. As we discussed in our last call, we continue to face challenges in the Medical segment mostly with Cordis. We are working through the headwinds in the Cordis business. We've seen revenue growth year to date primarily driven by our business outside the U.S., particularly in China where we saw double digit revenue growth. On the operations front, we're actively working to position Cordis on a path toward growth. We have implemented several supply chain work streams to enhance our global demand planning capabilities and consignment process. As part of this initiative, we implemented new ERP functionality which allowed us in Q3 to identify inventory positions in certain geographies that require higher inventory reserves. This new functionality gives us greater market visibility and will help us continue to reduce complexity in our global supply chain. The weaker than expected Cordis performance and higher inventory reserves are major contributors to the higher than anticipated tax rate for the current quarter and full year. Though we are actively deploying operational improvement efforts, it will take time to yield the results we expect. Now I will transition to GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter which you can find on slide seven. A $0.58 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition related costs. Next I'd like to discuss our guidance for this year found on slide nine. Based on Q3 results and expectations for the fourth quarter, we have revised our full year guidance to a range of $4.85 to $4.95 from our previous range of $5.25 to $5.50. This revision is primarily driven by Cordis operating performance and its corresponding impact to the tax rate that I mentioned earlier. For our full year corporate assumptions found on Slide 10, you will see that we have several changes. First, based on my earlier commentary on the tax rate, we now expect the full year tax rate to be between 32% and 34%. We are reviewing options to address the Cordis related tax rate increase that we're seeing in the second half and mitigated negative impact in the future. We have revised our diluted shares outstanding to a range of 315 million to 316 million shares. We expect our interest and other expense to be between $330 million and $350 million. We also expect our capital expenditures to be between $400 million and $430 million. Lastly, we're updating our acquisition related intangible amortization to $575 million. Our Pharma segment assumptions are on Slide 11 where we have three changes. We now expect our full year segment profit to be down to a range of high single to low double-digits. This is an improvement from our previous assumption of down low double-digits. Also, we now expect to see mid to high single-digit deflation in generic drug prices and better than expected incremental contribution from Red Oak Sourcing. While generic deflation is slightly higher than our original expectations, we've seen moderation in deflation versus last year and sequentially. Keep in mind, our generic deflation assumption is a point-to-point calculate from June-to-June. Our Medical segment assumptions are on Slide 12 where we have two updates. First, we now expect Medical segment profit to be down high teens for the year excluding Patient Recovery. This reduction reflected business dynamics that I discussed earlier, specifically related to the challenges we continue to address in the Cordis business and to a lesser extent in our Cardinal Health Branded products including exam gloves. Second, we will not achieve the 6% margin rate in the second half of fiscal 2018, again primarily due to Cordis' performance. Now, let me share a few additional thoughts that I think can be useful to help you understand the remainder of the year. As you know, we had about $0.08 in our second half for customer initiatives. As Mike mentioned, we extended and expanded our relationship with Optum which represents about half of our planned customer initiatives for fiscal 2018. In addition, we discussed on our Q2 call that the China distribution business divestiture will be a loss of $0.05 for the full year, mostly in Pharma. Also, we anticipate that the operational challenges with Cordis will continue through Q4 and fiscal 2019. In closing, we're focused on creating a path toward growth in fiscal 2019 and we are committed to developing and implementing a strategy that will position Cardinal Health for long term success. To that end, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are proceeding with a detailed operational review which will include growth and efficiency initiatives as well as portfolio optimization and capital allocation. We'll share more about this in August. With that I'd like to open the line and invite your questions. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ross Muken in Evercore. Please go ahead. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Hi, good morning, guys. Obviously a lot on the update. Can you just help us in terms of interpreting kind of what we should learn from 4Q and that 4Q guide about 2019? I know you probably don't want to go into too much detail on 2019. But Mike, you sort of laid out some of the headwinds or incremental headwinds the business is facing. But obviously some of those are occurring in the quarter and then some things may not continue in the future. And obviously a huge swing factor is the tax rate. So can you just help us understand sort of in that 4Q run rate as we lift off relative to what you've talked about, at least qualitatively, what's already captured, what's not captured, what are the other things we should be considering? And then anything you can give us on the tax rate would be helpful. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hey, thanks for the question, Ross. A lot of pieces there. And as you said at the beginning, we're going to really be limited here because we really want to take some time and continue our analysis and update folks at the time of our year end guidance, and at that time. So right now all I can say is you kind of talked about it. As you can imagine, we see some tailwinds from things like tax reform and Red Oak. But some of the other items that you mentioned around repricings and other pieces are going to be some headwinds for us. So right now, what we can provide you is, and we just, again, want to try to be helpful at this time is that we would expect to see modest growth off of the $4.85 to $4.95 guidance that we gave you. And we plan to come back with a lot more detail and thoughts around that in August. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And maybe just, Mike, just I realize just maybe on the tax rate, because that is so sensitive, can you help us understand a bit better what are the key drivers we have to look for that's causing that to be above what one would expect an effective rate to be in the new tax reform environment, and then what the path is back to a more normalized rate longer term? Because I'm assuming a north of 30% rate is probably not where the business ends up on a very long term basis. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Ross this is Jorge. I'll take that question. With respect to the issue that we're facing, in simple terms, the downturn in the Cordis performance results created certain losses in certain jurisdictions where we cannot out take the benefit of those operating losses from a tax perspective. Obviously we are reviewing multiple options available to address the \u2013 to your question, the going forward impact and we expect to be in a position to take action within the next few months. I think overall the impact from U.S. tax reform will continue to benefit us and we expect to see a decline in our tax rate going forward. The exact impact from the dynamic that we have going on right now is something that we will be \u2013 we are evaluating and we are finding options to address that long term. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: And if you remember last time on the call, we also mentioned that with U.S. tax reform, the positives of it, because we're a June 30 year-end, we had the six months' worth of that. But as we mentioned before, we wouldn't be able to see those benefits double in our FY 2019 because some of the other components of the Tax Reform Act that have a negative impact on us don't actually kick in until our FY 2019. And that, we said we would still be evaluating those and we're still at that point because there's still some clarity being given on those items and so we're still working through those. Again, we said that U.S. tax reform would still be a net positive for us in 2019. But because some of those negative items don't kick in until July 1, we're still evaluating those too. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question? Operator : Next question is from Glen Santangelo in Deutsche Bank. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Mike, I just want to follow up on some of the comments that you made with respect to the new management is sort of working with the board to take a comprehensive look across the businesses. And I know you probably don't want to go into too much detail there, but I'm trying to get a better sense, are you assessing whether you think maybe you need to add more pieces to try to make what you have work a little bit better? Or are you trying to more single that maybe you need to do a full blown evaluation of everything that you do have and maybe start considering shedding some pieces? So any additional elaboration there would be helpful. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Actually, don't see it as either one of those. First of all, I think the change in management, for us, we really feel lucky that we were able to take Jon Giacomin who has a tremendous track record as our leader on our Pharmaceutical segment and someone I've worked with a long time, and actually has a lot of knowledge of the Medical business based on some of his prior history within Cardinal, or outside of Cardinal and within Cardinal. So John has been moved over to be CEO of the segment and he'll bring a very disciplined and focused approach to what all we're doing there. And then we changed out the leader of the Cordis business with someone who was actually running our Asia-Pac business within Cordis, which was doing incredibly well. He's a very seasoned leader, knowledgeable of the business, has a good track record with the business, and is a guy that we have a lot of faith in. So as far as leadership changes, we've made those two initially and we'll continue to add some talent in the Medical segment in some areas that we think could be beneficial. We actually feel really good about our portfolio in Medical. What we're disappointed on is really just our execution in a few areas, again particularly and primarily related to Cordis. So I don't really see an absolute need to add pieces. I think in the future we still completely believe in the strategy of having a product business on top of a distribution business. And after we get a chance to absorb the Patient Recovery acquisition and get the Cordis business back on a growth trajectory, we'll continue to look at more pieces. But I don't think we need to have those. And at this point in time, we're always going to be evaluating our entire portfolio but there's nothing sticking out to me that there's something that we need to shed in order to be able to operate effectively going forward. Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe just one quick follow up on generic pricing. I mean, it felt like through the winter months maybe we were starting to see some of that generic price deflation abate somewhat. Now you're kind of signaling maybe it's getting a little bit worse. And so could you maybe just give us a sense for maybe what we saw through the winter months and what we're seeing now? And do you expect that this is going to translate into any additional sell side pricing pressure? And I guess I'm kind of curious also, why do you guys disclose so much about generic pricing? Aren't you just signaling to your customers that they should be asking for greater discounts? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I think \u2013 look we always have to balance what we try to disclose to be helpful to you guys as while as what's a competitive situation. But what we're really saying is we're not at all saying that we think it's deteriorating. In fact, what we're seeing is that it is moderating from last year and sequentially from the last quarter. So all we're saying is that originally when we looked at our point to point number, we expected to finish in the mid-single digits down from point to point. And as we look at it, we think it might be slightly worse than that from that point-to-point, but still better sequentially and versus the prior year. And so we continue to see it moderate. So we aren't seeing \u2013 and I wouldn't characterize it as seeing it more aggressive, necessarily, pricing in the market. We just didn't \u2013 it's just not moderating as much as we originally thought it might. Next question, please. Operator : Next question from Michael Cherny in Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, team, and thanks for all the color so far. I just wanted to follow up on the customer repricing commentary you had relative to 2019. You mentioned the Optum expansion, some of the customer initiatives. As you think about heading into 2019 and the moving pieces of your business, is Optum the only pressure you see relative to customer repricing, or how you think about the rest of the business in terms of what could pressure into 2019? Broadly speaking, I don't know if you can give an exact number, but just maybe give some qualitative comments about how you see that shaking out over the next year. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, we can't go into any customer details, but I'll try to be helpful here. Optum is clearly one of them and Optum is one of our largest customers and we're excited to renew and expand our relationship with them. We also have repriced some of our other customers during this year. And so as you can imagine from our budget process, roll in the impact year-over-year for that. And as we looked out at our contract expirations over the next 12 to 18 months, we also take a look at those to understand the timing of when some of those customers may reprice and build all of that in. So that's what we take into account to do that and we do expect that to be something that we have a larger maybe portion than normal to do next year and that's why those customer repricings are significant for us. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. I'll jump back into the queue. Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Next question. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : Next question from Robert Jones in Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, thanks for the questions. Mike, just wanted to get a little bit of a better understanding of the size and scope of the Cordis issue. Obviously there's been several revisions along the way around the business. You guys have given a lot of commentary this morning on it. But if I just look at the performance in Medical in the quarter, I'm curious if Cordis is actually profitable today as we look at 3Q. And then you talked about getting back to profitable growth by the end of fiscal 2019. I'm just wondering if you could share some more specificity around what steps you need to take in order to get the business back to profitable growth by the end of next fiscal year. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Couple things. First of all, I would say inventory reserves are one of the biggest issues we're having. As we came off the TSAs and have been working through this, our ability to be able to understand all of the demand signals, roll those demand signals up, turn those into manufacturing plans and then correspondingly having visibility to both the consigned inventory as well as our own inventory across our network on Cordis, particularly outside the U.S. It's obviously much easier for us in the U.S. but outside the U.S. has been much more difficult than we expected it to be. As we said in prior quarters, we said we would be rolling out some IT projects and solutions. We rolled one of those out in this past quarter which started giving us more visibility to our inventory and as you might expect, as we rolled that out, that visibility pointed out to us that we had some inventory that needed to be reserved against due to excess amounts in certain parts of the world. So that drove some inventory write-offs that we had and we're going to be rolling out some further detail IT systems to give us more clarity. And so we believe that we're going to be working through some challenges and getting our inventory at the right levels in the right spots in order to \u2013 and that's probably going to create \u2013 has and probably will create some inventory reserve challenges. Second of all, when you don't have as good of demand signals, it's hard to run your manufacturing plants as efficiently as you would like to and so that's been a challenge for us on our cost side. And so as we get better visibility into that, we'll be able to do the types of things we need to do in our manufacturing plant to reduce cost. And lastly, setting up the ex-U.S or O-U.S. cost structure related to the commercial organization and the other pieces has been more costly than we anticipated. And we so far have been erring to doing everything we need to do to support our sales team so we don't have any impact on our top line. And that has caused us to have more expenses than we expected to, again, particularly outside the U.S. where 70% of Cordis' business are. So that's the big things that are causing it. And as you can imagine, we have work plans on each one of those to get after those in order to get us back on track for profitable growth at the end of 2019. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: No, I appreciate all that Mike. And just one quick follow up on your repricing comments as a headwind to 2019. I'm just wondering, is that normal course of business as you re-up important customers like Optum, or is that something incremental to what you've been seeing in the market? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, I would say it's more normal course of business. We operate in a very competitive environment. And while we have great relationships with our customers, they're always looking for us to be able to provide some additional value to them. But this is nothing where we're seeing necessarily different pricing in the market or competitive nature than we have in the past. We just have a large share of repricings ahead of us in 2019 that we're going to need to work through. Next question, please. Operator : Next question from Charles Rhyee in Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company : Yeah, hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, sorry to stay on the Medical topic here, but last quarter you guys actually posted a really good result in Medical. And if we backed out the inventory step-up charge, it would've been even better. Can you give us sort of a contrast and compare like what changed really in the last three months that \u2013 because it seemed like last quarter, things were actually going in the right direction. Maybe you can give us a sense on what reversed so much from last quarter to this one? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. It's really Cordis, is by far the biggest component of it. It is \u2013 again we rolled out that inventory system during, late in our quarter. And as we rolled up and took a look at our inventory really for the first time to be able to see it a lot more clearly across the globe, it created a large inventory write-off in the quarter that was a significant hit to our operating earnings in Medical. Exam gloves also continues to be a challenge in the quarter, but that was the biggest one with the Cordis write-off. Then, as part of your work what you have to do is you then have to re-look at your forecast for Cordis. And what happens is when you take a look at our inventory write-offs we've had, the performance of the business, as I mentioned, the various components, and you forecast where you're going to be for the year. As Jorge gave some color on, it changed where we believe our income was going to be in various jurisdictions and that caused us to have to go back and restate what we expect the tax impact would be on Cordis. I know that's below the line, but that was what drove the tax component that also had the impact on EPS that we mentioned. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company : I see. So just to be clear, what you're saying is that if you had this inventory system in place a quarter earlier, we might have seen some of these effects earlier than now? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Oh, absolutely. Had we had it in place, we probably would've seen some write-offs at that time. But it's again hard to know. You do the best you can with the visibility you had. It rolled off. Well, when the system rolled on, we got better visibility. We were able to assess in a better way what our inventory situation needed to be from the reserves. Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company : Okay, great. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Next question please. Operator : Comes from Ricky Goldwasser in Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, hi, good morning. So I have a couple of questions on the drug distribution side. So you talk about better results in distribution and I know that you highlighted specialty in Red Oak. But it seems that there's some conflicting remarks. So if we think about Red Oak, you talked about the fact that it was a headwind to operating income in the quarter. And then you also said that performance from Red Oak then is not enough to offset deflation. So can you give a little bit kind of like context? Is it that just price deflation from manufacturers is picking up and you are not able to garner the same pricing power over them through the purchasing consortium? And then secondly, what does that mean to sell-side pricing? Does this mean that we're seeing more price concessions that you need to give to your independent customers? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Ricky. I'm not how \u2013 as far as the comment around Red Oak being a headwind. Red Oak was absolutely not a headwind at all. Red Oak has been and continues to be a tailwind for us and we feel actually absolutely great about Red Oak. We think they continue to perform better than anyone in the market. We like our model. We like where we're going. We like our talent. No issues at all with Red Oak; continues to be a tailwind. What I was trying to indicate was that the generic deflation within the quarter was more than the over performance of Red Oak and so just to tie that piece out. And so in total, what we're saying that we're not seeing anything really different in the marketplace from pricing pressures from our customers or from competitors. So we don't see the environment being different than we had been expecting it to be other than we just looked at where we actually thought we would finish at June 30. And when we were looking at that, we thought that we might not be \u2013 we said we'd be down mid single digits. And we think we might be somewhere between mid-single and high-single digits. But again, still better sequentially and better than last year on where generic deflation is. So my summary would be Red Oak's still a tailwind. Generic deflation is moderating. It's just that Red Oak is not enough itself in order to offset what we saw toward generic deflation in the quarter. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And if we step back and we think about what do you think the sustainable growth rate is for the drug distribution business? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. At this point in time we'll take a look at that and give some more color when we come out with our 2018 guidance. We still have a lot of work that would \u2013 or, I'm sorry, our 2019 guidance. We still have a lot of work to do to understand all the various components of both the Pharma and Medical segment and we'll do that and give more color in August. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question? Operator : It comes from Lisa Gill in JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Mike, just I want to come back to Cordis just one last time strategically. So when we think about Cordis and the asset that it is, can you help me to understand why it's important to the portfolio? When we think about cross sell, I know there's a lot of sales outside the U.S. Is this your anchor to build out your medical supply business outside the U.S.? I just really want to understand \u2013 I understand the commitment that you're making to try to rebuild this business and everything that it's going to take on your side, but I just wanted to understand the strategic rationale for doing so. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No, thanks. Good question and I appreciate it, Lisa. I think you hit it pretty well there in the fact that when we first bought Cordis, again, we think that it fits within our ability to bundle and work with our customers to bring a total package of products that our value proposition could help them have equal or better products at lower cost. So we think it fits well within our overall product offering to customers in the U.S. And then externally, it really helped us get a base of being able to grow and sell our products outside the United States. By being 70% of its volume outside the U. S., what that did is caused us to be able to and begin to build an ex-U.S. infrastructure. Granted, that building of that infrastructure has been more expensive than we thought. It hasn't gone as well as we thought. So we're clearly disappointed and absolutely will own up to that. But we learned a lot from doing that and we were able to set up third party logistics companies, set up a HR processes and all those things. And we've been using that in order to put on top of that the Patient Recovery business that is outside the United States. And so we're able to leverage off of that as well as some other moves that we've made to take back some of our other products outside the U.S. that we were going through others to be able to sell that so we can offer a lot more robust product offering outside of the United States. So I think that's a good piece of our strategy and why we still feel that's a good fit for us. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so as you evaluate that, I mean, so it's been a couple of years since you bought Cordis, about almost a year for Patient Recovery. What's your timeline where you say, yes, this is \u2013 obviously, I mean, if we see the numbers turn around then it's a yes, it's working. But do you also have a timeline of you know what? Maybe this isn't the strategy that makes sense for us. Maybe we should stay more so in the U.S. and think about maybe divesting things rather than investing in them. I think that's the big question for a lot of us is just to understand your process how you're thinking about this and what the timeline is for those types of evaluations. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question. It's hard to put a specific timeline on that. It's something that we are clearly doing. I think there's various degrees too. There's also being outside the U.S. in 60 countries or are you outside the U. S. in 30 or 40 countries? So I don't think it's necessarily all in of whether you want to be outside of the U.S. or not. It would be hard for me to imagine at this point in time not wanting to be outside the U.S. with our significant breadth of products, many of which in our Patient Recovery business as well as Cordis we think can compete effectively outside the United States. But whether or not we need to have the breadth of 60 or 70 countries or not, that's something we're absolutely looking at at this point in time right now and whether each and every country is where we need to be. So we're going to continue to evaluate that portfolio, but feel that we have some really great products that we think can help people outside the United States as well as in the United States. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Next question, Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : From Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks. I guess beyond Cordis, can you give us an update on the Medtronic integration process here? And can you speak maybe to some of the other businesses as well within the segment and naviHealth for instance and the prospects there? And then I'm curious how core is the exam gloves business to your Cordis business overall? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Great. So couple things there. Just the last piece, the exam gloves business would not be tied at all to the Cordis piece. That is just a large volume commodity type of a product that I think every distributor has to have access to and have a private label offering on in order to have a low cost alternative for it. So I think that's just one of the staple products that everybody needs to have to be a product company and distribution company. And it's just that with the limits on availability for the product and some commodity challenges, it's creating some headwind right now, as I've mentioned in the past, because we have a lot of downstream fixed contracts that we're working through. As far as Patient Recovery, the Medtronic acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, that continues to go well. We continue to hit our milestones. One of the things that we've done and that Jon was able to do with his leadership is he was able to tap back into the Pharma side and bring over some excellent talent from the Pharma side to help join the team on Medical. And so Jon's done a nice job of taking a look at where we could use some various folks, bring some people over that are experts in areas like inventory management, data management and things like that to help the team. And of course we operate as one Cardinal Health. And so the Pharma team's happy to contribute whatever resources we can in order to get it right. So, so far, that acquisition is going well. We begin to roll off of some of the TSAs in our mid to late summer and that'll be a kind of a new big checkpoint for us to make sure that goes well. But so far, we still are feeling like we're on track and hitting the milestones that we have. As far as the other businesses that you mentioned, we're seeing really strong demand for naviHealth and our at-Home business in particularly are two that we feel really good about. We continue to see that trend of care moving more towards the home. Both of those businesses compete in that space and both are, we believe, best-in-class in that space. And so we're seeing a lot of demand not only for just core everyday services that they offer, but for folks to want to partner with them in various unique ways in order to drive volume. So we feel really good about both of those businesses as well as our portfolio of medical services businesses, freight management and others that we have that we're also seeing very nice performance from. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then could I just ask a quick one on CapEx, because it stepped down for the year. I guess should we expect a meaningful step up in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: At this point in time, that's something that, as Jorge and I look at all of our spends of capital, that CapEx, we're always going to want to make sure that we're investing appropriately in the business, but at the same time being very careful because we know what that creates in the future. And so this was more of just us over the last 60 days or so evaluating what was out there and also reprioritizing some of our focus and bandwidth on other projects that just then we did need to spend some of the capital that we had previously anticipated to spend. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Next question. Operator : Next question is from David Larsen in Leerink. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk a bit about the inventory management system that the Medtronic Patient Recovery business is on? Like what is your level of visibility into those products? And are we at risk of seeing a similar situation with that business line from what we're seeing with Cordis now? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. First of all, couple things. The Patient Recovery business remember is more 75% in the U.S., much smaller volumes outside the U. S. So that's first thing to know and it's actually just coming into our warehouses and part of our everyday offering. And so from an inventory visibility standpoint, very little concern on Patient Recovery. Second thing related to Patient Recovery and our other medical products, they're not consigned inventory type of items. And so that creates a different level of inventory visibility challenges that we don't have in Patient Recovery. As far as Cordis goes, I would say that we still have additional levels of inventory visibility that we would like to see. But we are going to \u2013 we feel a lot better where we are today, as you can imagine, by having the visibility that we got. The biggest area of challenge that we have is not so much in our own systems to seeing inventory visibility. It's in our consigned inventory. And so that's really where we have to take it to the next level is around the consigned inventory to get better visibility there to make sure we don't have any additional write-off concerns in that part. One other thing I would say too is that back to the Patient Recovery in general, those products don't have expiration dates where the Cordis products do have expiration dates and that's what's creating some of the inventory challenges. It's not just that you have over inventory potentially, but if you have some that are expiring, you're going to need to reserve those. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And that's helpful. Thank you. And then for the $0.16 of client investments that you've been planning on and opioids for fiscal 2018, have those occurred yet or not? Will they occur in 4Q or will they push into fiscal 2019? And then are those recurring in nature? Like will we see those continue indefinitely? Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Dave, I'll take that question. So as we indicated before in the second half of fiscal 2018, we've accounted for about $0.08 related to customer investments. And with the Optum repricing, with the Optum extension, we have utilized probably half of that, most of it in Q4. We continue to look at all opportunities to expand relationships with our customers. And as it relates to how we should think about that going forward, I think that Mike alluded to our expectations going forward, especially in 2019 as it relates to the normal cycle of renewals of certain customers in 2019. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: And as far as the rest of the $0.16, the other $0.08, the tax component, we talk about that part has basically been spent. And then the piece of opioid as we said would be moved back into our second half. So we saw some spend in Q3 and would expect the rest of the spend to happen in Q4. So really the vast majority of the $0.16 did get spent in \u2013 will get spent this year other than a portion of the customer initiatives. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : Next question from John Kreger in William Blair. Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Courtney Owens on for John Kreger. So I notice you just called out some of the differences from an inventory perspective between Patient Recovery and Cordis. But just kind of outside of that we're just trying to see what's significantly different about the Patient Recovery business in the sense that like what have you learned since your integration with Cordis to avoid some of the issues that you're seeing with Cordis right now as it relates to the Patient Recovery business? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. A couple things. Again back to the inventory. This nature of having inventory with expiration dates, the fact that it's consigned inventory in Cordis versus not consigned in Patient Recovery. I think we clearly underestimated the needs and requirements of being able to have inventory visibility at a deeper level than we anticipate or understood that we would have through that process. So while that's a learning for us in Cordis, it's not a big deal, as we said, for Patient Recovery because it's not as much U.S. and it doesn't have \u2013 or it's not much outside U.S and it doesn't have expiration dates. So while it's a learning, I would say that's not one that's a hugely valuable one to us for Patient Recovery. I think the areas where we really had some learnings was around estimating what our cost structure would be. When we came out with Cordis early on in our quarter and recently we've been saying that we underestimated what our costs would be stand up the ex-U.S. infrastructure and to work through all of that. And we knew that going into Patient Recovery which we've now have since end of July of this past year, and so we estimated our costs, we were much more realistic about setting those up and understanding what it would be to do that. But I think that's probably the biggest one is understanding what it would take to do it. The good news too is by already having established relationships with third-party logistics companies, setting up some of the infrastructure, again, outside the U.S., we were able to leverage that same infrastructure and so some of the learnings around how to contract and what we need from those service providers also was helpful. Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Next question? Operator : Next question from George Hill in RBC. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. First is a housekeeping question for Jorge. With the Optum renewal, is there a prior period adjustment retroactive that impacts Q4 that artificially weighs on results? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No. There's no retroactive adjustment there. We just signed the agreement and the accounting and the economic impact is all prospective. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then like I guess I'm going to hit Cordis one more time. If you bucket the three challenges, one I'll call operational, two I'll call competitive, three I'll call kind of end market challenges, as we look out to 2019, I guess can you rank order the challenges? It sounds like most of them are operational which you guys should be able to fix. I guess I would just ask you to address the other two because we've talked a lot about the inventory system. I guess talk about the market and talk about competitive as it relates to the outlook for that business. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously it is a competitive marketplace but we feel good about our ability to compete in the marketplace. And then one of the things that we're doing that I think is helping our competitiveness in the marketplace, besides some of the great work Jon and team are doing around the commercial structure, our ability to bundle with other products, our ability and training with our sales reps, is also by adding to the portfolio so we have more in the bag. And as I mentioned, our addition of a drug-eluting stent has been an important component of our commercial competitive ability to compete going forward. And we feel really good about the quality and the acceptance of that stent and expect that to be something that we would see growing going forward. And we're actively working with other players out there to look at other products that we can add to our bag in a very capital efficient way by partnering with folks to bring them in. So I like our competitive positioning. And part of where that's indicative is this is a business that historically had not grown in a long, long time. And so far year to date, we are seeing growth year over year in our top line. So where I get encouraged is we're seeing a top line that is \u2013 while we still think there's opportunities to grow more and do some things, we're seeing it actually grow year over year which is different than history. We're seeing a bag that's expanding. We just haven't been able to turn it through to a drop through to the bottom line because of the inventory reserves and the operational issues that we have. So for me, clearly it's the operational issues that are the biggest concern. And I think we have the right folks and the right plans in place. It's going to take some time because we don't want to do anything rash that would hurt our momentum on the top line. But the team is very focused with detailed work plans, metrics and timelines to get after getting this business back on track. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And if I could just maybe sneak in a third one real quick for Jorge. Jorge, just what volume levels do we need to see in generics given the depreciation that we're seeing in generics? What kind of volume growth do we need to see to grow EBIT in that segment? Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Well that is a level of detail that we normally don't get into. And as we have discussed a number of times, there is a lot of variables that come together to generate growth when you think about ASP, units, Red Oak. So we look at the totality of all those variables when we try to estimate the growth. So there's multiple combinations of all of those variables that result in either growth or decline. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Next question please. Operator : Comes from Brian Tanquilut in Jefferies. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick question. As we think about generic pricing and your qualitative comments about FY 2019 EPS, what are your views on or thoughts on where that trends? Or what assumption are you making as you made those comments on EPS growth? And also how would you characterize generic inflation expectations today versus 2016 calendar? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take a stab at that. I think a couple things. We're not ready to give any specifics around 2019 at this time and where we would expect it to be. Right now we would assume that we'd continue to see deflation. But at what level, it's still something we're evaluating. Again, what I can emphasize is that what we've seen versus last year and what we've seen sequentially, we have seen generic deflation moderating. But as Jorge said, not only within generics do you have to understand all the various components, but when you're repricing and thinking through deals with customers, you have all of the components to take into account which would be branded mix, generic mix, specialty mix and all of those as we reprice. And so I think one of the things that we need to do and we are continuing to do is assess the overall on all the buckets within our customer go to market strategies and pricing in order to manage our profitability appropriately going forward and drive growth. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC : And Mike just a follow-up to that. As we think about your repricings, are you seeing any ability to increase compliance rate requirements? Or what kind of leverage do you have in these contract negotiations as to your price? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, it really depends on the customer. As you know, some customers are already buying 100% of their product from us. And so it's obviously then hard to take that up above that, but we do have other customers that aren't buying all their generics from us. And as you can imagine, any time we go to work with a customer, we look at all of the components that they could buy from us including consumer health, brand and generics and look to partner with them so that if they would like to see a price decrease, what can they give us in terms of additional volume that might help offset some of the impact that we feel? So we continue to see that as an opportunity for us to penetrate not only in generics, but in other areas like consumer health. We'll continue to push on that. And I would say typically in most contracts on renewals, we do tend to see improved penetration of generics and oftentimes private label and other products. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : Comes from Eric Percher in Nephron Research. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. I may stay on generics because I have a feeling the stocks will react to the commentary today. I want to make sure I understand. There was a comment that there was a negative impact from generic program performance. I know later you said that your expectation was for substantial improvement. You didn't quite see that but you did see improvement this year. I know you also said that Red Oak was strong. So I just want to come back to that simple comment about negative impact from generic program performance and was that just relative to your expectation for the year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, that was relative to our expectation for the year that when we put together what we are seeing in generic deflation which, as you said was moderating but not moderating quite as much as we expected, Red Oak's over performance, then all the combination of wins, losses, penetration, et cetera, generic launches. When we put that all together, the net impact of that is that our generic programs was net negative but again, still better than we expected it to be. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Steven Valiquette in Barclays. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning, Mike and Jorge. My line dropped earlier so thanks for fitting me back in here. Just on the topic around the FY 2018 guidance around generic price deflation, obviously your guidance is sell-side based. But if we do focus on the buy-side generic pricing for a moment, is there any update on the whole discussion around the generic manufacturer portfolio rationalization and whether that's creating any changes in pricing trend so far in calendar 2018? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah. I wouldn't say that we've seen any material impact yet from that. We have \u2013 as you can imagine, the Red Oak team leads all of those discussions for us and again, glad we have such a talented group up there to be able to do that for us. They constantly are working with manufacturers and we want to work with manufacturers. And we understand some may need or want to discontinue certain lines. We work with them on the timing and at the same time, knowing that we're focused on getting the best everyday cost possible, we'll look for other folks to maybe put them back into those products if we need to in order to make sure we're maintaining the cost. So at this point in time I would say we're not really seeing any material impact. And going forward, I feel like with Red Oak, both its talent and its game plan, we feel like we're positioned well to compete in an environment and still be effective at getting after cost, even as manufacturers look at reducing their overall product lines. Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So it sounds like if deflation is moderating, that's not really the driver of it. It's basically other factors within the overall generic portfolio. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think from us, the deflation component again goes back to the sell side. So that's more based on the competitive environment. As far as Red Oak being able to get after cost and find better cost for us, it's not seemed so far impacting their ability to go \u2013 continue to lower and drive lower cost for us. Thanks for the question. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: All right. So I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to get on the call today. We gave you a lot of information today to digest. We hope you found it helpful. And Jorge and I and the IR team look forward to talking to many of you today and over the next coming days. Take care, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead. Lisa Capodici : Thank you, Silvia. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez. During the call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full-year results, and update on our strategic initiatives and FY19 guidance. Today\u2019s press release and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the fourth quarter and full-year can be found in the schedules, attached to our press release. In addition, during the call we will provide forward-looking guidance for FY19 on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis, due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share. During the Q&A portion of our call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call. So, feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Kaufmann. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I am glad you could join us. As Lisa mentioned, I\u2019ll start with some comments on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 and then spend a few minutes on the strategic initiatives we have underway to best position Cardinal Health for the future. We have many opportunities ahead to build on Cardinal Health\u2019s strengths as a critical contributor to the healthcare industry. I feel good about the progress we are making. We encountered a couple of unexpected challenges in fiscal \u201818, and we are addressing those issues. We are on track and well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Overall, for the quarter, our non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 came in higher than expected, due to a lower tax rate. Revenue for the quarter reached $35 billion, up 7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $465 million. For the year, non-GAAP EPS was $5 on revenue of a $137 billion, up more than 5%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.6 billion, and operating cash flow was $2.8 billion.  Turning to the Pharma segment, I\u2019ll make a few comments. For the quarter, we saw revenue growth from both existing and new customers. In PD, while Red Oak continued to have a positive impact, our generic program remained a headwind overall. As it relates to brand drugs, the contribution was better than expected this quarter, but we know this is an evolving marketplace. We provide significant value to our manufacturing partners, and we will continue to work closely with them during this evolution. Both the Specialty and Nuclear businesses had a strong finish to the year. Specialty continues to be a standout, once again delivering robust, double-digit revenue and profit growth, while nuclear also performed well, generating top line growth and an even stronger performance on the bottom line. As we enter fiscal 2019, our focus is on taking the necessary steps to address the changing industry dynamics to position the pharma distribution business for a long-term growth. You can see from our guidance and comments that we do not expect PD to grow operating earnings in fiscal 2019. Customer contract renewals, some of which occurred in FY18 and generic deflation are expected to be the largest headwinds. Our team is actively working on several initiatives to return this business to our more typical upward trajectory. We recognize that industry pricing dynamics, both upstream and downstream are likely to change, and they should. And we are extremely skillful at adapting to these types of changes as we have done it before. Turning to the Medical segment, well, Jorge will discuss the specific items that affected the segment\u2019s earnings. Let me share a few highlights. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the Patient Recovery business. Our integration of this business is currently on track. We exited our TSAs with Medtronic for North America, Latin America and the Global Supply Chain in late July. And the team is continuing to move forward on exiting from the TSAs in other global regions in late calendar 2018 and early 2019. At Cordis, we continued to see top line growth. We\u2019re making progress in executing on our plan to resolve the inventory and cost challenges we\u2019ve previously discussed. And the team is moving with a great sense of urgency to implement our turnaround plan. I am pleased to report that service levels are significantly improved. And we have the enhanced inventory visibility we need to run this business more effectively. As we said in May, it is going to take some time for us to see the benefit of these actions on the bottom line. However, we remain confident that Cordis is on a path to profitable growth by the end of fiscal year 2019. At naviHealth, we have now completed the sale of a 55% interest in this business to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. As you know, naviHealth has been a strong performer. We believe that this new structure will provide naviHealth with the resources needed to better support and accelerate its growth trajectory while at the same time, allowing us to focus on our larger businesses and strategy. We are excited to have CD&R as a partner in positioning this business for future growth and success. Finally, both our distribution services and Cardinal Health at-Home businesses performed well. Both grew earnings double digits during the quarter, driven by strong demand for their services. So, in summary, I remain confident in the prospects of our Medical segment, which has expanded our reach across the continuum of care and provide us with new avenues to enhance our value to customers and patients. I am also very pleased with the progress Jon Giacomin has made in strengthening his management team, focusing on execution and changing our go-to-market strategies and culture to drive product growth. While this will take some time, he has the right team in place, and they are working hard to achieve their goals. Now, let me switch gears a little. As I look back over the past five years, we made great progress on three critical strategic priorities. First, recognizing that the overwhelming percentage of prescriptions were filled with generic pharmaceuticals we knew that we needed a best-in-class large scale generics program; secondly, as specialty pharmaceuticals were becoming the focus for innovation and patient breakthroughs, we knew what was important for us to be a larger, more relevant player in this space with deep clinical experience and insight; and thirdly, with customers looking for cost efficiencies, we saw the opportunity to expand our medical products portfolio to leverage and complement our excellent medical distribution capabilities. So, today, we have a generics business that is now a leader with our 50-50 JV with CVS. We have both significant volume and a highly experienced team with industry-leading strategy and analytics skills. We have a specialty business that has grown from a $1 billion, mostly blood products business to a diversified specialty business with greater than $15 billion in revenue that competes successfully for many types of service with those manufacturers and providers. And finally, we have a wide breadth of Cardinal Health products through the expansion of our historical line and the additions of Cordis and Patient Recovery. We have a high-quality, significant, and cost effective portfolio we can offer to our customers. We are now both, a strong distribution and medical products company. Today, we are squarely focused on driving the greatest value from this attractive portfolio of assets. At the same time, as you recall from the third quarter discussion, I indicated that we were undertaking a comprehensive top-down, bottom-up review of our business focusing on three key elements. One, our business mix and balance across the portfolio; two, our cost structure; and three, our capital deployment strategy. Of course, in addition to these three areas, execution remains a top priority across the board. Let me take a minute to address each of these. In terms of the portfolio, as you know, we divested our China distribution business on February 1st, having concluded that we would need to make substantial expenditures to drive future growth and allowing us to monetize our investment and focus our resources. Then, in June, we announced the naviHealth transaction, creating a valuable partnership, designed to accelerate growth. These are just two examples of how we are always looking at our overall portfolio and assessing, where and when to take addition action that will optimize our performance and deliver the greatest value. As it relates to our cost structure, here too, we have made considerable progress. We are executing on near-term initiatives that will deliver at least $100 million of annualized cost savings and working on others that will deliver significantly more. The largest piece of the near-term savings involves a significant reduction in our workforce, which is mostly complete. This reduction will have the benefit of simplifying our reporting structure, while more closely aligning us with current industry dynamics. We are also working on a more detailed plan to optimize our go-to-market strategies and other elements of our cost structure to deliver additional savings. Driving organic growth is a top priority for us. So, you can expect that we\u2019ll be investing some of these savings back into the business. Finally, regarding our capital deployment approach, we are being very-disciplined. This approach emphasizes reinvestment in the business for future growth, as well as returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Any M&A in the near-term will be limited and focused. We believe that this approach, along with continued emphasis on financial flexibility, will deliver growth and long-term value. As I hope you can see, work is well underway in each of our priority areas. Let me be perfectly clear about the road ahead. I am not wed to the past. Everything is on the table, when it comes to driving long-term growth, delivering shareholder returns, and serving our customers. We have a great team, the right plans in place to move forward, and we are executing. All of us are committed to being disciplined, with a laser focus on achieving results in the months and years ahead. Looking now to fiscal year 2019. Based on the factors we\u2019ve communicated, we expect consolidated Company revenue growth in the mid single digits and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.15. This is consistent with what we said in May, adjusting for the impact of the lower tax rate this quarter. Jorge will give you more details in his remarks. In closing, I want to thank each of our employees for their hard work in fiscal 2018, and their continued commitment to Cardinal Health. We are fortunate to have such a talented and dedicated team. We have work to do, but we are well-positioned for the road ahead. Together, we look forward to continuing to evolve and grow our business and to further enhancing our value as a vital part of the healthcare system. With that, let me turn it over to Jorge to discuss our financials and outlook for fiscal year 2019. Jorge Gomez : Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Today, I\u2019ll cover three topics. First, I will review some key elements of our fourth quarter results; second, I\u2019ll share additional information on our operational and strategic initiatives; and third, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for fiscal 2019. To allow ample time for Q&A, my comments on these results will be focused primarily on the fourth quarter. Our full-year results can be found in our press release. On slide four, Mike already covered revenue and EPS. So, I will give you additional commentary on our financial items. Gross margin grew 7% in the quarter, driven by Patient Recovery. We saw increased SG&A this quarter, primarily due to acquisitions and incremental 401(k) plan contribution. This SG&A increase is not one we anticipate will continue as we are laser-focused on making our expenses in a very -- on managing our expenses in a very-disciplined way. I will cover specific initiatives later in my presentation. Net interest and other expense was about $107 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior years was primarily driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 12%, which was substantially lower than what we had modeled for the quarter. Let me take a moment to further explain. The Q4 tax rate was driven by onetime tax benefit derived from the restructuring of international legal entities for Cordis. We took decisive actions over the last three months to address the tax rate pressure we mentioned in Q3 that was related to Cordis financial performance in certain jurisdictions. This onetime tax item was a result of the faster-than-anticipated progress we made in Q4. We are continuing to work on this front and expect to complete most of the specialties plan in Q1 fiscal 2019. This ongoing work on Cordis related legal entity restructuring, puts us in a likely position to benefit in fiscal 2019 from the U.S. tax reform to the extent we originally estimated. Fourth quarter diluted average shares outstanding were approximately $312 million, about $7 million fewer shares than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. During Q4, we completed $100 million of share repurchases, bringing our full-year repurchases to $550 million. We have about $900 million remaining under our Board approved share repurchase program. In Q4, we also recognized a $1.4 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge resulted from our standard annual impairment testing process and is primarily related to the Cordis business, including its operational challenges we discussed previously. Our continued focus on cash flow generation and working capital management resulted in fiscal 2018 operating cash flow of approximately $2.8 billion. This cash flow performance also reflected timing of vendor payments of roughly $400 million that were accelerated in fiscal 2017 and subsequently normalized in fiscal 2018. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of June with about $560 million held outside the U.S. Now, I will add some detail for second performance found on slide five. Pharmaceutical segment profit for Q4 was $416 million versus $505 million in the prior years. The decrease was in line with our expectations for the quarter in light of the generic program performance we mentioned in May. To be clear, during the quarter, we saw a continuation of a stable generic market dynamics. I\u2019d like to highlight that the trends in our Specialty business are strong. We continue to execute well operationally and commercially with strong top and bottom-line growth. Industry dynamics are positive as well. Continuing with the Medical segment on slide six. Segment revenue grew over 14%. This increase was driven primarily by contributions from Patient Recovery. The fundamentals of this business are solid. Segment profit decreased 17% or $24 million to $114 million in Q4. This decrease was driven by the performance of Cardinal Health Brand products, primarily Cordis as well as compensation-related items. This was mostly upset by contributions from acquisitions. Now, I\u2019d like to direct you to slide 12, which connects Mike\u2019s commentary around strategy to economics of the initiative that we are implementing to build a future growth. In May, we told you that we\u2019re beginning an operational review. Here, we list elements of this phased, disciplined action plan to simply our business, reduce cost and invest for growth. I will walk through some of our current areas of focus and progress we have made. Regarding cost structure, we recently implemented enterprise-wide cost reduction measures, which provide annualized savings in excess of $100 million in fiscal \u201819. We\u2019re also beginning a zero base budgeting journey which we expect will deliver more than $200 million in annualized savings by fiscal \u201820. This fundamental shift in mindset will allow us thoughtfully prioritize, invest, and drive earnings growth through cost discipline now and in the future. The Cordis repositioning is progressing well with our new leadership team in place. The team is moving with a sense of urgency to implement initiatives that will enhance the efficiency and profitability of this business. In Q4, Cordis continued to see topline growth. As we said last quarter, we expect that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of fiscal \u201819. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we are making good progress to resolve the Cordis-related negative tax dynamic we experienced in Q3. Related to Patient Recovery, I\u2019m pleased to report that we achieved our fiscal \u201818 accretion goal. This business continues to perform in line with our expectations and we expect fiscal \u201819 EPS accretion for Patient Recovery to be consistent with the goals we outlined previously. Regarding the pharma model, we are actually evaluating multiple upstream and downstream opportunities. We continue to have discussions with branded manufacturer partners. We are also evaluating our contracting models in light of some of the shifts in bid environment. We\u2019re actively managing our portfolio and expanding critical partnerships. This has translated into a few key business decisions. We divested our China distribution business, established a strategic partnership for naviHealth and expanded our relationship with Optum. We are diligently assessing additional opportunities. Finally, with respect to capital deployment, our priorities to deliver growth and long-term value are as follows : First, we\u2019re investing into business for future growth; second, returning cash to shareholders; and third, focusing on limited and disciplined M&A. As we execute these priorities, we will maintain financial flexibility. With the right change agents in place throughout our global leadership team, we continue to implement these strategies and see the value thread of the enterprise. Some of these areas have short-term roadways to growth, while others may take some time. But, we wanted to give you some context around these initiatives, because we are executing action plans now to address each of them. Next, I\u2019ll discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. Our full-year enterprise financial expectations can be found on the slide 14. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate low single digit percentage growth in our consolidated Company revenue. We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.15. On our Q3 call, we indicated we would see modest EPS growth in fiscal 2019, based on the expectation that we would finish fiscal 2018 between $4.85 and $4.95. As we just discussed, in Q4, we saw the impact of the large one-time discrete tax item. Although this item impacts our year-over-year percentage change, it does not change our view of fiscal 2019. While we may see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 25% and 28% for fiscal 2019, which reflects the full year benefit from U.S. tax reform, as well as the resolution of our prior Cordis legal entity structure issues, which I mentioned earlier. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be between 302 and 307 million shares. Interest and other expense should be between $340 million and $360 million. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $360 million to $390 million. Now, for the segment assumptions on slide 15. For our Pharma segment, we anticipate low single digit revenue growth. For segment profit, we expect a high single, to low double digit percentage decline, due to a headwind related to customer renewals, generic programs and the loss of PharMerica. However, our specialty business is expected to deliver another year of strong growth. We expect tampered brand inflation, which we are modeling to be in the mid single digits. We expect generic deflation on the sales side to follow the pattern it did in fiscal 2018, where the environment was competitive but stable. We anticipate Red Oak will continue to provide a year-over-year benefit, but less than in fiscal 2018. Due to the uncertainty around the New York State opioid assessment, we have not included any impact from this item in our fiscal 2019 assumptions. For the Medical segment, we expect low single digit percentage revenue growth, in line with market growth. We also anticipate mid to high single digit segment profit growth for the year, driven by projected contributions from patient recovery.  In closing, we have made significant progress in identifying the path toward growth in fiscal 2019. We are also diligently implementing initiatives that will position Cardinal Health for a future of long-term success. We will continue to share more about this in the coming months. With that, I\u2019d like to open the line and invite your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So, I want to unpack some of the generic commentary you\u2019ve made over the course of the call. You talked about stabilizing performance in the business. You talked about Red Oak being less of a contributor going forward. As you think about the moving piece of the competitive dynamic, where are the areas where you\u2019re gaining upside opportunities on generics? And what are the -- is it competitive dynamics, is it sourcing or what are the biggest areas that are creating those incremental headwinds on a year-over-year basis as you think about how generics play forward in the market against the commentary of that competitive but stable? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks for the question, Michael. I would say, as you know, there are several components, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, to our generics program. The ones that we continue to feel very good about is Red Oak. We continue to expect that to be a positive for us, just less of a positive then we saw this prior year. We continue to see generic launches as a positive, although we see them as a pretty small set of launches this year. We continue to see overall generic volumes to be growing for us as we\u2019ve been able to work with some customers to buy more generics from us and from recent wins. Then, the biggest offset being the generic deflation, which we continue to see the market being stable compared to where it was this prior year. But, based on all of the other facts, the net of all that for our generics program, we would still expect to be a headwind. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for all the comments. So, Mike and Jorge, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the branded inflation assumptions. You talked about mid single digit assumption factored into the guide. Can you clarify what cadence is it, what are you assuming for branded inflation between now and December, and then for the second half of the year? I mean, from of the comments we\u2019ve heard from manufacturers, it seems that we\u2019re unlikely to see much in terms of inflation between now and year-end. So, I just want to better understand whether you\u2019re assuming high single -- mid to high single digit in second half of your fiscal year versus assumption for the first half of the year? So, that\u2019s the first part of the question. And then, the second part of it, and obviously you are guiding for fiscal year 2019. But, when we think about the business and we think of everything you\u2019re doing, do you think that in fiscal year 2020 and beyond, you can return to growth in the distribution segment? Mike Kaufmann : Great. Thanks for the questions, Ricky. On branded inflation, I\u2019ll start there, couple of different things. I\u2019ll step back first and just say that we really believe that what we do for manufacturers and what\u2019s often forgotten with customers is incredibly valuable. We are a very important part, as you know, of the very secure and transparent supply chain where industry service levels have really been near a 100%. So, I think both customers and manufacturers find what we do to be incredibly valuable and I would expect that going forward. As I think about branded inflation, let me give you just a few comments. First of all, remember that less than 10% of our branded TSA margins are contingent to inflation, and we are continuing to have active conversations with those manufacturers that still have a contingent portion. And so, we will continue to look at that and specifically look at reducing risk where possible on that. That being said, July is typically our second most important month, when it comes to branded inflation. Now, that being said, it is a far distance second to January in our Q3. So, while it\u2019s the second largest month, it\u2019s significantly less than January. And so, it was a little light, what we saw in July was light. And again, we heard what you heard, which is branded manufacturers potentially waiting until end of calendar year. So, at this point in time, it is -- we still expect our Q3 to be our strongest quarter, because that\u2019s when our contingent manufacturers tend to take their price increases. We continue to have discussions with them. And while we are forecasting overall branded inflation to be slightly less than what we incurred as an actual this year, a significant and vast majority we expect to happen in our Q3. So, it\u2019s going to be probably honesty hard for us to update whether it\u2019s going to be neutral, tailwind or headwind until we really see what happens in the first part of January. As far as giving you a little bit of size to that, I would try to be at least helpful here in the sense that if branded inflation versus our current assumption, which I said was a little bit lower than what we did last year -- than action we incurred this last year, if it\u2019s just a few percentage points off, we would expect to be able to absorb that within our current guidance range. Now, if it continued to be zero or very low single digits for the whole year, then that might create some type of a headwind. But, we think that we have enough room in our current guidance range if it\u2019s just off by a few percentage points. Moving to your question on FY20, at this point in time, we just gave FY19. We really have a lot of strategic initiatives underway that are early in the process. And there is just a lot of variables that continue to involve, one of them being what we just talked about brand inflation. So, at this point, I\u2019m not going to make any comments on \u201820 other than we\u2019re focused on positioning Cardinal right for the future. Next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. It\u2019s James on for Charles. Could you maybe provide us with greater visibility regarding the impact of inventory to Cordis, maybe help us quantify what the write-down was this quarter, last quarter, and perhaps how much is assumed in fiscal 2019? Jorge Gomez : Yes. This is Jorge. I\u2019ll take that question. We have not provided specific numbers around inventory write-offs, but what I could tell you is that the team has made tremendous progress in fiscal 2108, in terms of improving our demand planning system, improving our global supply chain platform. And as we go into fiscal 2019, we believe we are in a much better position to manage our inventory levels across our global supply chain. So, I\u2019d say, we are making good progress. The trends are moving in the right direction. And it\u2019s one of the key elements of our turnaround plan four Cordis. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And one of your peers recently noted that they\u2019ve renewed notable customer contracts, but didn\u2019t expect that to be a margin headwind. In contrast, the repricing of Optum is a headwind for Cardinal. Can you maybe provide us with some color on some of the components of a customer contract that could account for this disparity, and are there any notable customer pricing assumed in fiscal 2019? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question; couple of things to keep in mind. Each customer is very unique until of itself. There has been multiple times over years where we\u2019ve renewed customers with very minimal year-over-year margin impact, because we\u2019ve either been able -- because they\u2019ve either been very low priced in market already at the time of the renewal, or that we\u2019ve been able to find ways to grow other parts of their mix to offset some of those. So, I think that it\u2019s hard to compare individual contract. Each contract often is at different times in its lifecycle, different percentages of brands and generics that you have and very other items that can affect the mix. So for us, when we look at our mix and where we are, the length of term of our contracts, our ability to go after additional mix in that, we do continue for us to see customer contract renewals to be a headwind for FY 2019. Just a couple quick points on that. Many of those contract renewals have already occurred in 2018. So, what you are seeing is the impact, one of the notable ones is Optum, which is a customer that went from a three-year renewal kind of a cycle to a longer term six-year renewal. And we\u2019ve agreed to work with them in a more strategic way. And so, we made some investments working with them as a partner going forward. And as far as any other detail on customer contract renewals, we don\u2019t like to go into any detail on specific counts at this point in time. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Ross Muken : Thanks, everybody. So, maybe just trying to understand one thing on the quarter. So, if I look at sort of the segment results for Medical and for Pharma, it kind of implies on the corporate side, larger loss than normal. Is that sort of some of the compensation charges you were talking about? I\u2019m just trying to figure out and net those out, and figure out what the true underlying margins were and how they net to the total for the quarter? Jorge Gomez : Good morning, Ross. Thanks for the question. Yes. When we step back and look at the performance of the segments in Q4, we actually operationally, we landed pretty much where we thought we were going to in Q4. You\u2019re right, in the corporate segment, we have -- there\u2019s a large expense amount that is related to the 401(k) contribution that I mentioned on my prepared remarks. So, that\u2019s what reconciles the performance of the segments to the total performance of the Company in the quarter. Ross Muken : Got it. And so, then, if medical was truly a little bit step three for the quarter, I guess, how are you just thinking about the cadence? Because obviously, we\u2019re coming up against the inventory charges in the first part of last year, but then some of the restructuring in quarters is going to take some time. And then, you stated, the Patient Recovery is kind of on plan. And so, are we expecting kind of a step-up over the balance of next year and then the normal seasonality? I\u2019m just trying to get that Medical cadence maybe a little bit more finely tuned. Jorge Gomez : Yes. I think medical in Q4 is hard to look at that and see those numbers as representative of the cadence that we\u2019ll see next year. The other element we had in Q4 for Medical was the push down, the allocation of enterprise-wide compensation entry that happened in the quarter. So, when you combine that with the amount of inventory write-offs that we had in Q3, Q4, that brings the margins for medical in Q4 below the levels we would expect to see for that business. So, when we think about 2019, we should see a lift in those margins, given the non-recurring nature of some of those items. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Robert Jones : Thanks for the questions. I guess, Mike, just starting on the EBIT guide for Pharma to be down high single digit to low double digit. I know you\u2019ve walked through some of the headwinds obviously. But, I was hoping maybe you could just give us a little bit more of a breakdown, maybe rank order off the headwinds that you\u2019re expecting or baking into guidance in 2019? If you could just talk a little bit about generic deflation versus the lower branded and inflation expectations, the contract expiry, and then the offset from some of the cost cutting? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. So, why don\u2019t I just do this to be helpful, and you\u2019ll be able to figure out which pieces are specifically Medical, Pharma or something that might be captured at a top end. I\u2019ll just go through all of the puts and takes kind of in descending order for each to try to be helpful. First one on the outside, Patient Recovery, year-over-year accretion is going to be number one for us. Number two is going to be growth in our existing businesses with Specialty continuing to be expected at double-digit growth. Tax is going to be third for us. We expect the tax rate, as Jorge mentioned, to be in the 25% to 28% range versus roughly the 29. Shares would be next. The discretionary 401(k) contribution, which we don\u2019t expect to have next year at this point in time; and then, next would be the net benefit from the cost structure initiatives. Remember that I told you that we expected annualized savings of over $100 million this year, but we are reinvesting a large portion of those back into the business to grow and drive future growth. So, those are kind of the puts. And the takes would be the divestiture of China and naviHealth. Those -- P&L impact of both of those are -- obviously, China has gone and naviHealth is much lower the next year. Customer renewals would be the second piece. And again, remember, a lot of those have already been done in \u201818. And then, generics program would be next. PharMerica would be after that. And then last would be the tampered brand inflation that Jorge said. So, specifically for us in Pharma, it\u2019s going to be the customer renewals, generics, PharMerica America and brand. Robert Jones : I appreciate all that, Mike. I guess, just on that last point, your brand doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s as big a headwind as some of the other issues. But, you mentioned talking to some of the branded manufacturers about potentially changing fee structures. Just curious how have those discussions been received and what\u2019s their willingness to renegotiate the way that you guys get paid? Mike Kaufmann : We have been having discussions with manufacturers. In fact, not only discussions, as I mentioned, some of the ones that were contingent last year have been moved to non-contingent this year, and those have gone well. The reasons for the headwind year-over-year is essentially we\u2019re expecting a little bit lower inflation rate. And as I mentioned some of those converted. So, there is some timing of when you go off of the contingent to non-contingent. So, those are really the things driving the year-over-year headwind for Pharma. But conversations have been going well. I think what I would say about them is that I\u2019ve not had any manufacturer that\u2019s not recognized that if that is contingent that and if they\u2019re not going to be able to have expected inflation that they don\u2019t understand that we\u2019re going to need to renegotiate for higher rates. And if some of the other things being talked about in the marketplace such as changes to WAC prices occur. I think all of the manufacturers understand that there needs to be discussions and that the way we get compensated will need to be changed. They are negotiations, so they\u2019re -- it\u2019s always hard to predict how those will go. But, as far as having the right attitude to want to work with us, having the willingness to work with us, understanding that we provide significant value and that it\u2019s the best way to get to market, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt from any of the manufacturers or ourselves that that\u2019s the right thing to do and that we would expect to work through these. Thanks. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Erin Wright : Thanks. Can you speak to the rationale behind the naviHealth partnership/divestiture? If that business was growing nicely for you and how does this -- put into perspective, how you\u2019re thinking about other potential divestitures? And are there any other exits, I guess contemplated in your guidance at this time, I guess how do you envision your business mix evolving here? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question, Erin. A couple of things. We really like the naviHealth business. But as we look to a couple of things that were important, one is there is a lot of changes in that space, and we knew there was going to be significant investment needed in that space, particularly over the next 12 to 18, 12 to 24 months. And we knew that all of that investment would be not only impact on the P&L but even more importantly an impact on our ability to focus on the things that will drive these for more value in our Medical segment. And so, we began to explore opportunities, the potential for us to be able to, if we could in a disciplined way, get back what we had invested in the business but still retain some type of ownership with the path back as opportunity to take it back, if we wanted to over the midterm, then that might be something worth doing. And so, we did that. We were able to accomplish. We were able to exit the business and get back more than what we had invested, as we all as retain 45% ownership and work with a really good partner like CD&R who we think is really well positioned to invest significantly in the business over the next 12 to 24 months. And then, both in terms of hiring people and talent, is a way for us to do this. So, we really think that this maximizes the growth potential of naviHealth and really allows us to stay focused on the big key drivers for us in Medical, which is turning around Cordis and landing the patient recovery business and driving the rest of our business. So, that was the overall reasons behind that. As far as the other decision on our portfolio, as you can you imagine, we can\u2019t talk about those specifically right now. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s nothing off the table. We continue to look at our portfolio. Each business needs to perform well. And we need to feel that we\u2019re an advantaged owner. And with those types of lenses, we will continue to take a look at our portfolio. Erin Wright : Okay... Mike Kaufmann : Next question -- go ahead, Erin. Erin Wright : No, just on the patient recovery accretion goal, I guess, can you quickly just mention the accomplishments there and where we stand with that topic process of exiting the TSAs and how we should think about the financial implications of transitioning those off? Jorge Gomez : Yes. Thanks, Erin. This is Jorge. So, with respect to accretion goals, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we delivered what we committed to delivering in fiscal 2018, and we are on track also to be in excess above of the accretion that we have forecasted for fiscal 2019. So, things are going well in that part of the performance of the business. With respect to TSA exits, we just began in the last couple of weeks the exit of the TSAs in North America. It is a complicated process that is going well. It will take several weeks to bring everything in line and have -- and make sure that all the processes are working as expected. But, the early indications are positive. After we complete the exit from the North American TSA exits, we will move on to OUS TSA exits, and in the fall, we\u2019ll begin to exit the arrangements that we have in place for Europe and Asia Pacific. All the preparation work for those exits is also on track. And we feel good about the ultimate outcome of those transitions. Mike Kaufmann : Next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from David Larsen from Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. David Larsen : Hi. Jorge talked about $0.16 of higher cost tied to client investments in the back half of fiscal 2018. Are we through those or are those complete? And were those tied mainly to renewals? Thanks. And then, also the opioid investment, are you through that as well? Thanks. Jorge Gomez : Yes. Dave, thanks for the question. With respect to customer investments, yes, the amounts that we had contemplated to invest in fiscal 2018 were completed. And there was a combination of customer renewals and other type of initiatives that we have in place with key customers. Mike Kaufmann : As far as the opioids go, we continue to be committed to this. This is something really important to us as a company. We think that -- 10 years ago, we started doing our various programs that we have Generation Rx, and have been making investment steadily for over the last 10 years into this, both internally and externally. So, I don\u2019t see that changing. At this point grime, it\u2019s hard to predict what the level will be in 2019 versus 2018, but we will continue to make investments in opioids going forward because it\u2019s important to us. David Larsen : Okay. And then how more renewals do you have in fiscal 2019, like new renewals? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Since we don\u2019t go through specific customers, it\u2019s difficult for us to really give you any color on that other than of the renewal impact. A portion of it has already occurred in 2018. And then, the rest are those that we know have come up for that if contract expires or that we anticipate to renew early. So, it\u2019s just us looking at our entire portfolio as we do every year. But, other than that, I can\u2019t give any more detail. Next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from George Hill from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. George Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. I appreciate you getting me in and all my questions have been asked. I guess, Jorge, one for you would be I guess, can you give us the timing of the net realization of the cost savings programs kind of versus the gross numbers, because it seems like you guys are going to reinvest a lot? And then, my second follow-up will be -- I\u2019ll just ask and that was, it seems like we\u2019ve stopped talking about the gloves business. I guess, have we fixed kind of the sourcing issues there and is that business back on track? Jorge Gomez : Yes. Thanks, George. With respect to the savings, we have a number of initiatives going on. The most important one for fiscal 2019 is in the process of being executed right now. And so, I expect to have the majority of those savings in 2019, but not 100%. So, we will analyze as we go into fiscal 2020. But, the majority of those savings will be captured in 2019. There are elements around labor reduction, there are elements around changing spending policies, the is indirect procurement initiatives. All of those things are underway. So, we began to implement all of them. So, I expect a majority to be captured in fiscal 2019. But, there is going to be a piece that is going to annualize in fiscal 2020. With respect to gloves, this equation is not that different from what we have experienced in the last several quarters. So, as we go into 2019, I think, we will be kind of lapping the effect of the increased costs that we see -- that we began to see in early fiscal 2018. The team has continued to work on multiple fronts to address those cost concerns. I don\u2019t see it as a headwind going into 2019, at this point. But, we are trying to make sure that we do -- that we implement initiatives to actually improve and go back to our prior cost positions with those products. George Hill : Okay, great. Maybe just a quick follow-up on gloves. Is there a tariff step on there or s that just a cogs issue? Jorge Gomez : It\u2019s cogs for the most part. Yes. George Hill : Okay. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Eric Percher : Thank you. Mike, early on when you were talking about evaluating customer contracts and the way that you contract and you also were speaking to pricing, you said that things are likely to change and that they should change. Is the should change specific to the pricing environment or did you actually mean that to extend to the way that we\u2019re contracting today with manufacturers and do you see risk and opportunity from that? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I think it\u2019s both directions, but I\u2019ll -- probably little bit of different color. I think, upstream with manufacturers, as we continue to see manufacturers make different decisions on the amount of inflation they feel comfortable with, if they\u2019re contingent manufacturer, then, we\u2019re going to need to work through those contracts. If manufacturers also decide to make any decisions around WAC prices and reductions there, again, in order to make sure we get compensated for the value that we provide, then, those agreements also are going to have to change. And so, I think from that standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, we feel good about the conversations we\u2019re having. It\u2019s a little early to say how they\u2019re going to go because manufacturers are still assessing themselves what they\u2019re going to do, if anything, in those areas. And so, we\u2019ll continue to monitor it and continue to have discussions. But, if they do change WACs or they change their inflation assumptions, then the contracts should change, and they will change, and I believe we\u2019ll get through those. As far as downstream, I think it\u2019s a little bit differently in the sense that we need to continue to have the type of conversations we\u2019ve been having with customers to educate them on the changing marketplace and to make sure that we\u2019re looking to them to have those types of conversations, look at the mix that we have with those customers. Because at the end of the day, it all comes down to balancing your pricing with your cost structure. We\u2019re a little bit obviously out of balance which is why we\u2019ve had declines in our pharma distribution. And we\u2019re working both on the cost side and the customer side to get that more in balance. Eric Percher : And having been through the transition once before, it feels like the last couple of years of working both upstream and downstream have been heavy lifting. If there was a change and you needed to re-contract across because there had been a major shift in WAC. How difficult would that be if we know in 1/1/21 or at some stage you have to make that change? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. I think part of the -- last time I was the Head of Procurement we went through this, so I was in the middle of all of those DSA negotiations. And of the things that was helpful is that it kind of changed overnight that it was very clear that it was gone away with the situation in the marketplace. And so, every pharma manufacturer and all the distributors knew that things had to change because it was very obvious and everybody knew what has happened. In this case, I think there is still a lot of uncertainty, which is why I think you see a lot more conversation because the fact is that as what we did, 12, 13, 15 years ago has worked incredibly well. Manufacturers have seen near 100% service levels. Customers like it and have moved most all their purchasing directly into their distributors and love the prime vendor model. The supply chain is very secure. When was the last time you\u2019ve heard anything about a counterfeit hitting the system? So, I think everybody really likes the current system. It\u2019s transparent; it works. And so, I don\u2019t think -- one of the reasons why it\u2019s a little hard to predict is because we don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going, and it\u2019s working really well. That being said, if there is a date certain that something is going to change, that would be nice, because then we\u2019d all know that what we\u2019re working to. And I think the conversation, as such like I said, everybody understands that needs to be changed well, and it will. But, if it\u2019s overnight where it\u2019s more of a surprise, as you can imagine, like it was back then, it\u2019s probably going to be rocky for a few quarters, as we work through them. So, it\u2019s not, if we\u2019ll work through them; I am confident that we will. It just might be the timing could be a little off, if it\u2019s more of a surprise and less of kind of a date that\u2019s out there that we could work towards. Next question, please? Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You guys are pretty good about providing guidance on a quarterly basis, if your expected trends are a little bit different than what the Street maybe modeling. Given that you didn\u2019t make any comments today about F1Q 2019 and Street is showing some modest EPS growth year-over-year. I guess, I am just curious are you comfortable with the view of some EPS growth in F1Q 2019 or maybe not even focused on the quarterly cadence of your EPS growth here relative to what the Street might be modeling right now? Jorge Gomez : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me start. First thing I would say is, at this point, we don\u2019t want to be too granular about the quarterly guidance, because as you know there are elements that create some difficulty in making those estimates. For example, the ETR, as you\u2019ve seen, it could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and therefore could move the EPS around on a little bit with actually reflecting the underlying performance of the business. So, if you think that you should expect to see in the quarters in fiscal 2019, obviously Q3 will remain one of the probably the strongest quarter of the year, due to a seasonality, particularly on the Pharma side. On the Medical side, we should see improvement throughout the year. John and the team continue to improve the operations of Cordis, continue to transform the commercial approach, its commercial strategies for the overall Medical segment, but we should be seeing the benefits of those changes, ramping throughout the year. And that\u2019s probably what I could tell you at this point. Is that helpful? Steven Valiquette : Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. John Kreger : Hi. Thanks very much. Mike, just to go back to your discussion a minute ago about the sort of changing economics within the pharmaceutical distribution business. From your perspective, do you sort of have a model that you envision that would sort of work in an environment where the gross to net spread is getting materially smaller? Mike Kaufmann : I don\u2019t necessarily have a specific model at this point in time. I think, the importance is, is that we\u2019re very discipline. 12, 15 years ago, we went through the model change. We created what we call our next best alternative model, where we really look at each specific manufacturer to the value that we deliver for them. And as you know, each manufacture kind of has their own dynamics and mix and the adjustments they may make, the growth they may have and stuff differs. So, we\u2019re going to continue to work with each pharma manufacturer to see what\u2019s the right type of structure that may work for them and for us. We\u2019re going to be really focused on our value prop and then make sure we get paid for what we do. But, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s still a little too early to know exactly what might be the right model. But, we\u2019re having multiple discussions including keeping it similar to what it is, but higher rates the WACs are lower. So, we\u2019re -- that model could be a very simple change from that standpoint. So, we\u2019re looking at a continuum of different opportunities. John Kreger : Great, thanks. And then, I quick follow-up for Jorge. The guidance in fiscal 2019 for low single-digit revenue growth within the Medical segment, if you take out the acquisition benefit of patient recovery, what would you say the organic growth implied is on the top line? Jorge Gomez : Well, we haven\u2019t broken down the pieces of the revenue growth. But, I would tell you that within the Medical segment, there are a number of businesses that are growing organically well. You have at-Home, you have Cardinal Brand other than Patient Recovery. We have Cordis who -- which is also ramping -- continues to grow from a top line perspective. So, I think there\u2019s a number of -- most of the businesses within the Medical segment organically are showing increment from the top line perspective. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Eric Coldwell : Hey. Thanks very much and good morning. Jorge, at the end of the call, you made a comment on the New York State opioid assessment. I didn\u2019t catch that. I was hoping you could clarify what you\u2019re talking about. I do know the judge\u2019s decision there was considered a negative precedent, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m familiar with this assessment that you\u2019re talking to? Jorge Gomez : Yes, sure. Let me help you a little bit with that. So, in April, the state of New York created an aggregate $100 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors who sell or distribute opioids in New York. Based on that, a law -- the initial payment is due on January 1st of 2019 for opioids sold or distributed during calendar year 2017. And we haven\u2019t factored any impact from this newly passed law into our guidance because there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty around how it would be implemented. Some of the uncertainties that we see with this law include, there is a significant legal challenge pending against that law. There are a lot of complexities in the way the law was written, and is waiting some guidance from the state. And frankly, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in terms of how much each participant in that market will actually pay. Eric Coldwell : Okay. Thanks very much. That\u2019s helpful. Mike Kaufmann : Great. Well, thanks, everyone. Is there any more questions? Operator : There are no further questions over the telephone at this time, sir. Mike Kaufmann : Great. Well, I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. And we look forward to seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. Thanks and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Cardinal Health Inc. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Lynette. Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez. During the call we will provide details on our first quarter results, full year outlook and an update on our strategic initiatives. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the first quarter can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. In addition during the call we will provide an update to our FY 2019 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate. During the Q&A portion of our call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. As Lisa mentioned, I'll open up with some comments on our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and then provide a brief update on the six strategic initiatives we have underway to best position Cardinal Health for future growth. I'm proud of the hard work our team is doing, and we are on track as we execute on these initiatives. The first quarter provided us with a solid start to the year. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.29, up from the $1.09 we reported in the first quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% to $35 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were $542 million and operating cash flow was $365 million. Overall, operating performance came in about as expected. On the bottom line, we saw a large benefit from a lower tax rate. This was composed of the expected benefit from tax reform and roughly $0.18 of discrete benefits that Jorge will discuss in more detail. Based on our current assumptions, we are reaffirming our previous earnings guidance for the full year. Turning to the Pharma segment, let me share a few comments. On the top line, we are pleased with the revenue growth of nearly 9%. This increase was driven primarily by growth from existing customers. I believe that we are well aligned with customers who are growing, and this is being reflected in our increased volume. As it relates to segment earnings, the primary reason for the year-over-year decline is the previously communicated performance of our generic programs. Of note, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business which once again delivered outstanding results. Looking ahead, as we focus on driving the profitability and long-term growth of the Pharma segment, we are pleased to welcome Victor Crawford, who will join us as CEO of the Pharma segment beginning November 12. Victor is a proven leader with a strong track record at world-class companies, including Marriott, Pepsi, and most recently Aramark. He brings a wealth of knowledge and strong strategic relationships with many of our partners in the acute care space and serves on the advisory board of a larger acute care hospital. Victor knows what it takes to successfully manage a high-volume, low-margin distribution and services business and he inherits a very experienced team of leaders and a business that is well positioned with strong fundamentals. We look forward to benefiting from his experience and insight as he takes on his new role. Turning now to the Medical segment, overall, Medical delivered profit growth of 5% on revenue growth of 2%. Let me touch on a few highlights. Patient Recovery continues to perform well, and the integration of this business is on track. We are seeing solid progress on selling our expanded offering and leveraging the Patient Recovery team's category management skills across our portfolio. At Cordis, we continued to generate sales growth during this quarter, particularly in Asia, and we are making good progress in addressing the cost and inventory challenges we've experienced. Both our national brand distribution business and our services business continued to do very well, driven by solid demand for both. And finally, Cardinal Health at-Home delivered a strong first quarter, continuing its success in a growing market. Headwinds for the quarter were the expected impact of the China divestiture and reduced contribution from naviHealth, following our divestiture as a result of our partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. In addition, we experienced product cost increases in a few areas in our Cardinal Health brand which reduced margins. So all in all, while we still have work to do in the Medical segment, I am pleased that we are moving in the right direction. Importantly, we are growing in key areas of the business while taking steps to address other areas where we've had some challenges. No doubt, our expanded product breadth has provided us with new opportunities to enhance our value to customers and patients, and we are focused on taking advantage of this potential to drive long-term profitable growth. On our last call, we shared with you six strategic priorities that our team is laser focused on in fiscal 2019 : cost structure; Cordis; Patient Recovery; the Pharma model; our business portfolio; and capital deployment. We are making good progress in each of these areas. Let me touch on a few highlights and Jorge will provide further detail in the course of his financial review. In terms of cost, we are on track to deliver targeted annualized cost savings of $100 million in fiscal 2019 and in excess of $200 million by the end of fiscal year 2020, and we continue to take a hard look at how we can operate even more efficiently. At Cordis, our stabilization program is on track. The team has made meaningful progress, and we are seeing improvements in inventory management, demand planning, and cost. At the same time, the team is taking steps to optimize Cordis' product offering and global footprint to drive higher profitability. We remain confident that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of fiscal year 2019. With respect to Patient Recovery, we exited our TSAs with Medtronic for North America, Latin America, and the global supply chain in late July. In addition, we exited the TSAs for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions in late October. So far, while still early, things are going according to plan. We appreciate the hard work of our team in meeting these important milestones. We intend to exit the remaining TSAs in Asia-Pacific in early calendar 2019. At the same time, the team is keenly focused on continuing our momentum in the business of the business. As it relates to our Pharma model, we are continuing conversations with both our upstream manufacturer and downstream provider partners. We are discussing the industry dynamics that are impacting each of us in evaluating new models where appropriate. For example, we continue to push for differentiated pricing models with providers and less contingent margins with manufacturers. With respect to our portfolio, we have made some progress, including the exit of our China business early in the calendar year and our naviHealth partnership. We continue to actively assess the scope and mix of our businesses, consistent with our overall objective of focusing on where we can win and driving long-term profitable growth. And finally, regarding capital deployment, we are reinvesting in our business to drive future growth as well as returning cash to our shareholders. Jorge will discuss our balanced and disciplined approach in more detail. All in all, we are very pleased that we are making significant strides in all of our initiatives, and we look forward to building on this progress over the balance of fiscal year 2019. In closing, I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in getting fiscal year 2019 off to a good start. And as I said before, everything is on the table when it comes to delivering long-term growth, enhancing shareholder returns, and serving our customers and their patients. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency, and we are focused on achieving the goals we set in the months and the years ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Jorge to discuss our financials, provide additional detail on our strategic initiatives, and comment on our outlook for the balance of the year. Jorge? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us. This morning I will cover our Q1 results, elaborate on our full-year outlook, and share some detail on a few of the key initiatives that Mike mentioned. Starting with our first quarter results on slide 4, overall, these results were in line with our operating performance expectations apart from the tax rate, which was better than expected this quarter. I will discuss this shortly. Total company revenue increased 8% versus prior year to $35 billion. This increase was driven by growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Total company gross margin was essentially flat at about $1.7 billion. GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were $816 million, which includes a pre-tax book gain on the sale of naviHealth of $508 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $542 million. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.29, an 18% increase from the prior year. Our Q1 effective tax rate of 14% was lower than expected due to favorable discrete items of approximately $0.18. This is included in our Q1 EPS of $1.29. These discrete items include primarily the continuing work to alleviate the tax rate pressure created by Cordis financial performance in certain jurisdictions. We completed the majority of this work in Q1, as we anticipated and shared with you last quarter. For Q1, SG&A increased 6%, primarily due to opioid-related expenses and a one-time stamp duty incurred in Switzerland related to international legal entity changes for Cordis. These changes were a key driver for the more favorable tax rate in Q1. I will discuss the opioid-related expenses when I cover the Pharma segment results. Shifting to our cost optimization initiative that we introduced last quarter, we are making strong progress and seeing results. Our initial labor savings and policy changes took effect in late August and early September, and we achieved the savings milestones we set for Q1. The benefits from this and additional actions will continue to ramp up throughout the year. I'd like to be clear. This is not a traditional cost reduction exercise. We are looking at our enterprise with fresh eyes. We are taking a holistic approach to create a sustainable operating structure, supported by meticulous cost management. As Mike has said, everything is on the table. I will cover more about this work to drive long-term growth when I revisit our full-year assumptions. Returning to our overall results for the quarter, interest and other expense were about $80 million, a slight decrease versus the prior year, driven by a lower debt balance. Q1 average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 306 million, about 12 million fewer shares than Q1 of last year. Recently we completed a $600 million share repurchase program. We included both the amount and the timing of this program in our fiscal 2019 assumptions. Yesterday, our board approved a $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. We now have $1.3 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization. Separately, our board approved our quarterly dividend, which will be payable to shareholders on January 15, 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to thoughtful capital deployment, which includes delivering a strong cash flow yield to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Our continued focus on cash flow generation and diligent working capital management resulted in Q1 operating cash flow of $365 million. We ended Q1 with a strong cash balance of $2 billion, even after funding a large share repurchase program, dividends, and capital expenditures. This cash balance includes approximately $600 million held outside the U.S. Now I'll turn to segment results, starting on slide 5. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 9% to $31.4 billion, driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical distribution and Specialty customers. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our China distribution business. Segment profit for Q1 was $409 million versus $467 million in the prior year. As anticipated, this decrease was driven by the negative impact from our generic programs, contract renewals, and the divestiture of the China distribution business. Partially offsetting these headwinds were strong results from our Specialty Solutions business. As Mike said, we are very pleased with the performance of Specialty. It continues to be a contributor to growth through higher volume and better mix. Let me elaborate on the opioid-related expenses I mentioned earlier that are included in our Pharma SG&A for the first quarter and full year. First, as you may remember, last quarter I mentioned the potential impact of the New York Opioid Stewardship Act, which created an aggregate annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors who sell or distribute certain controlled substances in New York State. This assessment is retroactive to calendar year 2017. We recently received a preliminary invoice for calendar 2017. Based on this estimate, we accrued $34 million for amounts owed through Q1 of fiscal 2019. Of this number, $29 million is excluded from non-GAAP results because it relates to the catch-up accrual for sales in periods prior to fiscal 2019, and the remaining $5 million relates to our first quarter this year. Our Pharma segment profit outlook for the year now reflects our current view of this assessment's impact going forward. This matter is complex and there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the State of New York has indicated that the preliminary invoice amounts for calendar 2017 may change significantly. Second, this newly adopted law is currently being challenged in court. As we monitor both of these factors, we're actively exploring a number of mitigation plans. Also included in our opioid-related expenses are the costs associated with litigation in multiple legal cases where Cardinal Health is a party with our distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and retail pharmacy chains. These legal costs have exceeded our initial expectations and are included in our Pharma segment results as well as in our fiscal 2019 outlook. Excluding the $29 million accrued for prior periods, we expect our total expenses in fiscal 2019 for both the New York assessment and the ongoing litigation to be about $80 million. We will continue to share more information as it becomes available. Continuing with the Medical segment on slide 6, segment revenue grew 2% to $3.8 billion. This top line growth was driven primarily by contributions from new and existing customers. We saw strong growth in national brand distribution, Cardinal Health at-Home, and services. First quarter segment profit increased 5% to $135 million. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2018, our results included an inventory step-up charge of $42 million for Patient Recovery. This quarter, the non-repeat of that charge was mostly offset by increased costs related to Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, excluding the effect of the step-up, did not meaningfully impact segment profit in the quarter. As a reminder, after the close of our partnership, our share of naviHealth is reflected in other income and expense rather than in the Medical segment. Regarding Patient Recovery, as Mike shared, we are pleased with the performance of the business and the progress on the integration. In late July we exited the TSAs for North America, Latin America, and global supply chain, which account for the majority of the overall business. We successfully worked through a few of the typical bumps seen in large integrations. Additionally, while still early, we are pleased with the progress on the second wave of TSA exits completed in October, which include geographies in EMEA. Overall, the Patient Recovery business is performing as expected. We're on track to achieve the accretion goal we shared previously. For Cordis, we saw top line growth in Q1, particularly in Asia-Pacific, and we continue to see the commercial health of this business improve. We mentioned last quarter that our team is executing a multi-faceted strategy to stabilize this business. This includes category optimization and geography rationalization. We successfully transitioned manufacturing lines and exited 14 countries based on profit profiles. This work will allow us to focus on the major and growing markets for this business. We are seeing positive metric trends, including improved fill rates, increased service levels, and lower back order rates. Overall, we have greatly increased our demand planning capabilities and inventory visibility and this business continues to stabilize. Next, I'd like to direct you to our full-year assumptions on slides 8 and 9. We are on track to finish fiscal 2019 as we indicated in August. With only one quarter completed, at this time we have no changes to our corporate or segment assumptions for the year. Current industry and business dynamics for the rest of the year will continue to evolve. We are weighing the potential impact of several factors such as brand inflation as well as the generic deflation trends. In addition, we are looking at other factors, including the final true up of our provisional tax estimates under tax reform, the value capture of our cost and structural initiatives, and the net impact of changes within the businesses of a few of our Pharma customers. We expect our second quarter to reflect many of these elements. We continue to see good top line growth for the Pharma segment and strong performance at the top and bottom line for the Specialty Solutions business. This has been offset by some headwinds I discussed earlier as well as the renewal of Optum. Our second quarter and full-year results would also reflect the year-over-year impact of these positions. Given all the considerations above, we expect Q2 operating earnings performance for the company to be somewhat in line with the performance in our first quarter. We will meet and likely exceed both of the savings estimates we shared with you in August. We are realizing near-term improvement that will drive us toward and beyond the $100 million of annualized savings for fiscal 2019 and likely increase the aggregate $200 million in savings by fiscal 2020. In parallel, with this savings capture, we're implementing strategies that will empower all of our employees to practice sustainable diligent cost management well into the future. At the same time, we are actively evaluating strategies to leverage new ideas, tools, and technologies to simplify our internal operations and drive efficiencies across the enterprise. This includes opportunities to optimize resources, infrastructure, and geographies. We are developing large-scale roadmaps for this work, and we are rapidly entering the execution phase for certain work streams. We will share more progress as this work continues. These approaches will allow us to substantially improve our cost structure and efficiently modernize our internal operating model to fuel profitable growth as we adapt to a rapidly changing industry. In light of all of these initiatives and factors I just discussed, we are not changing our full year guidance at this time. In closing, we are pleased that the performance in Q1 align with our expectations. We're also pleased with the momentum we have gained regarding the numerous initiatives in flight that are squarely addressing the key opportunities and challenges on our horizon. We are laser focused on creating sustainable growth and delivering value for our shareholders, customers, and partners. With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear first from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Mike, I guess we don't spend a lot of time typically talking about revenue, but the top line in the Pharma segment grew significantly and was obviously well above what we were anticipating in the quarter. And yet, as you guys mentioned, it didn't really have the same incremental or commensurate impact on the operating profit for the segment. So I was hoping maybe you could just go back and spend a little time helping us better understand the dynamic at play there, just what was driving what seems to be well above average top line growth and maybe not seeing the flow-through on the operating profit side within the Pharma segment. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. It was strong revenue growth in the quarter. As I mentioned, it was really because we're aligned with I think some very strong growing customers. So it really wasn't materially new business. It was really coming from existing customers who had strong revenue growth in the first quarter. And as Jorge said, it was several things. It's just a little bit too early for us to be looking at these as trends because we know there are some upcoming headwinds with some things we're lapping, as we built into our plan. So at this point in time, we're pleased with the first quarter, but again, a little bit too early for us to call it out as a trend, but we'll continue to evaluate that. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then I guess, Mike, just to follow up there, embedded in that was just why not the commensurate impact on operating profit. Obviously, you're aligning yourselves with these customers that are driving significant or above-average top-line growth, but yet you're not really necessarily seeing that carry through to the profit side. Any further explanation just on that dynamic? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think we obviously did see some drop-through from it. It's coming from larger customers that are going to be lower margin rate customers, so that's one thing to keep in mind. A lot of it's going to be on lower margin branded business because it's higher dollars, and so that doesn't have as high a margin rate. And as Jorge said, there are some other puts and the takes in the quarter such as extra opioid spend and a few other things that are all netting out. So we did see some drop-through, but there are several different puts and in the quarter. Thanks for the question. Operator : We'll move next to Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Hey, I just wanted to get a couple clarifications. Jorge, in regards to the tax rate, you talked about legal entity changes. Can you clarify? What does that mean? Are we consolidating the global footprint for Cordis and rationalizing that? And then you also talked about the increased cost rate of the Cardinal Health brand, including Cordis. Is that related to commodities? If you can just give us some more details around that, that would be great. Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Sure. On the first question about tax and Cordis, if you recall, back in Q3 our tax rate was \u2013 Q3 of last year our tax rate was very high as a result of some issues that we experienced with international legal entities for Cordis and how the profitability was looking at that time. We took pretty decisive action at that point and we began a process to restructure the legal entities that basically are the basis for the business of Cordis outside the U.S. We began the first set of execution of steps in Q4. And as you may recall, we had actually a very favorable tax rate in Q4 of last year, and that was the result of the first steps that were executed. At that point, I also indicated that we had not finalized that project; that we would finalize it in Q1, which in fact we did. And as we completed the final steps in that restructuring, we also experienced some further discrete items that benefited the rate in Q1. So that process related to restructuring those legal entities is now finalized, and we basically went back to the place we wanted to be of the structure of legal entities outside the U.S. So that's what happened there. With respect to Cardinal brand cost, there are a few things going on. And as you probably have heard from others, there's some substantial increases in market cost of commodities and other supplies in that business. So that has created some cost pressure. We also had in the quarter some elevated costs related to TSA-related expenses, the assets from TSAs with Medtronic, those supply chain costs, and FX was a slight headwind in the quarter net-net for the Medical segment as well. And then finally, I'd say as it relates to cost within Cordis, we have talked about this a couple of times, but in manufacturing we have some headwinds, primarily manufacturing outsourcing costs. As we have indicated before, we have a very good plan to bring inventory balances for Cordis down to the levels that we think are sustainable and reasonable for this business. And as a result of that, production levels have come down, have slowed down, and that creates an accounting impact related to absorption that is reflected as a headwind from a cost perspective in that business. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC: If I can follow up, is that to continue through the rest of the year when we think about modeling out Cordis? Because you talked about greater than expected savings, and obviously you had better tax this quarter but were reaffirming guidance. Should we think about then the difference would be more just a flow-through on the Cordis side here through the rest of the year? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think we're thinking about this cost pressure not only related to Cordis but commodities and other parts of our cost basis within Medical. That will continue over the next few quarters. There are issues around nitro prices and other commodity prices. We're doing a lot of things to manage that exposure. We hedge where we can. We're managing inventory levels. We are trying to use pricing as possible to offset some of those pressures, but we expect that it will continue over several quarters. But again, all of those cost pressures are captured within our assessment of our guidance for this year. So all of that is contemplated and it will be a headwind, but it's included in our guidance. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : We'll move next to Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Jorge, one question of clarification. When you talked about next quarter, were you referring to EPS enterprise operating profits or a specific segment? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: My comments about Q2 was enterprise-level first, and I said that we expect the performance in this quarter, in Q2, to be in line with Q1 from an operating earnings perspective. That was my comment. From an EPS perspective, there's the tax rate. It's something that, as we have indicated before, it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. But overall for the year, we still think that the tax rate is going to be very close to \u2013 within the range that we talked about before. But operating performance in Q2 we believe sequentially is going to be very similar. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And should we think about it in an absolute dollar value; i.e., the operating earning number that you reported in the quarter, or is it growth rates? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Correct. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No problem. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then, Mike, you talked about a potential new payment model, as did your peers on their calls. How should we think about the potential transition to a model where rates are determined product by product or by product class? Should we think about this type of changes happen upon contract renewal, or is this something that's going to happen all at once? If you can give us some color there and your thoughts about the time it's going to take to make that transition. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, so since I'm not 100% sure whether you're referring to upstream or downstream, I'll just address both to be helpful. Downstream-wise, as we've said in the past, we continue to evaluate our pricing models to make sure that we are looking at the various product classes and pricing them appropriately. So basically, while we will always continue to bundle price to some degree on the Pharma side, we're trying to break that bundle down as appropriate to drive the right behaviors and protect us from margin erosion and make sure that contracts going forward are both we're getting paid appropriately and mix changes don't impact us as much going forward. And so we're working and continuing to do that. I know you've heard us and many others talk about things like Specialty and those. We're continuing to just refine that pricing model downstream. Second thing is, if you go upstream, it would depend on the manufacturer. I'm very comfortable with the current model priced on black, like it is with the DSAs as long as we're being paid appropriately and the dynamics work as they're supposed to. The area where we're most likely to change our pricing models upstream is in the contingent margin agreements with manufacturers. If the manufacturers are going to have lower price increases or different price increases than expected per what we calculated to be our fair payment, then we're going to have to adjust those models. And we're constantly having conversations with those manufacturers to make sure not only this year we'll be paid appropriately, but going forward that those deals reflect a proper value of what we provide to them. Thank you, next question. Operator : We'll hear next from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning, Mike and Jorge. So just another question on the commodity costs on the Medical business. I guess in your 10-K, you guys help us out as you give the math on the hypothetical 10% inflation on your $425 million direct exposure. And just back of the envelope calculation, it seems like that would be about maybe a $0.10 EPS impact. But I guess I'm curious to hear more color on what you're seeing on the actual inflation trends in the real world right now on this key basket of inputs so far in this fiscal year, whether that's trending below 10%, above 10%. Just any color on that might help. It's hard for us to know all the inputs in that particular component. Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Hi, Steve. Thanks for your question. Yeah, it's hard to give an overall inflation rate for the entire basket of commodities because of timing issues and all the actions that we take, and so it's hard to give an overall number. But I would say that the inflation pressures on those items are high, and we are working really, really hard to minimize the impact, but it's something that in the last several months has increased substantially. But as I said before, based on our projections, when we look at each of the products and the projections for the rest of the year, we believe that based on the forward curves that we see of inflation for those products, we can certainly manage that within the guidance for this year. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The only real quick follow-up, just if you have a one-liner on, you sort of changed talking about the direct and indirect impact. Now you just talk about the direct impact in that 10-K discussion. Just any quick color around the thought pattern on the change there? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah so clearly, we are exposed to both direct inflation on the products that we buy to make our products, but we also have the exposure related to finished products that we buy. So the best example is exam gloves, which has experienced a lot of inflation in the last several quarters, first due to supply disruptions, and now it's more about the actual cost of the raw materials. So we track both. Obviously, the direct exposure is easier to hedge and to manage. The indirect exposure we try to handle through contract negotiations, inventory levels, and other operational actions. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question? Operator : We'll move next to Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : Good morning, guys. Could we talk a little bit about the underlying Medical trend? Because if I adjust for the $42 million from the prior year, the implied on the base is obviously pretty negative. And I know we've talked about Cordis and some of the input costs, but I'm just trying to understand more the magnitude of how we're going to get from what looks like down double digits underlying right now back to growth, and what are the biggest buckets of that driver. I know you called a few things out, but I'm just trying to understand magnitudinally what the biggest push is on that to get particularly to the back half numbers given what you said already about Q2. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I'll let Jorge go through the details. I just want to say, though, remind everybody, we are very excited about the way Patient Recovery is going so far off of the TSAs, and we are seeing very good performance there and making some good progress. But there are some puts and takes that I think would be helpful that Jorge will give you a little more color. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, Ross, the first thing I would say is, so we have been very transparent about the performance of the Medical segment. And excluding Patient Recovery, the step up, we are down in the quarter for the Medical segment. Mechanically, if you remember, first you need to deduct naviHealth and China. So those are two elements that deduct from the growth in the quarter. Then we have several businesses within Medical that are actually performing really well. I mentioned at-Home services. Those are businesses that are growing. And so, as you think about the rest of the year and the ramp, we believe and we are forecasting those businesses to help out the next several quarters from a growth perspective. When we go down to Cordis, Cordis from its top line perspective has grown for the last few quarters, and we are expecting and we're seeing that all the actions that we are taking in that business will contribute over time, over the next several quarters, to ramp the earnings of the Medical business. Patient Recovery, Mike mentioned this before. It's performing as expected, progressing well the integration. And as I said before, we feel very comfortable with respect to meeting the accretion goals that we talked about in the past. We have the challenges from a cost perspective. And I mentioned commodity, I mentioned supply chain costs. Net-net, including all of the puts and takes, we are comfortable with the trajectory of the Medical segment this year, and we think it will continue to ramp to deliver the numbers that we indicated in our guidance, the growth rate that we presented for the Medical segment. We feel good about that despite the cost challenges that we saw in Q1. Ross Muken - Evercore ISI : And just to follow up, relative to your comment on Q2 being flat on an operating earnings basis, if I look back historically at Cardinal, that wouldn't be an unusual outcome in prior years, flat to probably up modestly, and Q2 was fairly typical. But last year, partially given the full onboarding of Patient Recovery and maybe a little bit less of the inventory, you had a much bigger sequential step-up. And so the Street was looking for that this year. I guess if I think about that flat guide for Q2 or color, am I to think that most of that comment or the delta is probably on the Medical side, or is it also contemplating the pricing reset from United, which seems to be happening next quarter? I'm just trying to get magnitude where the Street in your mind was probably most off. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: What I can tell you, Ross, is sequentially, if I look at the magnitude of the earnings and the puts and takes from what is seasonal and what is not seasonal from Q4 to Q1 to Q2, we are not seeing anything that I would call out as special that could yield a result that was not based on our expectations, so we see a trend from Q1 to Q2. When I look at all the puts and takes from quarter to quarter, I don't see anything that is unusual from an operating earnings perspective. It is in line with our expectations, with the trends, with the progression that we are seeing for each of the businesses, including obviously the headwinds that we indicated we would have this year, including the headwinds related to generic deflation, customer contract renewals, those types of things. So all things considered, everything we shared with you guys and what we see in terms of drivers of the business, there is nothing unusual there from Q1 to Q2 that we would highlight. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : We'll hear next from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, thanks for the question. I apologize for this. Maybe it's a fuzzy line, maybe whatever it is. I just want to make sure it's clear as possible. There are a bunch of questions that have been coming into me. Q1 to Q2, this is dollars that are similar, not growth rate on EBIT, enterprise EBIT? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Correct. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. If that's the case, when you think into the back half of the year, I know you reiterated guidance. In terms of that delta, what is the biggest thing in your mind, either across Medical, across Pharma, or across corporate that really gets better, especially because I know there are some concerns as we start the \u2013 into fiscal 2019 that there might be lower branded price inflation than we've seen given all the political rhetoric that's going on. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I'll mention a few things and then, Jorge, if I miss anything. First of all, remember, our Q3 is always seasonally high. And at this point in time, we are still expecting the amount of branded inflation that we essentially originally forecasted or budgeted for the year in Q3. And we have had a lot of conversations with the manufacturers that are contingent and still continuing to believe that that is the right assumption. We've said that if we're off by a couple percentage points, that could be absorbed within our guidance range. But at this point in time, we are still assuming that based on conversations that we're having and compared to what we plan to have. So remember that Q3 tends to be bigger. The second thing is that we are ramping up our cost initiatives. And so those grow and create benefits for us over the rest of the year. And then we have some other initiatives that we continue to work on. And I don't know, Jorge, if you would add anything else to that. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No, I think, Mike, you covered all the key points there. Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you so much. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No problem. Operator : We'll hear next from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks. Can you detail a little bit more on where you were at in the progress of your cost structure initiatives? What are those next steps maybe that help us reconcile with that quarterly progression a little bit more in terms of how that or when that will materialize more meaningfully here? And given you mentioned that could exceed your initial expectations, are those higher expectations embedded in your 2019 assumptions? Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks, Erin. So we indicated that we are targeting to achieve this year annualized cost savings of about $100 million. Those savings actually began to accrue in Q1. We implemented some labor initiatives as well as some spending policy initiatives as a first step, and those are in flight. They were implemented. And in Q1, whatever we had in budget we actually exceeded in Q1. Those initiatives will continue to ramp throughout the year, and there are other initiatives related to operating model and other zero-based redesign operating model in each that are kicking in, in Q2 and Q3. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I feel very comfortable about achieving the target that we set for fiscal 2019. I believe we will be actually overachieving that saving, and it will continue to ramp. When we exit fiscal 2019, we should be on or above $100 million in annualized cost reductions for the enterprise. As Mike indicated, everything is on the table. We're working on labor policy, zero-based redesign, all of those things, and we feel good about it. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. And then on capital deployment, how should we be thinking about the timing and magnitude of the debt paydown as well as share buyback with the new authorization announced today? Are you active on the buyback quarter to date? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: The first thing I would say is we just completed a $600 million share repurchase program. We paid out a dividend of close to $150 million. So our commitment to returning cash to shareholders I think is very clear. We will continue to balance our capital deployment following the same principles that we have followed in the past. We want to reinvest in the business when it makes sense. We'll continue to pay our dividend. We'll continue to do share repurchases depending on valuation and depending on excess cash. We are not going to sit on idle cash, and we want to keep up all of those options available to us, always with the intention of having a very prudent reasonable capital structure, financial flexibility, and returning cash to our shareholders. I don't think you should expect to see any changes, any significant changes from what we have been doing for the last several quarters and years. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question. Operator : David Larsen from Leerink, your line is open. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for costs related to opioids? I think you mentioned maybe $100 million or so for the year is what's expected. How much of that is actually included in your adjusted operating results? How much of that is related to the State of New York? And if it spreads to other states, what sort of exposure are you thinking about? Thanks. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the question. I'll start and then turn it over to Jorge. First of all, I just want to step back from this whole thing and tell you that Cardinal just cares deeply about this whole opioid abuse issue and the impact it's having on families and communities. We understand it's a complex and multi-faceted problem. Many parties are involved, and we're working with all of them to help find solutions. We want to be part of the solution. We're sure, as complicated as it is, we're going to continue to focus on that. We do want to continue to always remind folks that we're not the ones that control the supply or demand for opioids. We don't promote. We don't manufacture and we don't prescribe. So I think just stepping back for a minute, that's really important. Specifically to the costs that we're incurring and expect to incur this year between the opioid and litigation spend, let me have Jorge give you a little bit of detail on that. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, Mike. So just to clarify, the number that I mentioned in my prepared remarks was about $80 million of expenses related to both opioid litigation or opioid legal fees as well as the New York assessment that we are contemplating for the next few quarters. Within that number, I would tell you the majority of that number is related to legal fees. David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then if it expands to other states, is that included in this $80 million estimate? And based on what you know now with your discussions with your attorneys, is that a possibility or not? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: It is too early to make any comments on that. Operator : We'll move next to John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead. Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Courtney Owens for John Kreger, but our questions were answered, so I'll just hop out of the queue. Thanks, guys. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : We'll move next to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, good morning. Mike, I just want to go back to your comment earlier in your prepared remarks. So you said everything is on the table. You clearly talked about what's happening on the medical supply component of your business and continued challenges there. You've talked about some of the other elements of your business. What do you mean exactly by that comment, number one? And number two, what's the review process that you're going through today to look at what businesses make sense for Cardinal on an ongoing basis? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. I would say it comes from a couple different angles. First of all, from an expense standpoint, we're saying everything is on the table. And as it relates to there, just because we've been doing something this way in the past doesn't mean we're going to continue doing it. We're looking very aggressively at things such as putting robotic automation in place to be more efficient, looking at blockchain, other things like that. So we are looking at all types of automation and activities, streamlining, spans, and layers to get aggressively after our cost structure. We're also looking aggressively at the way we contract both upstream and downstream. And just because again we've been doing something one way in the past, we're looking hard at that. And that's not just what we typically talk about, which is the Pharma segment, but very much so also in the Medical segment. We are very much looking at the fact that we need to do category management in a much more disciplined and aggressive way than we ever have, because we believe that it's actually not only just better for us, but much better for our customers, because when we carry fewer SKUs and can drive higher service levels and better costing, it allows us to operate more efficiently in our distribution centers. It allows us to be a better partner with the manufacturers that we partner with. And most importantly, we can provide better service levels and better costing to our downstream customers in Medical. And that is something that we need to be aggressive at and look at. It's not something you can change overnight, but it is something that is clearly on the table. And then I would say in the third bucket is around the businesses. We are putting a lens on every business that we have. We are being dispassionate about how long we've had it, why we've had it, where it's at. Can we win, are we best positioned to be a winner with that business, and what are the growth prospects of that business? And we are doing, as you can imagine, a very detailed analysis on each one of our businesses. And we look at them, and when appropriate, we will work through the appropriate either exits, partnerships, or growth if we think it's an area for us, then we want to double down. And so we are being very fact based and not emotional or stuck to anything that we do. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And just as my follow-up, Jorge, I think that we continue to get the question, I know you answered this several times as we think about first quarter to second quarter. It is EBIT that you expect to be flat first quarter to second quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: That is correct. Yes, Lisa. Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: No problem. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator? Operator : George Hill from RBC, please go ahead. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, Jorge. I'm going to get on the guidance merry-go-round one more time. And I guess as I look at the guidance for the Pharmaceutical segment, you're talking about low single-digit revenue growth and high to low single-digit EBIT growth decline for the year. Q1 put up, as Bob noted earlier, very strong revenue growth. I don't see a reason why that would shift in Q2. It looks like something flips in the mix significantly in the back half of the year because the implication would be revenue growth slows down pretty dramatically while margins would have to somehow improve given the guidance. I guess is there any more color that you can give us around the moving pieces in the drug segment as it relates to the EBIT and the guide? And I have a quick follow-up, if we have time. Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yeah, I'm going to repeat something that Mike said with respect to revenue, so let me start with revenue. Clearly, we had a very strong Q1 with a growth of 9%. At this point, we don't want to extrapolate from that number. Our largest customers are growing really fast. They had a good quarter. That benefited us. Mike talked about that. When I look at the progression of the quarters, we expect the top line to have a healthy growth, in line with what we indicated in our guidance. And within the businesses, we have Specialty great Q1, and we're seeing good performance for the rest of the year. And the other pieces, we talk about that. You'd have branded inflation. Q3 is the key quarter for us. At this point, we don't have any reason to believe that that number that we have in the budget for Q3 is going to be different. I think we feel good about that. And then generic deflation will continue to be a headwind for the rest of the year, as we indicated in our guidance, and that's what we're seeing today. So there is no \u2013 in totality for the Pharma segment as well as, yeah for the Pharma segment in totality, what we are projecting now is in line with what we had initially contemplated for that segment. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: One thing I'll add that just might be a little bit helpful is remember, some of our larger customers also they still warehouse and buy the products from us. So it's hard to over one quarter when they can be adjusting their inventory levels up or down to all of a sudden determine that's a trend for a whole year. And so as I said, we're comfortable that we're aligned with strong growing customers. Remember that sometimes just on the days of the week or the timing of some of their decisions around inventory, it can cause revenue to fluctuate a little bit, and we just want to be prudent to let some more time pass and feel that it's a little bit early. George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, that's helpful. And I guess if we look at the brand side of the business, we've seen the authorized launch of a generic \u2013 or we're about to see the authorized launch of a generic drug in hep C, and we've seen Amgen take a steep price cut on a cholesterol drug. As you guys think about the changes to the branded side of the business, do you think your unit economics can stay the same or your unit profit can stay flat in an environment where manufacturers are taking price of their own accord or (61:16)? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. We're having very active conversations with manufacturers. Whether it is launching an authorized generic but that acts actually more like a brand that we are looking at the unit rates that we are making and adjusting the percentage fees appropriately with those so that we don't lose net dollars. And we are having very positive and proactive conversations with manufacturers related to this because the value of what we do does not change as they make these large price decreases, and that we still need to get paid for the services that we provide. So we're having very appropriate, proactive, and I think good conversations with manufacturers around those types of items. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, next question? Operator? Operator : Eric Percher, please go ahead. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : Thank you. Maybe back to the conversation around everything being on the table, we learned this quarter that you're exiting the Specialty Pharmacy business. Could you speak to what was behind that and the commitment to Specialty distribution? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Absolutely, thanks for the question on that. I guess first and foremost, we're incredibly committed to Specialty. We've said that we had another really great quarter with Specialty. The business continues to perform very well, and it remains one of our key growth drivers. We've done exceptional job of growing the business, consistently double digits, both upstream and downstream to providers and manufacturers. I do want to emphasize, though, we still possess specialty pharmacy capabilities. We still have a full service specialty pharmacy that complements our Metro Medical dialysis products business, and we also have a non-commercial specialty pharmacy that is part of our Sonexus hub services business. This was just an individual specialty pharmacy that we got through an acquisition in the past that represented a very, very small portion of our Specialty Solutions business, and that we just didn't feel that we were in the best position to grow that particular piece of business. It was incredibly small, and to continue to grow it to reach competitive scale just didn't make sense for us. So it's very consistent in how we've talked about evaluating our portfolio around simplifying, playing where we can win, and being dispassionate about those types of things. But I want to stress that we are deeply committed to specialty, invested in several areas in specialty in this area, and continue to have scale in all the tools we need where we need to be and want to be in specialty. Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC : So I should take from that that in supporting your current customer base, you feel like you have those capabilities, but you're no longer looking to create a significant specialty pharmacy presence for its own purpose. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: I think if I understand that right, that would be right. Everything that our current customers need, whether it's a provider or really manufacturer, we can service them. But having just a separate standalone specialty pharmacy and competing in that environment with these dynamics just didn't \u2013 it was again, incredibly small, very minor to our earnings that it just didn't make sense to continue to hold on to that. And we believe that we sold it to someone else that can do very well with that and add to the scale they already had. Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Operator, I think we have time one more question. Operator : Your last question will come from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, I get the scraps today. Thanks, guys, for letting me in, just a couple of quick technical ones. First off, on the New York stewardship, the opioid situation, have you changed how manufacturers ship to you, or are you considering doing so such that they pay the fees and not you? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: As you can imagine, we are looking at that. We have communicated to manufacturers that there will be some changes in the way we would expect to operate going forward. We plan to work with them and with our provider customers. But we will and have \u2013 we will be making changes and have had discussions and communicated with manufacturers around that. Specifically what the details are, I'm not comfortable going into those exact details. But as you can imagine, we would expect to mitigate the cost of that assessment going forward. Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Now the $80 million of opioid cost in non-GAAP guidance, how much of that is incremental from the original guidance this year? Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Over half of that is incremental to our original guidance this year. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kaufmann for any additional or closing comments. Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.: Thank you very much. I just want to end with thanking all of you for your questions. And most importantly I want to wish you all some enjoyable time with family and friends over the holidays. Take care, and I'm sure we'll be seeing many of you. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead. Lisa Capodici : Thank you, Bryce. Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez. During the call we will provide details on our second quarter results, full year outlook and an update on our strategic initiatives. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. In addition during the call we will provide an update to our fiscal 2019 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions. And with that I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Let me begin with some comments on our second quarter of fiscal 2019 and then I'll provide a brief update on the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives to drive future growth. With the first half under our belt, I'm very pleased that we're on track with executing our plan. Overall the second quarter came in ahead of our expectations led by the pharma segment. EPS for the quarter was $1.29 and revenue up $37.7 billion was up 7%. Operating earnings were $637 million and operating cash flow was $372 million. Based on the year-to-date performance we're raising our guidance range for non-GAAP EPS for the full year to $4.97 to $5.17 from our previous range of $4.90 to $5.15. Jorge will walk you through the details and our current assumption. Our confidence in raising our guidance for fiscal 2019 is based on the tangible results we're beginning to see from the hard work being performed across the enterprise, as we execute on our top priorities. Turning now to the pharma segment, a few comments. Overall this business continues to be powered by our partnerships with strong growing customers and the critical role we play in supporting their mission day in and day out. Serving more than 26,000 pharmacies on a daily basis and 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics we're integral to their businesses and to their success meeting patients' needs. Further I'm proud that our team continues to develop innovative new ways to enhance the value we provide the customers. After performance revenue for the segment was up 8% to $33.7 billion. As anticipated our generics program remain the most significant profit headwind and overall generic market dynamics remain consistent with prior quarter. On the positive side, we benefited from improvement in brand volume. Within this environment, driving down our cost and increasing efficiency remains critical and during the quarter, we saw positive impact from the cost reduction initiatives we have underway. An additional highlight was our specialty business which continued its strong momentum during the quarter outperforming our expectations. Specialty once again delivered excellent revenue and profit growth driven by higher volumes as well as mix. In the medical segment, revenue for the quarter up $4 billion was about flat a year ago reflecting the China and naviHealth divestiture. Importantly, we're making good progress on the major strategic initiatives we have underway to drive better results and longer term growth. Patient Recovery continues to achieve integration milestones including most recently exiting our last major TSA in Asia Pacific in late January. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the longer term growth potential of this business. At Cordis, our stabilization program is also on track and the steps we've taken are beginning to have impact. Service levels and fill rates are up, while back orders and inventory expenses are moving down. The team continues to optimize the product mix and streamline our geographic footprint. We remain confident that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of the fiscal year. Finally, our services business and Cardinal Health at home will once again standout this quarter reflecting ongoing strong demand from both. Services continues to expand it niche providing value added technology and logistic support to our partners, while the at-Home business is capitalizing on a number of larger healthcare trend. All in all the medical segment team is executing and making solid progress. Further, as we look ahead, given our expanded offering of medical products and services coupled with our strong distribution network. We see opportunities to drive long-term growth especially in Cardinal Health brand products. Let me now turn briefly to our strategic priorities. Beyond my earlier comments on Patient Recovery and Cordis, overall we're making good progress and remain laser focused on how we can deliver the greatest value. With respect to our cost structure as you know back in August, we announced a significant cost savings program. And as Jorge will discuss we're well positioned to exceed both our near term target of $100 million in annualized savings for fiscal year 2019 and our longer term goal of at least $200 million. In addition the team continues to actively review how we operate and seek further opportunities to reduce cost. We have a significant number of work streams and flight looking at both what we do and how we do it. As it relates to our pharma model, we continue to actively discuss evolving industry dynamics and evaluate new models with both our upstream manufacturer and downstream provider partners. This includes continuing to push with differentiated pricing models with providers and less contingent margins with manufacturers. And finally, regarding capital deployment Jorge will provide a few update. I would just note, that we continue to execute a very disciplined and thoughtful strategy to fund the future growth of the business, return cash to shareholders and maintain our healthy balance sheet. Supporting all of this work, of course are our people. And I'm thrilled that we continue to strengthen and enhance our leadership team. Since our last call, Victor Crawford joined us CEO of the Pharma segment and he has brought highly relevant skills and insights as we navigate our evolving industry landscape. In addition, just this week Brian Rice joined as our Chief Information Officer to lead our global technology and customer service teams. Brian brings deep experience leading global IT and business services and we look forward to benefiting from his expertise and perspective. In summary, while we still have a lot of work to do there is much to be excited about. As I look back over the past year, we've made significant progress improving execution, sharpening our portfolio, getting after cost and strengthening our leadership team. Going forward our core distribution businesses will continue to be essential to the healthcare system. We will continue to adjust our pharma distribution business to improve profitability and leverage our medical distribution business with our significant portfolio of Cardinal Health products. At the same time, we will invest in our current growth platforms such as specialty, at-Home and our services businesses. Let me wrap up by extending my thanks and appreciation to our entire team for their hard work this past quarter and for their dedication and continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. We look forward to building on this solid foundation over the balance of the year. With the ultimate objective of delivering the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Jorge. Jorge Gomez : Thanks Mike and thank you all for joining us this morning. We're pleased with the second quarter performance. We're seeing progress in many areas as some of our strategic priorities begin to translate into results. Today, I'll focus on three areas our Q2 results, our full year outlook and updates on a few of our strategic priorities. Overall performance in Q2 was better than anticipated due to a few factors. Several businesses exceeded our expectations, we saw volume favorability in the pharmaceutical segments, better than anticipated expense trends and a favorable ruling regarding the New York State opioid assessment. Off note, there was also some positive impact from a timing perspective with corporate expenses and other areas. Total company revenue increased to $37.7 billion up 7% versus prior year. Total company gross margin was down 7% from last year to about $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $637 million. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 28.5% a 2.3 percentage point increase was prior year driven by tax reform and discrete tax items. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.29, a 15% decrease versus last year. During Q2, we saw a 3% improvement in SG&A due to a divestiture of China distribution and naviHealth businesses as well as the early benefit from our ongoing cost optimization efforts which I'll discuss when I cover our strategic priorities. Interest and other expense increased 18% versus prior year to about $97 million in Q2. This was driven by the change in the value of our deferred compensation plan. As a reminder, this mark-to-market adjustment has an equal offset in SG&A expenses and the net impacts through bottom line is zero. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 300 million, about 16 million fewer shares than last year largely due to the approximately $600 million of shares that we have repurchased year-to-date. Our Q2 operating cash flow was $372 million bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $736 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion with about $695 million held outside the US. Now I'll turn the segment results. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 8% to $33.7 billion driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of the China distribution business. Q2 segment profit was $443 million versus $514 million last year. As anticipated this decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact from generics program performance and to a lesser extent by customer contract renewals, a China divestiture and opioids litigation expenses. These headwinds were partially offset by the strong performance of specialty as well as by pharmaceutical distribution brand volume and initial benefit from our cost optimization work. Now I'll briefly provide an update regarding the New York state Opioid Stewardship Act. As many of you know in December. A Federal District Court ruled against this law. As a result, during Q2 we've reversed $5 million we had originally accrued in Q1. We also revert the $29 million we accrued for all of calendar 2017 and for the first half of calendar 2018 which was excluded from non-GAAP as we said previously. Additionally, we did not need to incur the assessment amount that we originally contemplated for Q2. We continue to monitor this matter and we're following the appeal filed in January by the State of New York. Continuing to medical, segment revenue was down slightly to $4 billion driven by the divestitures of the China distribution and naviHealth businesses offset by growth from existing customers. We saw strong top and bottom line growth in Cardinal Health at-Home and services. Segment profits decreased 14% to $188 million. This decline reflects increased costs as well as the divestitures I just mentioned. The increased costs related to Cardinal Health brand products and include raw materials prices, SG&A expenses related to TSA exit and global supply chain improvement initiatives. These costs were partially offset by the non-repeat of the prior year Patient Recovery inventory step up charge. Regarding the raw materials, we're beginning to see some encouraging data points in the spot markets. However, remember the changes in spot prices take time to flow through our P&L due to the lack in manufacturing and supply chain cost accounting roll outs. As part of the broader work [ph] to drive efficiencies across the medical segment we're streamlining the global supply chain for the full portfolio including Patient Recovery and Cordis as Mike mentioned. Regarding Patient Recovery, we're pleased with the performance of the business and the progress we made to-date. Overall, the integration work is progressing as expected. Our team continues to work through some of the typical challenges being in large integrations and this work will continue over the balance of the calendar year. We anticipate exiting the remaining minor transition agreement by mid fall as planned. Finally, we continue to be on track to meet our accretion goal. A quick update on Cordis, we continue to make progress on our stabilization plan and metrics continue to improve. We have seen an improvement in service levels and nearly 20% reduction in SKUs and significantly better management of consigned inventory. Now I would like to share few updates regarding our full year assumptions, with half of our fiscal year complete and based on our expectations for certain industry dynamics and business trend. We decided to raise our non-GAAP EPS guidance where range of $4.97 to $5.17. This reflects in narrowing of a range from $0.25 to $0.20. We made the following additional changes to our full year assumptions. First, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth primarily driven by pharmaceutical segments. Second, though our tax rate may fluctuate by quarter as we saw in Q1 and Q2 we expect a tax rate in the range of 25% to 27% for the full year. Third, we revised our dilutive weighted average shares outstanding to the range of 300 million to 302 million shares. For the segment assumptions, with a strong revenue increase we saw in the first half. We expect pharmaceutical segment revenue to grow in the mid-to-high single digits. This is mainly driven by brand sales to large customers. One item of note, in January brand inflation increases came in within the range we were expecting. As we have discussed before brand inflation represent a very small portion of our total brand income as income from DSA fees accounts for nearly 95% of our total brand compensation. Finally, for the medical segment. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. A key factor impacting this change in our assumption is foreign exchange. Let me now provide an update regarding a few of the strategic priority that we have discussed throughout the year. Regarding our cost optimization work, we now expect to exceed $100 million of annualized savings for fiscal 2019. We also expect to exceed the aggregate $200 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2020. We continue to empower our employees to reset spending practices across the enterprise and this work will increase productivity, support our priorities and fuel growth initiatives. Moving onto strategic uses of cash during the quarter we deployed capital primarily to fund capital expenditure needs of business in our quarterly dividend. Yesterday, our board approved a regular quarterly dividend which will payable to shareholders on April 15. Most importantly, we continue to increase our level of scrutiny and selectivity regarding capital allocation across all categories. In closing, we're delivering on our commitments year-to-date and we're pleased to deliver Q2 performance that was better than anticipated. As a result, we were able to increase our full year expectations. We're beginning to see our strategic work and our operational performance aligned and we'll continue to build on this momentum. With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and we'll take our first question from Ross Muken with Evercore. Please go ahead. Ross Muken : I'd love maybe a little bit more color on sort of the specialty solution outperformance, maybe just a bit of sort of background on maybe couple of the pieces that are kind of contributing and seems like that business is been sort of outperforming now for some time and maybe just give us a feel for in the context. I think the space trying to get better economics on those sort of relationships both on some of the manufacture service but on the base distribution and how you've sort of done in terms of essentially getting fair value for the services you're providing in that business. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Ross. Appreciate the question. I would say that the performance in specialty is really cuts across several different areas. First of all, our operating downstream to our both physician offices and clinics we continue to see good traction there. Continuing to win some volume in that space and so that's been generating some of the better than expected performance for us. We've also been able to see benefit from just the pure growth of the specialty business alone. Our manufacture partners continue to launch new items, grow their share and that's obviously benefiting us. We've also had strong cost control in our specialty unit like the rest of our units. They're getting after, their activities and really focusing on what are the value added activities. And then lastly our upstream services we continue to gain traction in our hub, our 3PL business continues to win share and so really it's across the board. I wouldn't say it's any one thing particularly that stands out, it's just more across the board, it's all the performance by the team. Ross Muken : That's helpful and maybe, just to follow-up. It seems like inflation kind of came in at least on the branded side in line. In lieu of all of this sort of noise coming out of the government and Azar sort of latest proposal. I guess how are you thinking about sort of the inflation environment for the rest of the year and what you're going to see maybe for the foreseeable future. Mike Kaufmann : Yes it's a great question. At least for this fiscal year, I would tell you that really - January is really the month that we expect it to see all of the inflation. So we have very, very little built in for the rest of the year. So that is not something that we would call out as a risk for the second half of the year. It was really a big focus on January for us, would have come within that range that we were expecting. It did come in within that range, inflation that we were expecting and we were able to work with our manufacturing partners there and really get about what we were expecting. So for the rest of the year, it's really not a factor. As far as next year it's just a little too early for us to comment on that. There's so many moving parts related to that and some of our agreements will be obviously expiring and looking at renegotiating and so we're going to be looking at trying to move more to non-contingent as we can, since we're well over 90% in fact, we're nearly 95% at this point in time that we would look to move more there as we can, but again nothing to rest of the year of any materiality. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : I guess Mike, maybe just to pick up there. If I look at the implied back half guide specifically for the pharma segment, the revenue trending above original expectation so you raised the expectations for the full year there, you left the EBIT expectations the same. So obviously implying slightly worse EBIT in the back half than maybe what you were previously thinking. Just little curios if there is any changing dynamics or things in the marketplace that you're seeing today that maybe you weren't seeing when you laid out the original fiscal 2019 plan that might help explain the maybe implied lower EBIT margin expectations in the back half. Jorge Gomez : Bob, good morning. This is Jorge. Let me try to help you with that. The first thing I would say is, we with the first half of the year behind us, we feel good about our guidance. We feel so good that we decided to raise our total guidance for the year. If you look at the over performance in Q2, you probably want to think about it in three buckets and certainly from an operational perspective some of our business have been better. We talk about specialty, strong volume in pharma distribution was good in the quarter and some of the business units within the medical segments performed well and so that is given us confidence for deliver results in the second half of the year. The trending is good from an operational standpoint. In Q2, we also had one-times are non-repeatable items or items that impact - don't have any impact to the bottom line. So for example, the ruling in New York about the opioid assessment, this is something that we have accrued for in Q1, we reversed that amount and then some amount that we had contemplated for Q2 we did not have to accrue and then finally there are some sizable items related to for example deferred compensation for a compensation had a positive impact in SG&A, but a negative impact of the same magnitude in below the line with the net zero impact to the bottom line, so that is something that has no bearing with respect to trajectory going into the second half. And we had some corporate expenses timing between Q2 and Q3 that again they have no impact to the overall year. So when we look at the benefit in Q2, all the R's and O's, the trajectory of the business as we decided to raise guidance and based on all of those factors this guidance reflects our best estimate for the second half, which by the way as I said before we feel good about the trajectory of most of our businesses within the context of the guidance we're providing. Robert Jones : Great, that's helpful Jorge and I guess maybe just a follow-up on the pharma segment. Not necessarily new news, but you guys highlighted the generic program as remaining a very large headwind. I just wanted to better understand what's at play there. Is this just because you're lapping strong contribution from last year or is there some changing dynamics in the generic marketplace that is weighing on the generics business. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say it's anything new, in fact what I would say is that our generic program performance remains essentially consistent quarter-to-quarter. Remember it's made up of several different things. We're seeing sell side deflation remain consistent quarter-to-quarter. Obviously we've said in the past, we'd like to see that improved but it is least remaining consistent. We have also our buy side Red Oak continues to perform as expected and then we have launches and penetration all of again which are about as expected, but that sell side deflation as we noted at the very beginning of the year, we felt that the pressure from the sell side would offset the positives we see and launches penetration and costing and there would be a net headwind for the year and that continues to what we're seeing. So I wouldn't say there is anything new, but when we look at it in total, the program continues to be our largest year-over-year headwind. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : I want to go back to sort of the early comments around the specialty segment. The performance you're talking about and certainly performance in the overall revenue pharma segment kind of mirrors what we're seeing across the peer group as well. Is there anything sort of characteristic you said that's changing the market overall as well that is kind of that we're kind of seeing this occur more broadly based. Mike Kaufmann : Not being [indiscernible] out to me, I mean it continues to be a strong growing market. So it's one of the fastest growing components obviously, the pharmaceutical segment. So I just think the pure market growth, the manufacturers are doing a good job of driving growth on their drugs and we're benefiting from that growth from them. And then as I said, we continue to see improvements on our both our downstream penetration with accounts and growth of new accounts and then upstream, we've had some businesses that we've talked about that we were working on and growing for instance our hub which was still relatively a new business continues to improve its performance and our third party logistics business continues to win in the marketplace with the investments we've made in that business, so I wouldn't say anything specific other than it is just overall a strong growing market and we participate in many different areas in it. Charles Rhyee : Okay and then maybe follow-up for Jorge. I think last quarter you said you were expecting the second quarter consolidated operating profit to be more sort of in line with 1Q. I think you've touched on some of the factors that have lifted the outperformance here in the second quarter. Was there anything - were there any other drivers that you point out and maybe you can help size some of these for us. Thanks. Jorge Gomez : I already kind of listed all of the items that resulted in the over performance as I've said before. Good underlying trends in most of our businesses and then we had some one-timers related to corporate or timing issues related to corporate expenses, deferred compensation. I think I've covered all of the items that really explain what happened in the quarter relative to our expectations, we're really pleased with how the business has performed this quarter. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink. Please go ahead. David Larsen : Can you talk a little bit about Cordis, I think you said that there is more effective management around consigned inventory. Did revenue for quarters grow? And what exactly is leading to that, tighter management, the inventory where new technology systems deployed, were new folks hired? Thanks a lot. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks for the question, Dave. Cordis in the quarter was not a driver for us. We continue to make progress. The stabilization plan that Jon Giacomin and team are leading is yielding good results from an operational perspective. Our metrics in that business continued to improve. I think overall the commercial health of that business has been good for a [indiscernible] quarters now and with respect to specific around infrastructure and technology, is what we have discussed before. We have been working pretty intensively in terms of having better data, their demand planning systems, processes around consigned inventory have been put in place and we're beginning to see the overall results of all of this work. So given all of that, we continue to expect that Cordis will be on a [indiscernible] to profitable growth by the end of fiscal 2019. David Larsen : Okay and then did revenue grow for quarters? Mike Kaufmann : As I said before, the trend in the business has been positive for the last several quarters and the commercial health is good. There is as I indicated in my prepared remarks overall in the medical segment, FX, foreign exchange was a small headwind in the quarter and that impacts kind of all of our businesses across the medical segment. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our question next from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : When we think for the second half of the year? If we normalize, do you have I think a little bit lower tax rate and lower share count and when we normalize for that. The second half guide seems to indicate a very wide range down on EPS down 4% to up 3%. So when you think about kind of that range, what should we be, what are you watching forward? So what are the risks that could lead you to kind of dead down 4% that could materialize in the next couple of quarters because you know what branded inflation, so you have a pretty good sight of view to that. So what are the other things that could materialize in the second half for you? Jorge Gomez : Thanks Ricky for the quarter. As I've said before we have been looking at the entire cadence of the quarters with first half behind us, we feel much better about the cadence, about the ramp from first half to second half. There are always items that could create some changes and starting with probably the easiest one that you've seen a few times looked [indiscernible], the tax rate we have narrowed the range of the tax rate but it could be from quarter-to-quarter, it could fluctuate. We could continue to watch other drivers of profitability in each of the segments. In the case of medical, I indicated that for example cost especially around raw materials is we're seeing good signs in terms of spot market prices, that is something that we continue to watch. So there's a lot of puts and takes and when we put all of those together. We believe the second half of reasonable good ramp up for us and the range is reasonable. I think the most important point is, overall we're raising the bottom of a range, we're raising the top, we're narrowing the range and that is a good indication that net-net all of our risk and opportunities are trending in the right direction and we feel more comfortable about the rest of the year. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay and then one follow-up. When you talk about revenues, you talk about obviously the specialty, the medical, the strong prints volume in pharma. Can you just explain to us and what is driving the strength in brand volume? Because we're not necessarily seeing in IMS [ph] so what's driving that better performance on the branded side. Mike Kaufmann : I think it's more customer mix than anything. We partnered with some very strong customers in the marketplace that I think are growing nicely and through a combination of mostly organic growth with probably some small M&A themselves there and we're just benefiting from being partnered with strong partners. I think it's really what is, was this than more than anything else. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Jorge I want to revisit some of the delta at least in terms of the two quarter performance. You talked about some level of timing related to corporate expenses. That being said, the original commentary you grew sequentially EBIT by about $96 million, usually there is a typical sequential step up in this quarter. But if you think about what was different from this quarter. How much of it was timing oriented versus how much of it was structural in terms of some of the restructuring programs and business optimization that you're pursuing. Jorge Gomez : Michael, thanks for the question. I won't be able to tell you exactly the relative magnitude of each of the pieces, but I would tell you the items that were timing related or that had no impact to the bottom line are sizable. So good performance from a lot of our businesses, but those two items timing of corporate expenses and is a pretty sizable items. So that is one of the key reasons why we're not letting that flow through in the guidance for the rest of the year. Michael Cherny : Understood. Thanks I'll get back in the queue. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Mike, I just wanted to go back to your comments around quarter three. You talked about refinding the geographic footprint. I think when [indiscernible] together last month, you talked about going from roughly 60 countries to maybe around 45. Can you give us more color on, is that the right number to think about that you're going to go down to 45 countries for Cordis? I understood you said profitability by the end of the 2019, but can you also just leave in your thoughts around Cardinal brand products. We thought an increase in cost here in this quarter, but are there opportunities when you think about the countries now that you're overlaying in Cordis. Have you made the investments you need to make, so that when we think about going towards the back half of this year and that profitability is that driven by your branded products? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the questions. Let me try to catch on each one of those. First of all I think, Cordis, there's probably two things we're doing to try simplify the business. One is, not only reducing the number of countries and your numbers you mentioned are approximately right. But we're looking to continue to reduce that number and we're being very specific and detailed as we evaluate each country to make sure that at the end of the day, we're looking at what is the true growth potential in that country, what are all the other potential hidden cost and risk that might be in that country compared to our current footprint and ability to grow? How might we be in that country in a different way? Do we have to have our own commercialization and can we just work with distributors? But I would fully expect to see us continue to reduce our footprint little bit there. Also the other thing that we've done, is we've taken a really hard look at our skews and so far we've reduced about our skews by about 20% in Cordis because we had a lot of slow to no moving skews which again drives potential inventory risk, also manufacturing cost and so we're trying to focus our customers on the skews that matter for us and move them from slow to no moving type of skews that were out there and move them to the right mix of skews to help our cost structure. So those are two big things that we're doing in Cordis and as Jorge said, the commercial health of the business continues to be strong and we have seen some FX headwinds, but the overall commercial strength continues to be strong and we continue to try to be very careful about, the way we're going after some of our SG&A right now. While we maintain that top line and clean up some of these other things like inventory visibility in that. As far as our Cardinal Health branded products. I would say that, we're really taking a holistic approach on those, to look not only at the breadth of that line where we manufacture it, how we manufacture it i.e. our overall global footprint. But also taking a look at those countries where we sell those products and are we doing it in the right way. So we want to play in the countries where we believe there is future growth and where we can win and obviously look at other opportunities up to an including exiting countries where we don't think it has the right growth trajectories or the opportunities for us to win. Lisa Gill : Great. And I guess just follow-up [indiscernible] Jorge. I know everyone keep coming back to try and understand the cadence of earnings. Just so I understand that correctly, when you last told us that things would look sequentially similar between the two quarters. You were not anticipating New York state opioid being reversed. You were not anticipating that, the expense timing around some things and some of the benefit being pulled forward to December as well as deferred comp. so those are kind of the three things that when you look at that, that was the big difference between when we spoke last and what you actually reported in the quarter? Is that the right way to think about it? Jorge Gomez : Correct. Lisa. It's exactly right. Those are the unexpected pieces that all came in our way. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : So another question from me and coming back to the commodity spot pricing and timing etc. it sounds like you're really not raising the guidance today for that metric. You cited the other three buckets of outperformance for fiscal 2Q. But you know - as coming back to our discussion around this last quarter as you guys mentioned it's hard to calculate the overall inflation, but you do have the example in the 10-K that again the hypothetical 10% increase in key commodity inputs will be about $0.10 hit to overall EPS. So now some of these trends are softening in your favor, you mentioned the data points and everything else. I guess I'm just curios within the current guidance range, could less commodity inflation risk still be EPS driver into the magnitude of $0.10 plus within the guidance range. Just curios for the back half of the year how much climbing inflation could move EPS, was really what the question is? Jorge Gomez : Steven good morning, thanks for the question. So commodities and raw materials costs continues to be a headwind for the rest of the year up. What I indicated earlier is, that is trending in the right direction. However there is always a long lag between the time we see those positive changes in the spot markets and when we see the benefits in the P&L. So I think the most relevant part about that payment is that, is one of the reasons why we are comfortable with raising guidance because although it continues to be at risk based on the spot prices we're seeing today. We don't believe at this time that could get worse for the rest of the year and so that's how we're thinking about that piece. Steven Valiquette : So just to be clear then, so the guidance raise today does incorporate a little bit the better outlook on climbing inflation. Jorge Gomez : Yes. All of the - it is - our views on the trending on commodities is one of the factors that is contemplated in guidance. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Mike, with respect to the HHS proposal last week and also starting to think about what a world of discounts might look like, there's a question raised around how the actual flow of funds may occur in maybe, if there's a role for distributors to play. I think for your peers, we understand some of their assets and relationships that enable them to play, could you tell us a little bit about how Cardinal might be able to play a role? Mike Kaufmann : Yes absolutely. First of all, this announcement around the safe harbor changes was not unexpected. And as you can imagine we like many other support efforts to lower prescription drug cost for patients and we're truly committed to engaging with the administration and the entire system to figure out how best to do that. That being said, I guess I would to your answer I'd probably put it in two buckets. I agree there are opportunities for the industry as the whole to help facilitate solutions to get rebates possibly down to the patient. The best way to think about it is, we just like our competitors maintain sophisticated charge back systems already with the manufacturer and with our customer. so every day we're managing thousands of transactions between customers and suppliers and so while this would be definitely be at a more detailed level, if we needed to do something down to the patient that the script. It is something that, as a company and as an industry we believe that we could get after and it's something that I think that the whole industry understands well. The importance of the role that we play in healthcare in general and the important role that we play for manufacturers to be able to do this, so I do think that we are as well as positioned as anybody to continue to help in that. And then, I know some people have some concerns would it change the overall list prices and other things like that in the marketplace and I think, well if it did, we do feel confident in our value proposition that we talked about multiple times that we work with manufacturers. They understand the value of our proposition and we constantly work with them around that and that we'll be able to adjust, our overall pricing mechanisms with manufacturers to remain whole on the dollar set we receive [ph]. Eric Percher : I appreciate both those comments. So I understand that charge back piece, is there any role that Cardinal plays today at the point of sale? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, in some ways we do. Obviously we work with customers for instance in the area of medication therapy management. Whether you call that point of sale? Are we connected with our customers pharmacy systems? Yes through inventory management, through medication therapy management and through other connectivity of communicating with our pharmacy customers on a daily basis. Yes, we have connection with them specifically related to this particular issue. I think we have enough connectivity that we can work with them through other solutions and through opportunities with the industry to drive benefit. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian [indiscernible] with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Company Representative : Jorge, just a question on margins. As I think about the pharma segment, obviously you had some you're still trying to lap some repricing. But how are you thinking directionally about margin trend past the next quarter in the pharmaceutical segment? Thanks. Jorge Gomez : Thanks for the question. So as we go into Q3, as all of you know Q3 is our best quarter in terms of pharmaceutical segment margin profit, so that's going to be normally higher than Q1, Q2 and even Q4. Other than that, I don't see any significant change with respect to margins, trends and to pharma business. Obviously a lot of cost initiative that Mike was referring to, a lot of pricing initiatives that we have going on. We are always trying to expand margins in that business and across all businesses. So I don't expect to see any again other than the seasonality in Q3 related to brand inflation. And for this year, within the guidance range we've provided I don't see any major fluctuations in margins for this pharma segment. Unidentified Company Representative : Got it. Thank you. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John Ransom : Just following up on that last question. I think we've all - we've been in a three-year journey of margin decline in pharma high single-digit, low double-digit declines. Are you now saying the current, so let's say that your sustainable revenue growth is in the 7% range, are you now saying after lapping this year you think you can hold margins flat and generate high single-digit revenue growth in that segment, are we still looking at margin pressures on absolute basis because of all the things you talked about. Mike Kaufmann : At this point in time, we're not going to get into FY 2020 guidance. All I can really say is that, we feel good about who we're partnered with our customers and continue to feel that we've partnered with the right folks, we'll win as they win in the marketplace and but as far as margin rate, the impact of our generics program year-over-year. It's just a little bit too early to say whether that will continue to be a headwind or what size that will be next year as we continue to evaluate all of the components, we mentioned we're going to have to - have obviously our thoughts around what the sale side and deflation rates are going to be as well as launches, penetration in buy side and so little too early on that. I can't tell you, that we're going to continue to be focused on being aggressive on cost and being trying to focus on, the areas that we believe we can grow and stay laser focused on those. John Ransom : Sure and just the other things I appreciate the comments. Just following up on another thread. Let's just say hypothetically that the manufacturers look at the safe harbor changes and decide to move to a low net price model and we see something like on branded drugs 30% compression and gross to net and the actual revenue dollars for Cardinal would be on the branded side, would be compressed. Just help us understand the process by you would have to go back and re-cut, I'm assuming hundreds of contracts between your manufacturers and your customers and is there any sort of safe harbor provision and your contracts are just going to be, sort of lengthy protracted re-contracting cycle as we see a big bang change in the industry pricing. Mike Kaufmann : Yes great question and couple things. I think obviously we can't speak for the manufacturers, but there is an obviously a lot of things they have to look at. There are lot of implications in reducing lag prices for them that make it a very complicated and somewhat difficult thing to do for them when it comes related to returns and how they would price customers where the differentiated price setting and all those type of things, it gets very difficult. But assuming that just using as a hypothetical, if they did I think there's two things I would keep in mind. First of all remember one of the most important things to keep in mind, is that our downstream pricing is also attached to lack or list price. And so not only well our overall dollars that we earn from manufacturers be initially reduced on day one, but the overall dollars that we pass to customers would be reduced on day one, too. So there's a natural hedge against the overall size of that, that reduces some of the impact to distributors and then also, secondly as you can imagine with all the talk around this for the last 12 months or so, we have been working with manufacturers to change the way our contracts are structured, if there was a significant change it lacks to be able to renegotiate contracts quickly and for the ones that we're still in contracts with. They know our expectation and more importantly they know our value. They continue to believe, I believe in the overall wholesaler value proposition. They know through our discussions and through our work on our next best alternative that there is no better way to get their products to market, at a fair price and cost. And I believe what this industry does and believe that the pharma manufacturers do too and they want us to be healthy and so while it's not something you solve in a week, when it changes. It is not something that I would see as a longer term headwinds that our conversations have been very positive on both our value and our ability to change our agreements to reflect the dollars that we currently get. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Just one quick follow-up to that. What you said earlier that you thought in the contract renegotiations that, on a dollar to dollar basis, it would be the same? Are you thinking like literally in dollars or you're thinking about ROIC, meaning your inventories would be a lot less, your round of capital outlay such that your returns would look the same but maybe not the actual dollars. Or you're actually thinking that the dollars themselves in terms of the contracting you think would still remain the same. Mike Kaufmann : Yes I still believe that the dollars would be the same. I think that your comment around ROIC, there might be some changes to that as you take a look at overall, the whole model and those things are always considered when we work with manufacturers. When they ask us to carry more or allow us to carry less inventory, we work with manufacturers. But generally we see this as something where we're really truly focused on the dollars that we received as the value for the services, we provide and we would expect that those dollars would be match be very similar over the long-term as where they are today. Kevin Caliendo : Second question, you mentioned earlier. You don't expect any more brand price increases for the rest of the year. I'm assuming you were talking about your fiscal year. Generally speaking what about the calendar year. I'm not asking for 2020 guidance, I'm just talking about do you expect the typical June or July 1 sort of price increases as well. Do you think there is going to be anything different with that or are you expecting that for the full calendar year that January was going to be much larger percentage in terms of magnitude and depth or breadth of price increases? Mike Kaufmann : Yes it's a fair question. First of all to be clear, it was our fiscal year I was talking about and that we would expect relatively immaterial increase, not - it wouldn't be zero but we don't expect a significant amount of increase as we see now in June 30. The majority was in January and it occurred within the range we expected. So that was just more to help you understand, we don't see a lot of risk, if it were absolutely zero between what we have in and what's left to do. Regarding the whole year, I don't want to get into a lot of forecasting but this past year what I can say is that, at the beginning of the year we did expect more July increases than we actually ended up seeing. So at the beginning of the year we did expect the old traditional of a little bit in July and then some spread out and more in January. Instead what we saw, was less in July and the rest of the year and more pushed to January. So while the overall dollars were less year-over-year in January or in total for the year, there was a higher percentage in the month of January and so it's hard to say for right now, but it's probably a reasonable assumption going forward, but again it's hard for us and we'll continue to listen to the administration and talk to our manufacturer partners to understand their thoughts around timing of price increases. Lisa Capodici : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : So Mike, every distributor has shown really nice revenue upside this quarter. You guys 1.7, ABC 1.6, McKesson over $1.1 billion that's summing up to about $4.5 billion in the quarter about $20 billion annualized, $18 billion annualized. So I guess my question is this, everybody say their growth is because of their big customers doing well, it's sort of unique. But it's really not unique it's the whole sector of the big three. Something has to be happening here because we have generic deflation, brand inflations running at decade low. I don't think most of us are really seeing it in the volume numbers so, I guess my question is this. There has to be a hook. I'm worried that maybe this is your big clients are actually starting to decimate the small independence. You might have a different angle on that, but I'll open it up with that. Mike Kaufmann : It's a very fair question. It's hard for me to comment on everybody's customer base. Remember there are few pieces due to some acquisitions, by folks acquiring other change in other businesses in the industry, that's having some impacts on various people's growth. Also the other thing to keep in mind and we can't get into detail specific to our customers. But remember at least in Cardinal's case which I can't comment, to is some of our customers buy certain products direct and they may change some of those products from buying direct to buying through us. The amount, their timing of their inventory builds could have an impact, you can have extra day of sales or so in a quarter. It's hard for us to know exactly when they've done that and not done that. So there's probably a few things like that moving around the numbers. I wouldn't say that it's - I would say that it's totally at the expense for instance as your comment around retail independence or anything that we continue to see that class of trade. Have similar trends to the past and continue to be healthy, but there's lot of potential moving parts which is hard for me to comment on everybody's [indiscernible]. Eric Coldwell : Do you think some of the changes with price transparency, the California rule etc.? Is it somehow driving your customers to maybe buy inventory in December that they might have historically bought in January or February? Is there some angle there that we should be investigating? Mike Kaufmann : It's hard to say how each one of the customers evaluate their balance sheet and what they want to do. It's often hard for customers due to the limited space and stuff they have in their stores to do a lot of extra buying. But to say that I can tell you, that had zero impact I can't tell you. So it might have a had a small impact because there is, as you mentioned a little bit more visibility to some of when price increases are going to occur. So that could be a potential, which is why I mentioned that you'll see potentially quarterly fluctuations on sales because of particularly when you have customers the warehouse pharmaceuticals like we do have several of our large customers warehouse [indiscernible] that depending on day of the month, their views like you said on price increases, service levels those types of things that can cause fluctuation. Eric Coldwell : [Indiscernible]. Mike Kaufmann : Okay, go ahead. Operator : I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Great, thank you very much. I want to thank all of you for joining us today because I think you can see the team continues to move forward in executing our plan and positioning Cardinal Health for the future growth. I'm proud of the work the team is doing and as we take steps to further enhance Cardinal Health's competitive position in the marketplace, support our customer base and drive shareholder value and we look forward to reporting on our future progress. Take care and have a great day, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead, ma'am. Lisa Capodici : Thank you, Jake. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez. During the call, we will provide details on our third quarter results and full year outlook. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. In addition, during the call, we will provide an update to our FY '19 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate. [Operator Instructions]. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll begin with some comments on our third quarter of fiscal 2019 and then I'll discuss our progress on a number of fronts to drive future growth. Overall, for the third quarter, revenue was up 5%, and operating results were in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.59, up 14% from the prior year. Based on the year-to-date performance and our current expectations for Q4, we are raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance to a new range of $5.02 to $5.17. As I reflect on the quarter, we made progress in several areas, including our strategic initiatives, and the team is focused on delivering full year expectations as we navigate the current health care environment. As I have recently spent time with our upstream and downstream customers, I am hearing from both that what we do and how we do it are as important today as they have ever been. We have scaled businesses that are important to our customers' success as they look for the most efficient ways to deliver high-quality care to patients. Our commitment to innovation and strong customer focus were keys to recent pharma renewals. Most notably, we've extended our distribution agreement with CVS Health for 4 years beginning July 1. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with CVS Health to further enhance our relationship with them. In that regard, we continue to work with all of our customers across our portfolio of business as they balance their commitment to deliver high-quality care with the need for efficiency. For example, retail independent pharmacy customers have navigated years of change in their pharmacies, and we've been right by their side helping them succeed in learning in the process. We are advancing solutions that help them address reimbursement, manage their inventory and place the right focus on the front of store. In addition, through our connected care platforms, we offer pharmacies' medication therapy management services and the ability to communicate with patients to help them follow their prescribed course of care. We continue to develop these types of strategic capabilities as they enable our customers to navigate the evolving pharmacy landscape where improving both patient care and the linkage among providers, payers, pharmacies and patients remains critical. In our generics program, we are seeing market dynamics and program performance consistent with prior quarters. We continue to invest in data and analytics and allocate significant time to improving the overall performance of our generics program, which is key for long-term growth in the Pharmaceutical segment. Our commitment to innovations, our customers and their success is also bearing fruit across the balance of the Pharmaceutical segment where we are seeing strong positive contributions to earnings from both specialty and nuclear. Turning to Medical. While we have made significant strides, we are disappointed with the segment performance this quarter. We would like to see quicker progress on several initiatives including our global cost structure. We continue to actively evaluate how we can accelerate our progress here while balancing our commitment to maintain service levels and deliver an outstanding customer experience. We are moving with a sense of urgency to address the opportunities for improvement we've identified in the Medical segment. Importantly, the Patient Recovery primary TSA exits are now complete, leaving just a few minor exits in action. At Cordis, the stabilization program remains on track. We continue to see improving service levels and fill rates, lower back orders and increased cost discipline. Cardinal Health at Home and our Services businesses continue to flourish. Services continues to expand its niche, providing value-added technology and logistics support to our partners while the at-Home business is capitalizing on a number of larger health care trends. Let me briefly touch on our strategic priorities. As I had shared already this morning, we are making progress in our Pharma segment, Cordis and Patient Recovery. The team has also made excellent strides on our overall cost structure, and we are already realizing the benefit in our results. Regarding capital deployment. I would note that we continue to execute a very disciplined and thoughtful strategy to fund the future growth of the business, return cash to shareholders and maintain our healthy balance sheet, and Jorge will share the details. Altogether, we remain highly focused on how we can deliver the greatest value and be nimble in the ever-changing health care environment so that we can respond to our customers' challenges. We know that our success begins with an emphasis on the longer-term, a balanced thoughtful approach to how we prioritize and deploy capital and discipline in our cost structure. The team is focused on executing across both our newer and existing businesses, investing in what makes us stronger and continuing our essential role in the health care system. The value we provide to customers and suppliers is as strong today as it has ever been. I want to thank our entire team for the work they are doing. We look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. With that, let me turn it over to Jorge. Jorge Gomez : Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter. We made operational and commercial progress in both segments to strengthen our relationships with our strategic partners and benefited from a few tax items that drove our effective tax rate below typical levels. This morning, I will focus on our Q3 performance, our view of the current fiscal year and updates on a few of our strategic initiatives. Our Q3 total operating results, which exclude tax, were in line with the expectations we had for this period when we updated guidance last quarter. Total company revenue was strong again, increasing 5% versus last year to $35.2 billion. Total company gross margin was down 8% from last year to about $1.8 billion. Operating earnings were $667 million. As Mike said, our EPS for the quarter was $1.59, a 14% increase versus last year. This increase was driven by lower tax rate and by prudent balance sheet actions which resulted in fewer shares outstanding and lower interest expense. Our Q3 effective tax rate was lower than expected, at 21.6%, driven by net favorable discrete tax items of $0.06. The largest discrete item was a True-Up related to the Patient Recovery acquisition. In the quarter, we saw a 3% improvement in SG&A due to divestitures and the ongoing benefit from our cost optimization efforts which I'll discuss when I cover strategic initiatives. Interest and other expenses improved 24% versus prior year to about $62 million. It was driven by the change in the value of our deferred compensation plan, which as I explained previously, is fully offset above the line in corporate expenses and had no impact on the net income or EPS line. Average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 299 million, about 16 million fewer shares than last year. We generated very strong operating cash flow of $1.5 billion in Q3, which includes a large benefit from the timing of inventory purchases. Our year-to-date operating cash flow is $2.2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with about $800 million held outside the U.S. Now I'll turn to segment results, starting with the Pharma segment. Sales to Pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution customers were strong in the quarter, driving segment revenue growth of 6% to $31.4 billion. Although segment profit of $536 million was lower than last year, it was ahead of our expectations from a quarter ago. The 10% decrease versus last year reflects the negative impact from generics program performance, prior customer renewals and opioid litigation expenses. These headwinds were partially offset by Specialty, which again delivered very strong top and bottom line growth. Of note, key customers continue to reward Cardinal Health with a troth of long-lasting partnerships. The renewal of CVS Health validates both our strong value proposition and our reputation as a trusted and effective long-term partner. Turning to Medical. Segment revenue for Q3 was down slightly to $3.9 billion driven by previously discussed divestitures, offset by growth from existing customers. Excluding divestitures and FX, revenue was up low-single digits. Segment profit decreased 22% to $155 million driven by the performance of Cardinal Health Brand products. Market dynamics in our product businesses as well as incremental supply chain costs contributed to this lower-than-expected performance. In response to these challenges, we are moving forward with the work that I mentioned last quarter to drive efficiencies across the Medical segment through refining our commercial, operational and data capabilities. We currently have teams deployed to support each of these pillars of work through activities including global product and geography rationalization, supply chain optimization and selling strategies. Now let me share a few updates on some specific business areas. What we refer to internally as a Medical Solution businesses, which includes patient recovery and our legacy Cardinal Health brand products, is experiencing challenges relative to market dynamics and supply chain integration activities. However, the team is actively engaged in multiple initiatives to drive greater operational efficiency and to address the below-target service levels experienced over the last few months. As a result of this work, we are seeing improvement in service level trends, particularly in the U.S., where the levels are reaching 6-month high. At the same time, all areas of our Medical businesses are showing strong growth. We see a strength in our strategic accounts which are growing above market rates. Also, Cardinal Health at-Home had another terrific quarter. The customer pipeline for this business is healthy, and our cost management was extremely effective, producing another quarter of double-digit growth. National brand distribution had a strong performance as did its services which delivered above-market growth in Q3. At Cordis, we are seeing top line growth in several geographies, most notably in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. As we move forward with our stabilization plan, we are seeing improvement in fill rates and backorders, with Q3 reflecting the lowest backorder levels we have seen in 18 months. Also, service levels are improving due to our work on SKU rationalization, and additional technologies will help us better manage both inventory and sales productivity. We also continue to evaluate product mix and partnership agreements. Our key challenge remains our cost structure, primarily outside the U.S, which we are actively working to address. Turning to our full year outlook for fiscal '19. Based on our most current expectations for our effective tax rate and operating performance in both segments, we are raising the lower end of our EPS guidance from $4.97 to $5.02. Our updated range for the year is $5.02 to $5.17. We are making the following changes to our assumptions for the full year. For the segment assumptions, due to the dynamic that to continue to experience in Medical, we now expect segment profit to be down low to mid-single digit. For our corporate assumptions, we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This update reflects a few favorable discrete tax items, including the impact of tax reforms, the legal entity restructuring work we completed earlier this year and the tax true-up related to Patient Recovery that I mentioned before. Also, we now anticipate our interests and other expenses as well as capital expenditures for the year to be lower. We expect interest and other expenses in the range of $330 million to $350 million. The new range for capital expenditures is $310 million to $340 million. I'll now provide an update on some of our strategic initiatives. First, regarding our cost optimization efforts. We will exceed our initial commitments of $100 million in annualized savings by the end of fiscal '19 and the aggregate $200 million by the end of fiscal '20. We will provide more precise numbers when we finish the year. To deliver these savings we have developed a compressive data-driven approach that extends beyond budgeting and is supported by an organized program structure. Leaders across company are accountable for initiatives that we are rigorously identifying, operationalizing and tracking to support these commitments, and all of this work is enabled by a more agile, forward-thinking mindset that we are embedding at every level of the enterprise. This broad approach is standing across strategy, tactics and culture will enable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. We said previously that we will reinvest some of these savings we generate from these work back into the enterprise. For these investments, we are focused on opportunities to rapidly implement and enable digital technologies with the goal of streamlining our processes, creating greater efficiencies and optimizing our data capabilities. We will share updates as specific initiatives or operationalize.  Second, with respect to capital, we have generated strong cash flow and remained very disciplined in our approach to capital deployment. Our financial flexibility allows us to efficiently fund both current operations and investment opportunities for long-term growth. As part of this disciplined approach, we plan to use cash on hand to repay $1 billion of debt that matures next month. Additionally, we maintained a significant level of scrutiny and selectivity regarding all allocations such as capital expenditures and acquisitions with a focus on high thresholds for strategic fit, ability to execute and return metrics. Overall, as I look back on the quarter and year-to-date, while internal and external dynamics continue to evolve, we continue to be resilient and agile. We remain thoroughly focused on delivering our commitments as we finish the year. With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Jonathan Young : This is Jonathan Young on for Steve today. Just going to CVS renewal. Were there any changes in the contract? Or anything that we should consider given that you guys got the renewal? Michael Kaufmann : Thanks for the question, John. This is -- first of all, we're really excited and pleased to extend our partnership with CVS. As you know, they've been a long-term customer of ours. Well, I can tell you that the contract is for a 4-year period. Actually, the new pricing goes into effect July 1. And other than that, it's same business and same typical structure that we've had in the past. Nothing that I would call out differently. Jonathan Young : Okay, great. And then just turning to the Medical business. I guess kind of what were the challenges that you're kind of seeing in the business related to supply chain activities, et cetera? Jorge Gomez : Let me take that question. Good morning. Yes. We feel that we had a difficult quarter in Medical in Q3. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the largest driver in the quarter was the performance of our Cardinal brand products. Within that, I think there are 2 key buckets : the first one is just the normal market dynamics that we normally overcome through actions around mix and commercial efficiency and volume. This time and in this quarter, we were not able to offset those dynamics because there were additional challenges from a supply chain cost integration work that resulted in backorders and higher expenses as we were trying to meet on commitments to our customers. Those are kind of 2 main things. This is what we're doing about that.  We clearly have deployed a number of teams to work on the short-term issues around operational efficiency, below-target service levels, and we are seeing improvements in that. Our service levels and backorder trends towards the end of the quarter were improving. And in fact, in the U.S., our service levels are reaching now a 6-month high. But from a long-term perspective, we have -- I mentioned this in my remarks as well, we are working on global product and geography rationalization to simplify our business, we are trying to optimize our supply chain, and we are making some good strides on that. And working in our selling strategies as well. Obviously, all of these actions have different time lines, and some of them are being executed very quickly. And as I said before, we're seeing improvements. All initiatives will take a little bit longer. Overall, we're actually encouraged with the underlying demand of this business, and we have a very strong conviction about the value proposition we're bringing to our customers every single day. Operator : I'm going to move to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I just want to follow back up as we think about the Cardinal Health Brand products on 2 levels. Just one, when you talk, Jorge, about the supply chain cost, is that actually commodity cost or is it the actual process that you just described at the last question? And then Mike, can you talk about the current competitive landscape? It appears that just in the peer U.S. distribution you have a competitor that's really struggling in the marketplace. I would have anticipated that, that would have created opportunities for someone with a strong balance sheet like Cardinal to continue to gain from market share. So just some thoughts around the competitive landscape would be helpful. Michael Kaufmann : Great. I'll let Jorge start, and then I'll answer your question. Jorge Gomez : Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. The cost challenges, I guess, expand over all of the areas of the P&L. So from a manufacturing perspective, we have, as you indicated -- commodities is actually one of a headwind and there are other elements within cost that are creating some short-term challenges. And then the overall supply chain as we finish integration work and as we continue to improve our network, especially outside the U.S., we have experienced a higher cost, which essentially stems from the fact that we want to make sure that we balance cost with servicing our customers at the best possible level. So all of those areas of the P&L from a cost perspective impacted the segment this quarter. Michael Kaufmann : And as far as the competitive environment in the Medical side, we continue to see a competitive environment, no differently than we really have in the past. I, obviously, don't want to comment on any specific competitor, but I think the dynamics are similar than they have been in past. We feel really good about our value proposition. And we really want to make sure that we're focused on winning and retaining the customers that appreciate our value proposition, which is being both a strong distribution medical business and a products company that people see as someone that can bring them equal to or better products at lower cost. Lisa Gill : Just so I understand all the comments around this. As we think about this going into next year, Mike, I mean, do you feel like you can really get your arms around these costs continue to win customers based on what you just talked about? Or do you think that this is kind of a multiyear challenge as we think about it and I'll stop there? Michael Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa. I think Jorge -- from what he said, I think, emphasizes a few things. First of all, I think there are some things that were very fixable in a short-term period, and we put the people on that and we've made very good solid progress. Some of the other things, for instance, evaluating our global manufacturing footprint, looking at our U.S. distribution footprint. We believe there's areas for opportunity to streamline and maximize the efficiency in both our manufacturing and distribution footprints as well as the overall supply chain. Those aren't going to happen overnight. Those are going to take time as we work through those because ultimately, as much as we'd like to go faster, for us, the most important thing is keeping our eye on our customers and we don't want to do anything that would disrupt the overall demand for the products, which we continue to see strong, and we still believe in our value proposition. So it's truly balancing what we know our opportunities and our footprint making sure that we don't let any customers down. Operator : We'll now move to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Thanks for the question. I guess just to stick there with Medical, Mike, want to make sure I understand it does seem like a fairly dramatic shift from last quarter's update. So does this boil down to really just some fulfillment issues that created higher cost, which I would imagine obviously would be within your control to fix? Or is it that plus a bigger issue that you're seeing as far as the macro backdrop in that sector? I know, Jorge, you mentioned demand still felt really good for the lines of business here. So just really want to make sure I understand what shifted from last quarter to this quarter? And was it really more just around some fulfillment miscues and costs that obviously would be associated with taking that? Michael Kaufmann : Yes, and thanks for the follow-up. Totally get the question. And it obviously was a significant change on our assumption for this business, so very fair observation. I would say first of all, we've said several different times that when you exit TSA they can sometimes be lumpy. I would say the exits that we've had recently have been little bit more lumpier than we would have expected, and some of those created some service level -- unexpected service level challenges Jorge mentioned in our Q3 and we're still working through those as quickly as possible, but still little bit of work to do on that. And as Jorge mentioned, we are seeing some challenges in our cost structure, some of it related to commodities and FX, some of it related to some cost initiatives that we hope to get to quicker than we had to slow down on it in order to make sure we don't have service level disruptions. Jorge, would you add anything? Jorge Gomez : Just, Bob, to be clear, the change in expectations in the segment was mostly driven by volume issues related to our own internal challenges in terms of bill rates, and we had backorders throughout the quarter. So as I indicated from a demand perspective, we are seeing -- we haven't seen any major change -- any changes that since last time we talked about Medical. So it's mostly related to volume issues within our business. Robert Jones : That's really helpful. I guess just one follow-up if we could shift over to Pharma. You guys mentioned obviously good performance in the quarter, but you did mention one of the negatives being the generic performance, the performance of the generic program. Could you maybe just elaborate on what exactly you're seeing there? I'm imagining is more in the sell side but just the dynamics that led that to be a bit of a negative in the quarter would be helpful to better understand. Michael Kaufmann : Yes. In generics, we really look at all of the factors, which to us, are the inflation, deflation rates, launches, penetration, the ability of Red Oak to take out cost. And when we look at combining all of those together, we still continue to see our generics program to be a significant headwind for us both in Q3 and for the entire year. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen any one of those components change dramatically within those various components of the program, just that it continues to be consistent with prior quarters versus seeing some of the improvement we would obviously like to see. Operator : Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Jorge, could you say that you had to scale back your ambitions for cost reduction in part because of what was occurring in the Medical business this quarter? Jorge Gomez : No. Actually, our cost initiatives are tracking ahead of our internal plan. What happened this quarter is that some of those savings, we actually had to redirect and reinvest to try to fix up some of the short-term challenges that we're seeing in Medical, so that's why weren't seeing the entire benefit of cost savings dropping to the bottom line because we have been -- we have used those to cover some of the short-term challenges. But the initiatives are very much on track. And in fact, every quarter, we are gaining more confidence in those targets, and we will exceed the target for this year. Eric Percher : Okay, got it. Now and then on CapEx. I know you've reduced your expectation for the year and that had been running low in the first half. But seems to normalize this quarter. Can you give a little bit of color on your expectations there? Jorge Gomez : Yes. I think really nothing has changed fundamentally, but as we indicated we have been extremely disciplined and strict about return metrics and thresholds for investment. And then when you add that to bandwidth and the thing that we're trying to take care of in the short term, we believe that the new amount that we are guided to is a reasonable fluid amount for this year. Operator : The next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : I wanted to come back to Medical again, more of a big picture question. So if we look at the revised EBIT outlook for the segment, it looks like it's somewhere around $640 million. And based on your previous guidance for Patient Recovery, I would estimate that that's contributing somewhere around near $450 million of EBIT? So If you look at the legacy medical EBIT for Cardinal, it would be something less than $200 million. It would be helpful to us if you could rank the decline in terms of drivers over the past 2 years? It feels like the issue has shifted slightly from quarter-to-quarter, and I think it will be really helpful to have sort of the cumulative sense of what's happening in the business over the past couple of years. Jorge Gomez : Yes. Let me take the question. The -- I'd say we've been very transparent about the performance of the Cardinal brand products this quarter and the issues we are facing with respect to volume in that part of the business. Overall, the biggest parts -- the business unit within the segment, they are performing not too far from where we thought they would be, but certainly, we have some short-term challenges that we are facing. We have some businesses within the core legacy businesses, if you will, that are performing very well. As I Indicated before we have at-Home have services doing really well. And Patient Recovery -- although -- Patient Recovery were still on track to meet our operation goal that we set for this year. It is probably the projections we have now or probably lower than what we thought due to the volume challenges, but we are on track to meet the accretion goal that we have for fiscal '19. Stephen Baxter : Just a quick follow-up. Is it possible to comment on what revenue trends look like sort of ex-Patient Recovery? Jorge Gomez : The underlying revenue trends in the segment, as I indicated, when you exclude dispositions and FX, the business is tracking pretty much in line with the market and with the expectation, so no major changes there. Operator : We'll hear from David Larson with Leerink. David Larsen : Can you talk a little more about the spread we're seeing on the generic side of the house. One of your peers is obviously talking about Pharma operating income growth over the next year, but from your tone or from your comments it sounds like you're not necessarily seeing an improvement on the generic side. What's the difference in your view? What do you think the difference could be? Michael Kaufmann : Yes. It's hard to comment on other people's views of generics based on the fact that we all have different mixes and we may defining and putting different things in various buckets, but I would tell you that we do see it as more consistent with the prior quarters. And again, would not say that we have noticed any one factor. As you know, we've said that's beginning in the year that we expected that all those components to be a net headwind for us, and it has been a net headwind for us for the year, it has been the most significant one. And other than so far what we're seeing through three quarters is consistent market dynamics, it's really hard for me to comment on ours compared to someone else. David Larsen : Okay. And when you use the term consistent, like is your spread expanding or is it contracting? Is it a consistent rate of contraction in the spread? Any more thoughts there would be helpful, Mike. Michael Kaufmann : Yes. I guess when we're talking about consistent, what we're talking about is that when we take a look at deflation rates, we look at the value that we're going to get from launches, et cetera. Those are basically tracking where we expected. The deflation rate is relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. And so we -- for us, it's -- again, it's a net headwind, and so we're continuing to see consistent net headwind quarter-to-quarter not necessarily at this point in time through 3 quarters seeing that headwind reducing. Operator : We'll now hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : So not to keep going back to Medical, but as we look and think about your guidance and how it plays through the fiscal fourth quarter, would you consider that a run rate as we move into 2020, is there anything in there that's sort of onetime-ish? Or should we think about this as the base of which X any seasonality in that business that we should be thinking about growing off of moving forward? Jorge Gomez : Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for the question. As Mike indicated before, at this point, it's too early for us to start talking about trends going into next year. But obviously, we have taken down the guidance for the rest of the year. It reflects what the challenges that I discussed before that we are seeing. And we had a good first half. The second half of the year is going to be relatively consistent in terms of the challenges. And that's why we've taken the guidance for Medical for Q4. I think it's too early to start talking about the things that we're seeing going into fiscal '20. Kevin Caliendo : Okay. That's fair. And just on the CVS renewal. You said everything was the same in terms of the business structure, pricing starts July 1. Just a couple of questions around the pricing. Was it -- there's obviously an incremental step-down in the renewal contract, we understand that. Was the incremental step-down typical with most renewals that you do? And then secondly, this contract through 2023 also incorporate your relationship with Red Oak? Or is it simply on the distribution side? Michael Kaufmann : Yes, this contract was strictly on the distribution side. Our Red Oak agreement still has 5 years left on that agreement. The first 5 years will expire here at the end of roughly June 30, and then we have another 5 years left on that, so there's no current need to address that contract. Although things continue to go really well with Red Oak. Love the team and love the partnership that we've had with CVS on that. As far as deal goes, yes, it is -- the new pricing does go in effect July 1 for us. And I would say that it was -- there was nothing about it that I would say was different than what we would expect in the marketplace for customers of this size, in importance and how they're growing. And we feel that it's a fair and appropriate renewal, and are excited to have the business for 4 more years. Operator : We'll hear from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Jorge, just to clarify. You just talked about it's a little early at this point to start giving color, clarity on fiscal '20. A, is that for Medical versus the whole business? And then I guess b, when you think about what's changed this year versus previous 3Qs when you've had some visibility and color into the next year, I guess what changed your view on how you expect -- or why you decided to not give any color heading into next year? Jorge Gomez : Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. This is -- we normally don't provide any guidance into next year at the end of Q3. Our typical cadence for providing color into the next fiscal year is during our August call, so we are not changing that. This is just not consistent with our typical practices. And my comments in terms of not giving color about Medical, it applies to the entire corporation and all the numbers across the enterprise. Michael Cherny : Okay, yes, I know you don't give guidance. Usually give some color on here are some headwinds that we expect to persist, here are some tailwinds that people are thinking of I guess at this point, we'll just wait until August to hear on some of those. Michael Kaufmann : Yes. I think just some quick comment on that. Remember last year, there was -- we had made earlier comment around 5 60 in the marketplace and then we had decided that it would be -- because of that, we gave a little bit around that. Last year it was different, but that is not our typical and it's not something that we would typically do. We want to stay disciplined to being around our August earnings time. Operator : We'll hear from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Bryan Ross : This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. When you look when you look at the generic landscape, across the buy side and sell side in terms of what you're seeing now versus historical norms, I guess what inning do you think that you're inning getting back to that to normalized generic pricing environment? And are expecting to get back to that over the next year? Or do you think that's further off than that? Michael Kaufmann : Thanks for the question. It's really hard to say. And again, that would be really more around giving guidance, and we just want to stay away from that. For us it's just -- again, just want to keep emphasizing that it continues to be a significant headwind for us in FY '19 for us. And the market dynamics across our various components have remained consistent, but we'll give some more color to your question in August around not only our results for our Q4 but what our thoughts are obviously around that for our fiscal '20. Bryan Ross : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the 4Q guidance. Relating last year, somewhat of an easier comp and factoring in cost optimization and some of the actions you're taking in Medical, what are the puts and takes that give you the confidence in the year-over-year ramp implied by the fiscal year guidance? Jorge Gomez : You're talking about the Medical segment or... Bryan Ross : No. Overall just the 4Q in respect to the -- for the full fiscal year guidance? Michael Kaufmann : I guess it's a couple different components. I know Jorge went through the detail here, but we've got, as you said -- as he said, he's got the ETR benefit we've had so far this year. Now we expect it to be higher in Q4. And we've changed our Medical guidance for the year, so we would obviously have taken down what we expect our Medical segment earnings to be. And then we've mentioned some other opportunities like the Pharma business doing -- obviously, it's going to offset some of that are expense initiatives. So think it just a total of all those when you look at it. We feel like our new guidance is the best indication of where we think will finish for the year. Operator : Next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James. John Ransom : We can look at the generic marketplace just with a handful of public companies and we can look at pricing data, but the analysis sort of stops there. I'm curious, if you were to compare today to say couple of years ago and think about your top 50, 100 drugs, do you see a material decline in the number of suppliers for, say, a generic Lipitor or some of the larger products? Because what we have seen with big public companies is they appear to be abandoning mid-tier products and of course, the public drug stores chains are complaining of lack of generic deflations. So indiscernible] would be that we just have fewer suppliers and I'm just kind of curious to your perspective on that? Michael Kaufmann : Yes. It's an interesting question. I would say that - I would not say that overall, that we're seeing less generic suppliers. There's clearly been a lot of public discussion around some of the larger ones rationalizing their supply chain in their portfolio of products. But at the same time, we're seeing the FDA approve generic drugs at a record pace, we're still seeing suppliers from outside the United States come in both on newer drugs as well as opportunities on the old -- some of the older drugs. And most importantly, whether there's 5 or 10 players, probably doesn't make as much of a difference for us because as long as there is certain amount of competition we're going to be able to go get the cost that we need to from a Red Oak perspective and when we've seen it start to get to maybe fewer suppliers on certain specific items than we wanted, Red Oak has done a nice job of working with companies to either get them back in supply or find ways to get agreements to continue to get the cost. So I wouldn't say that I've seen a material difference in the net overall number of suppliers on items, although you can always pick 1 or 2 items where you might see significant changes. John Ransom : So if that's true, it's not entirely clear, at least to me, where the pressure will be coming from. And certainly you would say there's a lot of stress in the retail channel so you're having to give a little more price concessions downstream because your retail customers need every bit of margin they can find? Or is there something else that we're missing? Michael Kaufmann : So I think that what we've said in the past is that when you look at all of the components, when you take a generic deflation, which we at Cardinal define as sell-side deflation, and you net it against launches, penetration and the ability for Red Oak to go reduce cost on existing items, the net of all that is a net headwind for us for this year and has been for the quarter, and for the year so far. So it's kind of exactly what you're saying is that we're seeing more pressure on the sell side, and we are able to offset that with launches, penetration and cost decreases, and we're seeing margin shrink. Operator : And that will come from Charles -- excuse me, Glenn Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Glen Santangelo : Mike, just to maybe follow-up on the Pharmaceutical segment for a moment. It looks like the headwind that you experienced in 3Q was smaller than what you did in their first and second quarter so the operating profit was probably better than most people on this call were looking for. And so if we hear you clearly, it doesn't sound like it came from the generics program at all. So was there something else within the Pharmaceutical segment that maybe performed a little bit better than what you or we all would have thought? Michael Kaufmann : Well, remember Q3 is the quarter that is always going to be the quarter that has seasonality and the most seasonality and related to brand price increases in the January time frame. And so while those came in roughly about where we expected, I would say for us, the quarter came in about where we expected it to be in Pharmaceutical. So I wouldn't call out any individual item being significantly better or worse than we actually anticipated for the quarter. Glen Santangelo : And then maybe just a follow-up on that. I was just can curious how you may be the conversations are trending with the manufacturers given all the scrutiny around rebates and the HHS proposal and all of that. Are there any sort of initial what-if type acquisitions or is it just sort of business as usual? Michael Kaufmann : Thanks, that's a good question. I would say --it appears what we're hearing from manufacturer. I think we continue to have very open and transparent conversations with manufacturers. We have been -- as contracts expire, we continue to work through the wording to make sure that we are protecting ourselves in the case of sudden changes in WAC prices that might potentially alter our dollar earnings from those manufacturers. The conversations with manufacturers around the fact that if there were any changes around that, we would need to work together because we still need to earn the dollars that we deserve based on the value of the services we provide. And so you take that with constantly talking to them about ways to help them reduce their cost, improve their service levels, provide other services. I would say conversations with manufacturers continue to be fruitful, positive and very transparent about all the various things that we're seeing out there that could impact both of us. Operator : And we'll hear from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Medical. Just -- and I think there was a sterilization plan in February and some articles around that, I think it affected some of the manufacturers. And it sounds like maybe affected you. How much of that is maybe if, is in this when you talk about sort of the internal challenges on fill rates? And Jorge, you talked about still on track in terms of the accretion for the deal in '19. Does that mean when you guys gave sort of the accretion targets for Patient Recovery, you kind of gave numbers not only for '19 but also for fiscal '20. Are the fiscal 20 sort of number still intact here from your mind understanding that we reinvested some of those in the near-term? And then also the $150 million synergy target that you initially laid out. Michael Kaufmann : Yes. I'll take the first part on the issue related to ethylene oxide is what I'm assuming you're talking about there, and then I'll let Jorge talk about accretion part. As far as the ethylene oxide issue, that wouldn't really have had an incredibly minor impact on us for the quarter. Now that being said, it's something we have our eye on. We think it's important. It's used widely across the entire industry to sterilize products, so it's something that is -- would impact everyone in the industry including our competitors and manufacturers. So it's important to the industry on that but for the quarter it was immaterial. And like I said, at this point in time we continue to look at alternatives and make sure that we're prepared in case there are any other changes related to that. Jorge Gomez : Charles, your question about Patient Recovery. So I said before that we are on target this year. We are -- for the disruptions that we experienced in the last quarter or so, we are below what we thought we were going to achieve this year from a -- in terms of the growth from Patient Recovery, but again within the accretion targets. Similar to any other parts of the business at this point we don't want to get into any trends going into '20. We will do that in August, but as of now this is how this quarter is trending. Within the fiscal '19, we are trending below what we thought we would achieve with Patient Recovery this year. Charles Rhyee : But at that time, you did give us fiscal '20 as well. I mean can we think understanding that this year, we're trending below what you initially expected, is it fair to think or are we still thinking from a sequential basis that you would expect things to continue to improve overall? And then just Mike, just to clarify what you are talking about, when you talk about ethylene oxide, that's the stereogenic plant that we're talking about? Michael Kaufmann : That's right. That's the sterilization method that, that plant uses. There are several different types of sterilization methods but that is what that plant is using that I was referring to. Jorge Gomez : And Charles going back to your question about Patient Recovery and going into the future. Obviously, the business case was designed and our expectations continue to be that we will improve the results -- the performance of this business over time especially as the synergies kick in. The synergies are expected to accrue over a few years. And when we think about those synergies at this point right now during this fiscal year we are on track with that trajectory. Operator : We'll hear from Ross Muken with Evercore. Ross Muken : Guys, on the Medical side, is there any incremental thought on sort of the portfolio mix? And maybe as you thought about sort of the longer-term strategy, given some of the volatility you've seen in some of the units and maybe changes in the end market, whether or not sort of you're sort in all the right markets? And secondarily, is there anything else you see on the outside that would be sort of synergistic with it in terms of pivoting in a direction where maybe you've had more success versus some of the areas where pricing and other elements have been more challenging? Michael Kaufmann : Thanks, Ross. I think a couple of things. I do think that when we look at our overall strategy of Medical being really leveraging our historical distribution routes, we having a broad and well-known product portfolio, it's really still the right strategy and important to us. We think that leveraging those 2, like I said, is the right thing and important. We still have work to do, as we've said, around how we continue to modify our comp structure and the way we go to market to drive that. So as we said, we're making the progress we want, but that takes time to change that, and we're continuing to work through that. So from that standpoint, we still feel very good about that. And so there's always opportunities to look at individual products to see if you -- if we need to add or delete from the portfolio. But in general, we feel really good about our portfolio and the overall strategy. Jorge, would you add anything to that? Jorge Gomez : Yes. Ross, just to one of your specific points about certain market and being in the right place, as we indicated a couple of times in the past and even today, part of the work we're doing is looking at our entire global portfolio, looking at geography rationalization opportunities. A few -- a couple of quarters ago, we talked about a few small geographies that we exited, and that is an ongoing work. We will always look at opportunities to improve our footprint. And in some cases, potentially add and in many other cases, exit in geographies and certain product lines in certain places. So that is all part of the ongoing strategic work that John and team are doing. Ross Muken : And maybe just on the corporate side. I mean I -- maybe I missed it, but I don't remember anything on opioid travel-related expenses, it already appears yesterday. All that obviously a big step up for them into next year. I guess where are you in terms of that headwind? And how are you thinking about that in the context maybe of some the cost takeouts that you're doing hopefully offsetting maybe some of that incremental pressure? Jorge Gomez : Yes. So this year, as you may recall, the number that we have included in our Pharmaceutical segment, which by the way we include all the opioid litigation expenses in Pharmaceutical, those are tracking in line with the guidance we provided a couple of quarters ago. So we are probably -- at some point, we said it was like about $80 million including some factories in New York that we ended up unwinding. So we're probably $70 million area plus or take -- plus or minus a few million dollars. And so that is a major headwind for us this year. And obviously, we work really hard to make sure that we offset that with all cost-savings initiatives, but it's trending in line with what we were expecting for this year. Operator : And that last question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Rivka Goldwasser : So two questions here. First of all, if you think about the Pharma segment and we you think about what guidance implies for fourth quarter, it seems that there is still a fairly wide range in your expectations from operating income. And when we look at the numbers, it seems that at high end, you expect operating income to potentially be up year-over-year versus a scenario where operating income is still down. So can you just help us better understand what are the swing factors into fourth quarter? Are you expecting generic to do better? Is there anything that you see that would drive that variability? Jorge Gomez : Yes. Ricky, this is Jorge. The drivers for the fourth quarter are the same drivers that we have experienced throughout the year. So obviously, what happens with our generics programs is an important factor. The Specialty business has been trending above expectations for us throughout the year, has done really, really well, and that is a swing factor as well. I think the type of savings we are able to achieve with our programs -- internal programs, that is another important factor. So there is nothing new that I could point to that is driving the range that you're talking about for Q4. Rivka Goldwasser : Okay. And then when we think about the specialty, because you highlight that -- and you highlight Specialty, strong growth in Specialty now helping you for a few quarters, can you just give us some more -- some context on what's driving Specialty growth. Is it pricing? Is it market share gains, new products? Michael Kaufmann : For the most part, I think the big driver in Specialty is really -- the overall market growth is a big component of it. I mean obviously, we feel very good about our offering and how we our competing in the marketplace and our discipline around cost structure are -- also our upstream services business and continues to grow but I think the biggest factor in Specialty really is strong market growth that we're able to take advantage of. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your CEO, Mike Kaufmann, for any closing remarks. Michael Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see we continue to execute our plans and position Cardinal for future growth, and we really look forward to reporting on our progress with you over the next several months and then particularly, August when we talk about our FY '20. Thanks, and have a great day, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do you thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

During the call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide guidance for fiscal year '20. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. In addition, during the call, we will provide forward-looking guidance for fiscal '20 on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow up so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any questions. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me begin by providing a few thoughts on fiscal '19 before turning it over to Jorge to discuss the financial results for Q4 and for the year. Then I\u2019ll share some perspective on our fiscal '20 outlook and our commitment to future growth. In the last 18 months, we addressed various business challenges and put near and long-term plans in place to grow in the future. Importantly, in fiscal '19, we delivered on the overall commitments that we made at the beginning of the year. Some of our highlights from fiscal '19, including progress against the six strategic priorities we outlined a year ago, are as follows. Notably, we exceeded our initial EPS guidance delivering $5.28 per share. We continued to see double-digit revenue and profit growth in Specialty, Cardinal Health at-Home and Medical Services as we advanced these strategic growth areas. With the recent renewals of CVS Health and Kroger, we now have contracts with our three largest customers for at least the next four years. Regarding our cost structure, we have been engaged in a cost optimization program and the initial work has exceeded our savings targets. We delivered $133 million this year positioning us to make strategic reinvestments and generate significant future savings. For capital deployment, our focus on strong cash flow generation resulted in operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year. We delivered value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks and we improved our financial flexibility while continuing to reinvest in the business. In the portfolio and partnerships area, we took steps as part of our ongoing portfolio management strategy. During the year we rationalized and exited underperforming geographies and finalized the partnership to accelerate the growth for the naviHealth business. With respect to Pharma, we are pleased that our Pharma Distribution business met plan for the year. However, meeting the plan is not enough. We are focused on returning to sustainable, profitable growth. To achieve this, we have works underway across a few key areas that I\u2019ll discuss when I cover our future outlook. Turning to medical, while we improved execution across the segment during the year, we did not meet our expectations. Challenges from Cardinal Health brand products, including cost associated with supply chain infrastructure and commodities, prevented this ongoing work from translating to the bottom line this year. I\u2019ll discuss this in more detail when I talk about fiscal '20. A quick update on Cordis. This business is on a path to profitability with sustained top line growth in many geographies and improving trends for fill rates and back orders. Additionally, we improved fill rates in our Medical Solutions business which includes patient recovery. Overall, we made positive strides in fiscal '19 and we have confidence in our strategic direction and our ability to translate this work into results in the future. To provide some additional color on Q4 and fiscal '19, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jorge. Jorge Gomez : Thanks, Mike, and good morning. I\u2019ll provide a high-level overview of the quarter and a review of the year. As always, our results for both can be found in our press release. For Q4 results, Pharma segment profit performed roughly as expected but medical missed our forecast for the quarter primarily due to a large charge which I will explain in segment segments. Our EPS was once again lower than expected in the quarter due to multiple items that were more favorable than we anticipated. As a result, we delivered a better-than-expected Q4 EPS of $1.11. Turning briefly to the segments. Pharma delivered a strong Q4 with segment profit increasing 7% to $447 million, reflecting the positive impact from Specialty Solutions, a higher contribution from brand sales and mix and the benefits from our cost savings initiatives. This was partially offset by generics program performance and customer contract renewals. Medical segment profit decreased 15% to $97 million, driven primarily by Cardinal Health brand products. Much of this reflects a charge related to an exclusive distribution agreement with the Cordis supplier. This decline was partially offset by the benefits of our cost savings initiatives. Our at-Home, national brand and services business performed in line with our expectations. We continued a strong cash generation in the quarter finishing the year with $2.7 billion in operating cash flow. Additionally, we repaid $1.1 billion of long-term debt reflecting our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Transitioning now to the full year, I\u2019ll provide an overview of the results and a prospective on the commitment we established at the onset of the year. Total company revenue for the year was up 6% to $145.5 billion. Total company gross margin decreased 5% to $6.8 billion and operating earnings were down 9% to $2.4 billion. Fiscal '19 EPS came in at $5.28, a 6% increase versus last year. The full year EPS came in around 22%. This lower than expected rate was driven primarily by the legal entity reorganization work related to Cordis, which we completed in Q1 of fiscal '19 and we discussed on prior calls. For the Pharma segment, as Mike mentioned, we met our expectations for the year. Revenue increased 7% to $129.9 billion due to sales growth from Pharma Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers, partially offset by the divestiture of a China distribution business. Segment profit decreased 8% to $1.8 billion reflecting the negative impact from generics program performance, customer contract renewals and opioid-related expenses. It was partially offset by Specialty Solutions performance, a higher contribution from brand sales and mix and the benefits from cost savings initiatives. Despite several bright spots in businesses such as at-Home and Services, which both delivered all year of strong results, Medical segment performance for the year was below plan. Revenue was flat at $15.6 billion with growth from existing customers offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Segment profit decreased 13% to $576 million driven by the performance of Cardinal Health brand products. This was partially offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Of note, total company SG&A improved 3% versus last year due to dispositions and our cost optimization work. We also improved interest and other expenses 12% versus last year, primarily as a result of the lower debt balance and higher cash balances. Importantly, we demonstrated a strong financial discipline throughout the year from a capital allocation perspective. We increased hurdle rates for capital deployment initiatives and ensured capital was allocated strategically and effectively. This allowed us to return $1.2 billion to shareholders and to strengthen the balance sheet of the company by paying down $1.1 billion of long-term debt. Before I turn it back over to Mike, I\u2019d like to share a few remarks. I am very grateful for the nearly 14 years that I spent at Cardinal Health and I would like to express my gratitude to the investment community as well as to Mike, the full management team, our Board and the rest of my Cardinal Health family, especially the finance team. This is fantastic company with incredible people and an incredible mission. It has been a privilege to work in service of that mission. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you, Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Jorge for his partnership in his numerous roles over the last 14 years. As our CFO, he has been a true thought leader and has set the pace for change. We look forward to continuing the many initiatives that he began. I also want to thank Jon Giacomin who has contributed in countless ways over the last 17 years. His passion for the business, the details and the people propelled him as a leader in pharma and over the last 18 months, he has laid the groundwork that positions med for future success. Both Jorge and Jon led strong teams that will continue to build on their positive momentum going forward. On behalf of the Board and the management team, we wish them both all the best in their new roles. Now, let share some perspectives on our path forward. As you know, we operate in a dynamic industry with significant consolidation, increasing demand, a shifting generics landscape, growth in specialty and the delivery of care moving towards the home. We have and will continue to shape our portfolio, strategies and priorities with these trends in mind. In Pharma, we are focused on fueling continued growth in key areas while also making progress regarding our Pharma Distribution model. Accelerating our growth platforms, like Specialty and our Services businesses are a priority. For instance, we have made targeted investments to develop and grow our medication therapy management, telepharmacy and health messaging services businesses. We like what each of these can do on its own, but working together they can increase connectivity among manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients. Regarding Pharma Distribution, we are testing new downstream models and evaluating upstream strategies. Also, while we expect the rate of brand inflation in fiscal '20 to be similar to fiscal '19, we will continue to transition even more of our buy-side margin to non-contingent contracts. Overall, we remain confident in the long-term future of the Pharmaceutical industry, our role in the supply chain and the strength of our assets and capabilities. Before I leave the Pharma segment, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes here on the opioid epidemic, a significant issue that we care deeply about and one where we do significant work both in our company and in our communities. We have an important but limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, have sophisticated anti-diversion systems and do and have always done extensive reporting to federal, state and local regulators. Even though wholesale distributors do not drive demand for prescription opioids, we have been targeted in lawsuits many with novel and unprecedented legal claims that go well beyond the balance of credibility. We are vigorously defending ourselves against these suits, while at the same time continuing to explore resolution opportunities that make sense for our shareholders. And as always, we will continue our longstanding commitment to making a meaningful difference in communities. In fact, this year marks the 10th anniversary of Generation Rx program, which with more than 100 pharmacy school chapters has reached 1.7 million people around the country with educational and training materials to prevent prescription drug misuse. For over a decade, the Cardinal Health foundation has supported fighting prescription drug misuse and the opioid epidemic in other critical ways as well. We look forward to continuing these efforts as we work alongside others in the industry, government and healthcare to find solutions. Now, turning to the Medical segment, we believe in this business and its role in helping our customers deliver efficient and high-quality care. Our recent history has included some execution challenges in this otherwise attractive market. Med would be a growth engine for us as we successfully execute our initiatives to drive top line growth and improve our cost position. To that end, we are currently engaged in the following. First, we will continue to invest in our growth platforms both at-Home and Medical Services will continue to deliver strong results. Second, we are enhancing our commercial capabilities to improve our offerings and mix. We recently introduced a new sales structure that will enable us to better focus on our customers and make our team more effective. Third, we are making progress on optimizing our infrastructure and our portfolio. Both of these areas are complicated and take time. But we are committed to improving and transforming our manufacturing, supply chain and data capabilities. Overall, the medical team is focused on executing plans that we are confident will drive sustained future growth. As we move forward with multiple initiatives across the company, we remain committed to disciplined capital deployment and continuous cost management. This will enable us to reinvest in key opportunities and in strategic areas close to our core businesses in a way that leverages our operating capabilities. For example, we are empowering leaders to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies to drive cost savings and aligning internal accountability to ensure we deliver results. We are confident that we will generate more than $500 million in savings relative to our fiscal '18 baseline in five years or less. We will continue these initiatives through and beyond fiscal '20 with a balance of urgency and discipline to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. We also remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and to improving our balance sheet. At this time, we expect modest increases to our dividend until we return to the lower end of our target payout ratio of 30% to 35%. Additionally, we intend to further strengthen our balance sheet by paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt in fiscal '20. With this in mind, let me turn to our fiscal '20 outlook on Slide 13. First, we anticipate an EPS range of $4.85 to $5.10. Interest and other expenses should be in the range of $295 million to $315 million. While we may see some fluctuations across quarters due to discrete items, we expect a full year ETR in the range of 24% to 26%. Also, we expect our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year will be 292 million to 297 million shares. As we continue to thoughtfully manage our cost structure and deploy capital, we expect to deliver incremental savings of more than $130 million on top of the $133 million we achieved in fiscal year '19. In connection with these cost savings initiatives, we expect to record restructuring charges in the range of $120 million to $145 million. And we may incur additional charges as we pursue our long-term savings goal. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. As it relates to our fiscal '20 segment outlooks, while we expect mid-single digit revenue growth for the pharma segment we anticipate high-single to low-double digit profit decline due to customer contract renewals, primarily those we previously announced and the continued headwinds of our generics program. Essentially, the full effect of our recent renewals was CVS Health and Kroger will appear in fiscal '20. Additionally, we expect opioid-related litigation expenses to be about $85 million, an increase of about $20 million for the year. As a reminder, we record these expenses in our Pharma segment. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we expect Specialty to continue its trajectory of strong growth. In Medical, we believe our ongoing work to transform key areas of the business will begin to translate into results. We expect low-single digit revenue growth and low-double digit property growth, reflecting a positive contribution from Cardinal brand products. Keep in mind that our fiscal '20 guidance does not include potential uncertainties of changes around the regulatory environment, opioid-related taxes, commodities, tariffs and medical device taxes. Looking forward, we know our success depends on our people. We are committed to attracting and developing world class talent at all levels, and as I wrap up my remarks I\u2019d like to share some updates in this area. As you likely saw in our press release yesterday, our Board of Directors approved two new members. I am delighted to welcome Dean Scarborough, a former Chairman and CEO of Avery Dennison; and John Weiland, former Vice Chairman, President and COO of C.R. Bard. Both bring global management backgrounds and industry-leading expertise to further strengthen our Board with a broad array of skills, experience and viewpoints. We look forward to benefitting from their perspectives. Regarding our senior management team, we are actively engaged in an external search for our next CFO. In the meantime, we have brought on David Evans who will serve as interim CFO as you may have seen in our filing this morning. I\u2019ve known Dave for more than 30 years and he has extensive experience leading finance organizations in large companies including Scotts Miracle-Gro and Battelle. He has been working with Jorge to get up to speed and I appreciate his partnership as we conduct our search. Also, on the topic of senior management, I\u2019m excited to have Steve Mason in his new role as CEO of the Medical segment. With his leadership, we look forward to building on the steady progress underway in this business. Steve has a track record of positive results in every business he has led throughout the company and he will empower the team to drive performance and generate long-term growth. To wrap up, we believe in our team and we are confident that our strategic plans and our near to mid-term objectives will enable a future of growth for Cardinal Health. With that, let\u2019s now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now go onto our first question from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks, guys, and thanks for the questions here. I want to talk about the Medical business here a little bit. Mike, you expressed confidence in this business and you feel like it\u2019s going to deliver value for shareholders. Obviously, it\u2019s been a struggle over the last few years here. And then over the last couple of years, right, some of the issues have kind of shifted to different spots here and there. Can you talk about sort of where you think you are in that process in kind of rightsizing this business here or really kind of identifying the issues? And what kind of gives you sort of the confidence here as we move into the next fiscal year? We\u2019ve identified all of the issues now and we are kind of poised for growth. And I guess secondly, can you kind of remind us \u2013 specify how much of the charge was from Medical and more of the restructuring charges assumed in the guidance is for Medical as well? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Well, I\u2019ll address the restructuring charges real quick. The restructuring charges in the guidance are for the entire company, so that would be any and all of the expected restructurings across Pharma, Med and our functions would be covered by those initial restructuring charges. And as I also said, we may have additional ones as we continue to get after the $500 million number that I said that we would hit. So that\u2019s that piece. As far as my confidence in Med, I think a couple of things. Some of the more complicated things like working through all agreements, getting through the TSAs, a lot of those things that created a lot of the noise in the Medical segment were through those. We also, as you know, don\u2019t plan to do any product acquisitions in the near future in that space or M&A around products in that space so that we can focus on execution. Also I have a ton of confidence in Steve. He\u2019s been a great operator in all of the businesses that he\u2019s run and he\u2019s surrounded by a really good team that Jon Giacomin put in place. And it\u2019s kind of to your point, a lot of the challenges that we have in Medical have been a little bit self inflicted and I feel that with the people that we\u2019ve added, the fact that we\u2019re through a lot of the complicated transitions and we\u2019re focused on execution, that\u2019s why we feel confidence. We have seen good underlying demand in the business and I think that\u2019s kind of the key areas at this point in time. Charles Rhyee : And if I can just follow up from a modeling stand point when we think about the guidance in Medical, should we sort of think about that ramping up through the year or is that something we could see maybe earlier in the year? Maybe from a cadence perspective you can give us a little bit of thoughts around that. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, good question. This year we really expect the Medical guidance for the segment to not be as backend loaded as it has been in the past. We really think we have a more normalized, I would guess, cadence for our quarters for Medical this coming year. And you\u2019re right. You also mentioned earlier, I didn\u2019t get to, is the charge that Jorge talked about. That affected our Cardinal brand products because it was in a Cordis-related charge and obviously we don\u2019t expect that to reoccur at this point in time. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thanks. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi. Good morning. So my first question is on Specialty. It seems to be an important contributor in the quarter. So can you just share with us what\u2019s driving the outsized growth? Is it specific products or customers and how sustainable it is? And also if we think about just the margin in the quarter if you exclude Specialty contribution, would Distribution segment margin and operating margin be up year-over-year? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I\u2019ll give you a couple comments on that. I\u2019m not going to be able to split out the margin component. But we\u2019re really proud of the performance of our Specialty business. Victor and Joe DePinto and the whole team have done a very nice job there and we do expect that business to continue on a trajectory of strong growth. The growth is a lot coming from just our customers growing and new items in the market, growth of the items already in the market, so a lot of it is just positive growth in Specialty overall. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s massive changes in share and those types of things. It\u2019s really just the segment is growing well and we believe that that will continue to happen particularly as it relates to our more downstream customers. And then when I look at our upstream services to Pharma, we continue to see very good progress in growth in those businesses too for us this past year and we\u2019ll continue to look forward to seeing those growing going forward. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then one follow up, Mike, on your opioid comments. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen some press in the last couple of days around potential settlements. So thinking about that and in line with earlier comments about paying down debt, from your standpoint, is it feasible to resolve all the existing and potential litigation in a manner that\u2019s not financially manageable for the company? Mike Kaufmann : Well, there\u2019s a lot to take into consideration there, but at this time it\u2019s so early and we\u2019ve got \u2013 as I commented on opioids where we stand, we feel good about the work that we\u2019ve done historically. We believe that we operate in an outstanding system to manage this. We have always and will continue to report all those things that we feel strongly about, but specifically commenting on any litigation or settlements I don\u2019t think would be appropriate at this time. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We will now move onto our next question from Michael Cherny of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for all the details. Just to go back quickly to the comment you made, Mike, about the charge. Is there any way to just give a size of it or magnitude relative to the impact it had on the quarter? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, that charge itself basically was the difference between our Medical segment hitting our expectations for the quarter and missing expectations. So that is the primary contributor of not delivering on that. And just to give you a little more color, it was a charge related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a Cordis supplier. It was entered in over two years ago. And other than that, it really wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment further on the specific supplier, but we still feel incredibly good about the progress we\u2019re making with Cordis. Michael Cherny : That color is very helpful. Thank you, Mike. And then just one quick question on the Pharma outlook. When you talked about the challenges that you\u2019re seeing in continuation of the generics program, can you maybe parse that out a little bit more? There\u2019s varying data points around the dynamics of the buy-side, sell-side spread. And so as you think about your book of business and the way you\u2019re going to either \u2013 whether it\u2019s potentially try to offset those headwinds or what you\u2019re seeing that you have to wait through especially with your new contracting, maybe just dive in a little bit more into the color around how that\u2019s impacting the Pharma outlook for '20? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. A couple of things. First of all, the largest year-over-year driver for Pharma being down is going to be our customer contract renewals with customers that we\u2019ve already announced, as I mentioned CVS Health and Kroger. So that is our biggest headwind year-over-year for Pharma. Our second headwind is our generics program. It\u2019s a smaller headwind in FY '20 than it was in FY '19, so we like the progress that we\u2019re making. Specifically to give you a little bit of color and I had to give a lot of details because we like to talk about it as one overall program, but I will give you a little color that we are seeing the generics deflation component itself beginning to improve. But when you take a look at the generic launches, the ability for Red Oak to continue to drive cost savings, some of those tailwinds are a little smaller but we are seeing some market dynamics that would tell us that things are beginning to improve. But overall, our generics program continues to be a net headwind for us next year. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question please. Operator : We will now move onto our next question from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, just starting with the $130 million of cost savings, will that primarily be on the Medical side or between the Pharma and Medical side? How do I think about that? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it\u2019s really spread across both segments. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s proportionally higher. It\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t say, a lot different on either side. But our functions obviously are working on things to be more efficient. That will then get pushed into the segments and each one of the segments are working on their components. And I feel good that every single department whether a business unit or functions committed to hitting our target of 130 million of incremental savings this coming year. Lisa Gill : And then just as a follow up, when you talked about the renewals being the biggest headwind, as we think about those contracts over the four-year period of time, do the economics improve over that four-year period of time? Mike Kaufmann : Well, a couple of comments. First of all, there isn\u2019t any like step downs in pricing over the next four years related to those unless there would be some change in the number of stores or some large change or something like that from the customers that wouldn\u2019t be typical. So typically those contracts have a fixed program over the lives of them. So that\u2019s one thing to keep in mind. Other than that, they often improve slightly just because the volumes can go up over time, but typically the rates don\u2019t change much. You may get more dollars to your bottom line based on increased volumes. And we\u2019re excited to be aligned with really excellent customers such as CVS and Kroger who have been historically growing and have really good business models that we\u2019re excited to be partnered with them. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We will now take our next question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess, Mike, just to go back to the Pharma guidance, obviously because it does seem like a pretty big reversal from what you guys saw this quarter, even if I exclude the additional opioid litigation charges that you shared, it still looks like you\u2019re calling for high-single digit declines in profit year-over-year. And if I remember correctly, the comments I thought on the CVS renewal previously were kind of that it was typical structure and nothing different than what you had seen in the past. But today obviously that plus Kroger seems like it\u2019s driving \u2013 if I\u2019m hearing you correctly, it sounds like it driving most of this anticipated decline year-over-year. Could you maybe just share a little bit more around what you\u2019re seeing in those contract structures and pricing even relative to maybe what you\u2019ve seen in the past as far as those renewals have gone? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, a couple of things. I would say that first of all, I still feel very confident that we got very fair and appropriate contract renewals with both of those accounts. Remember that they are contracts that are four years or longer, so they\u2019re a little bit longer than typically the contracts have been. Remember that it also is a full year impact. Essentially we have a full year-over-year impact because as I mentioned specifically to CVS, it was a July 1 start date. So that\u2019s a very important component of thinking about the year-over-year impact. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Robert Jones : Okay, great. And I guess just one other thing you had mentioned I believe you said was not in guidance was any kind of tariff exposure. Is there anything you could share as far as just how we should think about the potential impact, how much of the portfolio is exposed to potential changes or issues with tariffs? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. As you can imagine it\u2019s really hard to predict this, but I will give you a little color in the sense that first of all we do have \u2013 currently in our numbers we do have forecasted some small headwind related to tariffs that are already in place. And so we have already had the opportunity to deal with tariffs this past year. We have done a good job in managing the impact so far and it was a small headwind for us in FY '19. So we\u2019ve build that continued assumption in. What we didn\u2019t build in was what new tariffs may be, because it\u2019s just so hard to predict. And even when you get numbers such as a certain percentage and a certain dollar amount, oftentimes after you get through all the wrangling, the medical products have had a chance to be carved out because of some of the concerns and issues it could create on increased pricing to consumers in the United States. And so we constantly work with our industry to make sure we educate folks on the importance of those products and the cost that it could have on the healthcare system or shortages and other issues. So it\u2019s so hard to predict what that could be. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t have anything build in at this time. But each time something comes up, we will make sure that we try to help give you some color on that and let you know what\u2019s going on those when they happen going forward. Next question. Operator : We will now move to our next question from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. You mentioned quickly that generic deflation was improving. Is that on the sell-side or on the buy-side? Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, when we\u2019re talking about generic deflation for us, we\u2019re always talking about the sell-side because really the buy-side is how Red Oak is doing. We continue to be very confident in the team and the capabilities of Red Oak sourcing the partnership there with CVS Health continues to operate very well. But when I talked about that, what I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019re seeing it improve from a sell-side deflation standpoint. But remember, it\u2019s just one component of our overall generics program and I get hesitant to just focusing on that because you still have to look at what the launches are going to deliver this year or what penetration is going to deliver this year and what you\u2019re going to be able to do from a year-over-year cost savings standpoint. So all-in, or generics program is still looking to be a net headwind for the year. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. And just a quick follow up. Thinking about that $130 million, are you expecting that all to sort of drop to the EBIT line? And should we \u2013 I\u2019m looking at cadence for the year. Medical is so lumpy in fiscal '19. Is there any reason to think cadence for earnings over fiscal '20 should be different than what we saw in fiscal '19? Mike Kaufmann : Well, I think there was to your point some lumpiness in Medical that we don\u2019t expect this next year. We had some bumps remember we talked about in our Q3 around transitioning off of TSAs. This Q4 we had the large charge related into Cardinal branded products. And so with those alone or two pretty lumpy items that occurred during the year, you can also have flu type of things if it comes earlier or late can affect both businesses. So those things \u2013 set aside flu, the other two things we don\u2019t expect to happen this coming year and so we would expect Medical to have a more normal cadence. As far as the $130 million, we will look at that all year long. If we\u2019re tracking ahead in other areas, we see some appropriate investments we want to make into the business for longer-term growth, we may make decisions there. And so that\u2019s something that we will evaluate quarter-to-quarter as we move along obviously with the goal of always delivering on our commitments. But we\u2019re excited to get after the $130 million in our $500 million overall target over the next five years. Next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. I\u2019ll stick with Medical. Mike, when you looked out a year ago, you would have expected that the TSAs could have been bumpy. I don\u2019t know that you would have necessarily expected the charge and then obviously there were service levels and cost reductions. When we look out over the next year and what needs to be accomplished, are there other elements that could be bumpy that you\u2019re looking at? And what in your mind are the two or three items that have to occur in order to meet the expectations you\u2019re laying out here? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, a great question. I don\u2019t know that I see anything out there that at this point in time I would say gives me concern about bumpiness, like the TSAs. And again, I think we\u2019ve done a good work working through a lot of these challenges over the last year. I would say to your second part of the question around what are the things that we have to do well. I would say the first thing that jumps out to me is we\u2019ve just recently restructured our commercial organization and we\u2019re really excited about the increased focus that we\u2019re going to have on our customers and the way that it should free up the time of our sales reps to actually spend time selling. So that\u2019s going to be an important driver somewhat for FY '20 but more importantly to really get the momentum going for beyond FY '20, so that we could become the sales engine on Cardinal Health products and service and quality with our customers overall. So that\u2019d be one of the top ones for me. I think second of all, the team on the operation side of Medical has got a lot of projects that they have on their list today have laid out around both our manufacturing and our distribution supply chain network that are going to be important also for the mid and longer term. We\u2019re going to be making some investments this year to get after our manufacturing efficiency and that again we think are going to pay big benefits for us going forward. So making sure that we execute on the things that help both our manufacturing footprint and our distribution footprint are going to be important components. Eric Percher : Are there any major changes to the supply chain network that have to occur? Mike Kaufmann : Well, some of those things that we\u2019re working on, on our manufacturing and distribution network are going to be things like possibly where we manufacture, what type of automation we have in the plants. We\u2019re looking at our footprint in distribution and potentially relocating and changing some of our footprint to be more efficient in distribution. So yes, there are things like that that need to be done and will be done and we need to make sure that we stay on top of and execute flawlessly. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Muken : Good morning, guys. I guess just getting back to the Pharma business, it\u2019s hard to sort of compare apples-to-apples across the three major distributors, but the other folks obviously sort of highlighted more growth in the business. So I guess it\u2019s not comparable. You guys have some of the opioid charges related in there. But I guess if you think about what happened on the customer side with CVS and Kroger and kind of adjusting for that, I guess do you feel like performance is more like-for-like versus the peers? And I guess as we get through kind of this period and I know we\u2019re only in '20, but I guess after four year or so of kind of declines in that business, do you think we\u2019ll get back to growth after you get through these renewals or is it too early to call that? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I want to be careful not to comment on '21 and forward other than we are absolutely, absolutely committed to growing in the future. It\u2019s something we\u2019re talking about and focused on every single day. And we have a lot of things going on that excite us to be able to grow in the future. It is hard for me to comment on other folks, but let me put it this way. I believe that we are executing very well across our Pharma distribution business. And depending on how you want to adjust things or not adjust things, I feel very confident that we are performing very well compared to our competitors on that standpoint. Keep in mind that we have very different mixes than our competitors. For example, in Specialty, we\u2019re really excited about the growth and execution in our Specialty business but the tailwind that we get from Specialty is smaller just given the size of our respective businesses. But other than that and the timing of our renewals, I feel very good about where we are and how we would compare with anybody. Ross Muken : And maybe just on the capital allocation side maybe just a thought given where the stock is of focusing more on the debt paydown front versus buying back more stock. I guess what\u2019s the thought process of why you\u2019re more biased to sort of shoring up the balance sheet? Mike Kaufmann : Really it goes back to our commitment that we\u2019ve made related to our leverage ratios, we\u2019ve made commitments that we\u2019re going to get those to certain levels over the timeframe. And so from our standpoint we feel that it\u2019s very important to focus on debt paydown in order to live up to the commitments that we\u2019ve made. We also are committed to our dividend, although we plan to continue with very modest increases in our dividend until we get down to closer to the 30% to 35% payout ratios. And as always, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate share repurchases. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve made commitments around our leverage ratio and we want to live up to those commitments. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Valiquette : All right, great. Thanks. Good morning. Just to summarize the overall cost savings initiatives, if you go back a year ago, you mentioned you expected a cost structure savings in excess of 100 million in fiscal '19. You also talked about that zero-based budgeting to deliver greater than 200 million in savings by fiscal '20. So I guess with the 133 million that you got in fiscal '19, 130 million more expected for fiscal '20, is this all tracking in line with what you visualized a year ago or how would you characterize it versus the way you saw a year ago? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I think it\u2019s actually tracking ahead and so we thought we would do 100 million this past year in fiscal '19 and be on a run rate of 200 million. We actually as we said delivered 133 million in '19. We expect to do at least 130 million. So just those two alone would be $263 million, so we\u2019re ahead of where we expected to be which is why I put out the comment that based on this work and based on the change in the way I think our entire team is thinking and looking at expenses and understanding prioritization which is why we put out the target of $500 million over the next five years compared to our fiscal year '18 run rate. Steve Valiquette : Okay. And just a quick one-liner question in the Pharma segment. Do you think operating profit would grow in fiscal '20 if you in isolation just excluded the pricing resets on the customer contract renewals? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I don\u2019t want to get into that level of detail at this point in time. Just to reiterate that the customer contract renewals were the largest year-over-year headwind for us and we\u2019re excited to be locked up for at least four years with our top three customers. Next question. Operator : We will now take our next question from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Katie Tryhane : Hi. This is Katie on for Erin. Can you \u2013 so you\u2019re forecasting I guess low-single digit top line growth for the medical segment. Is this how we should be thinking about that segment longer term? And can you speak to the lay-in synergy opportunities associated with the recent medical acquisition? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : As far as the top line number that\u2019s kind of been historically what that industry has grown in. It has been a flattish to low-single digits growth industry. As we become and have improved our execution, we would expect to continue to see our top line growth be at least at what the industry growth rates are and then a further acceleration to our bottom line as we continue to improve mix and get after our cost. I\u2019m not sure I \u2013 what was your other question exactly, Katie? Katie Tryhane : Are there any other lay-in synergy opportunities associated with recent medical acquisitions that you may see going forward? Mike Kaufmann : Got it. We still believe that our patient recovery business is still on track to get its $150 million of synergies exiting FY '20. And so that has \u2013 as the combination of working with our distribution network and our manufacturing teams, et cetera, sales teams working together, we have continued to have and that has been reflected in all of our thoughts so far. Katie Tryhane : Okay. Thanks. Lisa Capodici : Operator, next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on some of the moving pieces on the Medical side of things. So it seems like you\u2019re guiding Medical EBIT of approximately $70 million. It sounds like this one-time item was somewhere between 50 and 70 based on the variation versus the prior guidance. And I think you were talking about the patient recovery synergies still continuing to ramp throughout the year. So I\u2019m trying to understand ex these moving pieces, it seems like Medical EBIT would be flat to maybe down. I was hoping to understand the moving pieces better. Do I have that right? And if so, when do you think the core can get back to growth? Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, so I can\u2019t comment specifically on the size of those pieces, but I will tell you that \u2013 again that that charge for that exclusive distribution agreement was the largest difference between making our plan and not in Q4. We do expect to see growth across all the various components of Medical next year. And as you remember I had mentioned earlier, we also are making some investments in Medical this year from an expense standpoint in order to set us up for the future as we redo our distribution network and our manufacturing footprint there are going to be some expenses that we will be incurring or investments that we\u2019ll be making that will be some headwind. So you have to net all that together to get to where we are and we feel good about Medical at this point and confident we can deliver on this. Stephen Baxter : Thanks. And then just on the Pharma growth in the quarter, 7% obviously a big swing from where things have been recently. Just for our modeling purposes, could you be able to give any insight into what gross profit did in the Pharma segment in the quarter in terms of growth? Mike Kaufmann : Again, Pharma had a good quarter; lived up to the expectations that we had for them for the year. As far as specifics, I would say the drivers have just been similar to what they have been. The large renewals as I said didn\u2019t essentially start until July, so we didn\u2019t see any of that large customer contract renewal until July 1. We did have a little bit year-over-year from last year. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the drivers a lot different especially with the biggest positive driver, brand mix and increased sales have been kind of the second driver. And then the negative impact of our generics program and contract renewals that most of them already had been announced would be the bigger drivers. Lisa Capodici : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : We will now take our final question from John Ransom of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Ransom : Hi, Mike. Just to kind of pullback from the quarter a little bit, as we think about where you sit in the pharma chain, if you look at the stock price of Teva and Mylan, it would imply nuclear winter and then you look at the margins of the retailers and they go down every year and just look at some of the trading actions in some of the public chains, how do you think about your position when kind of both your upstream and downstream customers are just experiencing what the financial markets would expect to see as just record distress? It just seems like hard for a middle man, if you will, to stay prosperous when both partners upstream and downstream are struggling? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the question. Thanks for ending with such an easy one. First of all, I\u2019d say we\u2019re more than a middle man, I would start with that. Sure that\u2019s maybe the traditional piece of what we do. And I\u2019m actually glad you said it because I think it\u2019s important for us to talk about that. We have a lot of areas that are more than just middle man. When I take a look at our Medical Services businesses, what we\u2019re doing in at-Home, yes, we\u2019re providing supplies but it\u2019s really our unique relationships with insurers and with providers and how we connect them with the patients. And there\u2019s so much more there with other technical business. We continue to see good headwinds or good tailwinds in Specialty. We feel good about our nuclear business going forward. So there\u2019s a lot of other things, but when it comes to the Pharma Distribution business itself, it\u2019s definitely an ecosystem that is in a state of flux. I think all of our customers continue \u2013 luckily we\u2019re aligned I think with very good customers in the sense of CVS, Kroger, Optum. We\u2019re aligned with strong players who have I think excellent game plans for continuing to grow in the future. That\u2019s helpful for us. As we look at the way our retail independents have been resilient and are acting like scrappy entrepreneurs to figure out how to reduce their expenses but at the same time get into other niches, I like the way their responding to all of this. And I think our position in having a broad portfolio with Medical and Pharma positions us well with the Medical or with the downstream providers in the hospital marketplace. So there are a lot of challenges for sure, but I really believe in our position and our capabilities to be able to manage through this. And healthcare is going to continue to grow and stay an important piece. I think it\u2019s why many of us if not all of us stay at companies like Cardinal Health because we know how important it is what we do every day. John Ransom : So on that point, I\u2019m glad you mentioned independents. At a very high level \u2013 you always have market share ebbs and flows, but is your independent customer base just in terms of pharmacies you\u2019re servicing, is it the same higher or lower than it was say five years ago? Mike Kaufmann : Compared to five years ago, we would definitely have more customers and have seen some growth in that business. It\u2019s a group of customers as I said that we just had our retail business conference a couple of weeks ago and I had a chance to be down there and spend time and it was a record conference for us. And we had a couple thousand stores represented. And the buzz amongst the group and the understanding that they need to do things differently and focus on various niches, the frontend of their store, how to drive cost out, they are really looking to us as someone to help them run their business, manage their inventory, help them with things like medication therapy management, mobile technology, those types of things. So we continue to see this business going to continue to be an important customer base for us going forward. So that\u2019s the last question. Lisa Capodici : Yes. Operator : At this time, it appears there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Kaufmann. Mike Kaufmann : I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. We\u2019re really pleased that we delivered in fiscal '19 and we look forward to discussing our '20 progress with you very soon. Take care, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined today by Mike Kaufmann, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Evans, our interim Chief Financial Officer. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. We will provide an update to our FY '20 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP results. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin. And congratulations on your new role. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am here with Dave Evans and I'd like to welcome him to his first call as our interim CFO. Dave has done a great job getting up to speed over the past few months. I'm grateful for his leadership and experience as we conduct our search for a permanent CFO. This morning, we'll cover our progress and our path forward. I'll start with a few high-level thoughts on the quarter and then Dave will cover the financials. I'll close with some thoughts on how we will build on the solid start to the year. We remain confident in our strategic direction as we focus on driving both efficiency and growth. Our Q1 performance validates our short-term progress and longer-term path. At the enterprise-level, our disciplined cost management is enabling strategic reinvestment across both segments as well as in critical, functional areas. In the Pharma segment, we're seeing early signs of positive trends. And although we still have work to do, we are making progress in key areas. In Medical, we're encouraged by early traction from our improvement efforts, as well as the initial returns from ongoing investments in our growth platforms. I'll share more about this work in both segments later in my remarks. But, first, I'll turn to Dave to walk you through our results and specific milestones we achieved in Q1. David Evans : Thanks, Mike. And thanks everyone for being with us today. I'm pleased to join you on my first call. I'll walk through the numbers and highlight a few actions taken in Q1 to demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth. Overall, I'm happy to report that we delivered earnings of $1.27 per share in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. Total company revenue increased 6% versus last year to $37.3 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased 1% from last year to about $1.7 billion. The decline gross margin rate principally reflects year-over-year Pharma distribution contract renewals and products and distribution mix. SG&A, which includes variable distribution related expenses, improved 2% despite higher revenue. This improvement reflects sustained organization-wide efforts to streamline our cost structure. Mike might elaborate more on some of these efforts in a few minutes, but I'd like to say that just in the few months that I've been here, I've already seen this effort evolve from a cost reduction initiative to a broader cultural mindset of efficiency and improvement. Total operating earnings were $577 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by performance in the Medical segment. Interest and other expenses were roughly flat versus prior year at $80 million. This reflects a decline in interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. This compares to last year's rate of 14%, which was impacted by changes to our international legal entity structure. Average diluted shares outstanding were $297 million, about $9 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to opportunistically buy back $359 million of stock. We tired 80% of these shares in Q1 and expect to complete the program in our second quarter. Combining share repurchases, we returned well over $400 million to shareholders in the first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to look to deploying capital on a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly way. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash for the quarter was a use of $653 million. As a reminder, timing, in particular, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, affects point in time cash flows. This dynamic negatively impacted our year-over-year cash flow for Q1, but will reverse in Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which includes about $700 million held outside the US. So, I'll now transition to segment results, starting with Pharma. Revenue increased 6% to $33 billion, driven by sales growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit decreased 3% to $398 million, which reflects the impact from Pharma distribution customer contract renewals. This was partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and performance in our Specialty Solutions business. As a reminder, we record opioid related litigation expenses in the Pharma segment. Before I leave Pharma, I want to note that our generics program performed roughly as expected. While we continue to see improvements in the market dynamics for generics, I would remind you that several variables impact the net performance of our generics program, including sourcing, volume, new item launches and sell side pricing. Overall, we're seeing positive trends and good progress in the Pharma segment. Mike will discuss our ongoing efforts to maintain this momentum. Transitioning to Medical, segment revenue for Q1 increased 3% to about $4 billion. This was due to organic growth across the segment led by products and distribution as well as in Cardinal Health at Home, one of our strategic growth areas. This growth was partially offset by the divestiture of naviHealth in August 2018. Segment profit increased 26% to $170 million. This reflects benefits from our cost savings initiatives, as well as growth in products and distribution services and Cardinal Health at Home. As with revenue, these benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the naviHealth business. To provide some additional clarity, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products, as well as costs from our global supply chain.  Our work across the Medical segment to integrate our infrastructure, streamline our footprint and improve the customer experience is progressing as planned. Mike will discuss how this work will transition into growth over the longer term. Moving now to our full-year outlook, with one quarter's worth of results behind us, we've increased confidence in our full-year guidance. At the same time, we continue to monitor external factors and key assumptions that could impact our forecast. We also continue to track the timing and evolution of internal investment initiatives. Examples of external factors could be headwinds, which include tariffs and medical device tax. Examples of key assumptions we closely monitor include brand inflation and our generics program. Considering the potential fluctuation of these and other items, we are reaffirming our guidance along with our corporate and segment assumptions. While we generally don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that, directionally, we expect operating earnings in Q2 to be modestly lower than Q1. So, before I turn it back over to Mike, I'd like to mention a significant item included in our GAAP results. In connection with a recent opioid-related settlement with Cuyahoga and Summit counties and the agreement in principle amongst the parties involved to a global settlement framework, we accrued $5.1 billion after-tax in the first quarter. We believe this global settlement framework will serve as the basis for definitive settlement terms and documentation. And for this reason, from a legal and accounting perspective, this accrual is prudent. For Cardinal Health, the cash component of the settlement framework is up to $5.6 billion over 18 years. If factors change, we'll adjust the accrual appropriately. Let me now turn it back over to Mike to provide further remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Dave. This settlement with the two Ohio counties enables the discussions around the global settlement framework to proceed. The global framework, which is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, is designed to resolve all pending and potential opioid lawsuits by states and political subdivisions. Importantly, with the commitment of both funds and the distribution of treatment medications, this framework provides an immediate solution to the communities and families that need it most. As you know, we have an important, but limited role, in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We take that role and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. We remain committed to being part of the solution to this epidemic and that is why we are committed to the global framework and continue to be actively involved in its progression. With that said, if this framework is not successful, we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves. Shifting now to our strategic direction in the focus areas I mentioned last quarter. I said on our last call that, in Pharma, we're focused on two things \u2013 further enhancing our core distribution business and fueling sustained growth in key areas. Regarding our core distribution business, we are focused on continuously enhancing the customer experience, improving pricing and contract discipline, and reducing costs. We are making significant investments throughout the segment with a longer-term view of the business. For example, we're implementing digital technologies that will improve visibility and enhance our pricing capabilities. In addition, we recently began a program to improve our e-commerce capabilities and enhance the experience for our customers. Beyond investing in our core businesses, we are focused on investing to drive growth in rapidly-evolving spaces in healthcare and identifying ways to further differentiate ourselves and shape the future. For example, in Specialty, we recently made a multi-million dollar investment to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee with a state-of-the-art, cold chain complex including deep frozen technology. This new facility will enable us to combine two existing distribution centers, streamline technologies to drive operational efficiencies and support continued growth in rapidly evolving areas of the Specialty industry. We're also investing in our higher margin services businesses, which we call our connected care offering, to build greater connectivity between manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients. We will continue to purposely redeploy capital in these and other areas that align to our strategy. Moving on the Medical, we are building out our commercial and operational capabilities across the segment and continuing investment in key areas. Dave shared some of these activities, which include enhancing our commercial approach, streamlining our supply chain, and rationalizing our footprint, are showing early signs of success. Commercially, we are more closely aligning ourselves with the needs of our customers and incentivizing our sales force to sell Cardinal brand products. We expect these enhancements to be complete by Q3 and their benefit will begin to materialize in FY 2021. As part of our supply chain work, we are reconfiguring our North American network. For example, in California, we are consolidating two of our distribution centers into a modern flagship center, which will enhance customer experience at a lower cost to serve and position the segment for growth. Additionally, with respect to our global supply chain, we more than doubled our manufacturing footprint with the patient recovery acquisition. We are already leveraging some synergies, but we see a path to capture significantly more. To that end, within the next quarter, we will finalize plans to reduce cost and deliver industry-leading service across our global network. These plans will take some time to execute. So, we have a strong governance structure in place and are committed to diligently managing our costs to realize the greatest long-term benefit. As in Pharma, we're making significant investments across the Medical segment to improve the customer experience and drive growth in both the products and services spaces. For example, as Patient Care shifts more toward the home, we continue to capture growth opportunities through Cardinal Health at Home solutions. We are committed to further developing this business and are redeploying some of our cost savings benefits in this area to improve the customer, healthcare professional and patient experiences. In Medical services, another business unit in the segment with sustained growth and strong results, we're building additional digital and data capabilities, modernizing our operating systems and streamlining clinical and operational workflows. This will reduce costs for both us and for our customers and, importantly, will improve patient safety. We recognize the components of the work across our products and services spaces will take time to translate into sustained growth and results. We remain committed to fueling this momentum. On the enterprise level, as Dave and I shared earlier, our cost savings initiatives are producing tangible benefits across the company. We expect to meet or exceed our $130 million commitment for the year, primarily through SG&A-related activities. Our initiatives to improve gross margin, like those in Medical to right-size our manufacturing and distribution footprint, will contribute more significantly to our five-year, $500 million savings goal as they will ramp up over the next few years. With these initiatives, leaders across the company are evaluating internal operating models and identifying opportunities to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies that not only drive efficiencies and contribute to our savings goals, but to improve insights. One example is our recent partnership with Genpact, a global professional services firm focused on digital business transformation, who will help us transform our finance operating model. As part of this partnership, Genpact will create a data analytics and FP&A hub here in Central Ohio to drive industry-leading innovation. About 200 current Cardinal Health FP&A and data analytics employees are transitioning to the Genpact hub next week, alongside a team of Genpact's process, finance and data analytics experts. This is just one of the many initiatives across the company to streamline our processes, leverage our scale and enhance our data capabilities. We will share additional updates on these initiatives as they develop. As we drive these type of efficiencies across the company, we will fuel growth through balanced capital allocation. This includes reinvesting in the business, returning cash to shareholders and improving our financial flexibility, while maintaining our investment grade status. We remain committed to paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt this fiscal year, which includes the $450 million of debt maturing in Q2. To close, in Q1, we generated positive momentum across the company. We are pleased with this start to the year and recognize that there is more work ahead. We have a strong foundation of scale and industry knowledge. With our talented and dedicated employees, we're committed to building on this foundation to adapt, innovate and lead as our industry evolves. With that, I'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I guess, can you help me square two things here. You talked about the early signs of positive trends that you're seeing in the Pharmaceutical business, but I kind of want to square that with the guide where it seems like operating earnings deceleration is going to continue through the balance of the year. So, I guess, could you put a little more color on the positive trends that you're seeing and kind of help me square that with the guide for operatings growth or actually operating kind of deterioration in the segment? Mike Kaufmann : Go ahead. I'll let Dave start. David Evans : George. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way we're thinking about this is, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. I'll start with that. It certainly gives us increased confidence in the full year. At the same time, I'd say we're very cautious and that we're only one quarter into the year. So, we've got some pretty significant assumptions out there that are still left open \u2013 for example, brand inflation \u2013 and there's also a lot of other key kind of environmental assumptions that we're making that could change. So, our view is, at this early stage in the year, there's just no reason to be changing our full year guidance. We'll certainly be in a much better position to do that after our next quarter earnings call. George Hill : Okay, that's super helpful. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up is, did we see a full quarter of the CVS repricing this quarter? And is there any way to call out the impact of that? David Evans : We did see the full quarter. And we have not provided any specificity in terms of the annual impact of that contract renewal. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. George Hill : Okay. Helpful, thank you. Kevin Moran : Operator, next question please. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now take the next question from Glen Santangelo of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Glen Santangelo : Oh, yeah. Thanks and good morning. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the strength in the Medical business. In the past few years, you talked about the challenging market conditions, some of the supply chain issues. It sounds like this quarter, the company did a great job on the cost side. But what else has changed to help drive that performance, so we can maybe think about the sustainability of the results, you posted this quarter? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thanks for the question. I feel really good about the Med segment. They performed a little better than we expected in Q1 and really happy with the transition of Steve Mason in his role. He's done an excellent job of getting up to speed so far and really surrounded himself with a solid team. SG&A clearly was a component of our performance in the quarter. But there are multiple areas where we are working through various performance improvement. For one example, service levels now are not only back to where they were at the acquisition of patient recovery products, but are actually better than at any time while we've held the business. So, we've made a lot of progress in service levels. We're making solid progress on both SG&A and items that will really drive COGS. And we're in different innings on each one of those, but really happy so far with what we saw in the first quarter of Medical. Glen Santangelo : Thanks. Maybe I just have one follow-up for Dave. Dave, you maintained the guidance for the full year, but you called out specifically that the operating profit in 2Q would be lower than Q1. Could you maybe just help us think about some of the assumptions in that sequential second quarter or some of the seasonal items that are maybe driving that outlook in 2Q? Thanks. David Evans : Yeah, absolutely. So, I'd say \u2013 first of all, we said modestly lower. And we think about that, we think about a variety of factors that could change from quarter to quarter. One, for example, would be our SG&A spend. We've got a large inventory of investment opportunities to drive long-term improvements, and those are ramping up. And so, the level of the spend, the pace of that spend, we expect to increase in our second quarter. Further, we've talked about the CVS and the Kroger's contract renewal being effective July 1st, we do have other contract renewals in much smaller scale, but yet other contract renewals will be occurring in the second quarter and throughout the year. And finally, I would also say that we have some customers that have experienced difficulty either through bankruptcy or other financial distress where we're expecting some modestly lower volume in the second quarter than the first quarter. And as that volume declines, we'll capture our fair share of that, but we'll only capture our fair share of that is our current assumption. So, there's a lot more depth in that, but I'd say those are some of the headlines that give us some reason to believe that Q2 won't be just simply a mirror image of Q1. Glen Santangelo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. My question is related to the opioid comments. When we think about that $5.6 billion that you're now reserving, if that ends up being the final number and within that 18-year timeframe, would that have any impact on the business, the core business? And if so, do you have \u2013 what degree of freedom do you have to offset that with additional streamlining initiatives? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thanks for the question. It broke up a little bit, Ricky. So, if I don't quite get the answer right, feel free to follow-up on that, particularly. I can't provide a lot of details on it. But, first of all, the settlement is spread over 18 years. And so, that's important to know. We continue to believe that that settlement is something that will be a consideration as we look at capital deployment, but not a limitation as to when we look at capital employment or investments. We do believe that the overall settlement framework is something that is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general and it does provide a framework by which hopefully we can continue to not only get this behind us, but also get meaningful funds to the people that need it, begin looking at the distribution of the free goods that are out there and also look at other ways that the industry can work together to improve the overall monitoring of opioids. So, I'll stop right there and see if I was able to answer your question or not. Ricky Goldwasser : No, you did. Thank you, Mike. Let me just have a quick follow-up, or maybe not so quick. But when we think about the long-term financial profile. Obviously, in the quarter, revenue up mid-single digits and profit were down because of the renewals that you talked about and we'll see throughout the year. But when we step back and we think about the industry on a steady state in your assets, and once you normalize for the renewals and taking into account all the streamlining and efficiencies that you talked about in your prepared comments, what type of operating profit growth do you think the business can support long-term with a mid-single-digit type top line growth? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's too early for us to give any real comments on 2021 and beyond. I would just say that we feel really good about the progress that we made this quarter, both in investing in the growth areas that we've talked about, Specialty at Home and our services businesses, but also getting after our cost structure. I think Dave made a comment that's really important, is this isn't just a cost reduction, this is taking entire cost structures out in a way that they won't come back, that the culture and the way the leadership is working is really driving at prioritizing and focusing us on the right things, so we're spending dollars in the right space, taking advantage of digital technologies, robotic automation, AI, et cetera, in order to really drive our cost structure down. So, we feel really good about achieving our overall $500 million number, our $130 million number for this year and really have this built into our overall culture. But, again, it's just too early for us to make comments on 2021 and beyond, but we feel that we are not only getting after our cost structure, but investing for growth, which is really important. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : With Cowen. Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the questions, Mike. Just one going back to the opioids real quickly. Your comments \u2013 and one of your peers today sounds a lot more positive, I would say, maybe than the comments from many other companies the other week. Anything kind of change in the last week or two that kind of increased the sort of the optimism here in terms of getting towards a global settlement here? Mike Kaufmann : Wouldn't say anything changed. Let me just step back and make sure that we're on the same page. As you know, a few weeks ago, we settled with two Ohio counties, which, by doing that, enabled us to move forward with this framework. That was an important component of being able to get that behind this, so all of the parties involved in the global framework could move forward and begin working on. So, that's an important thing to know. We clearly have a global settlement framework and structure with the $18 billion over 18 years with our component being $5.56 billion. We've also agreed upon distributing the free treatment medications for 10 years and we've agreed that, when we get this behind us, we can all work together to look at the way state, federal government, distributors, everybody work together to monitor opioid shipments and uses, so that we can work together. We think the desire and \u2013 if we can get this behind us, how we'll bring meaningful relief in both funds and distribution of treatment medication to the people that need it is important, and so we feel positive that folks will work hard on this to get this going. So, again, nothing specific, but our belief is that the way this is structured that this is the right accounting for us at this point in time. Charles Rhyee : And if I could just follow-up, obviously, if you look at the number of plaintiffs \u2013 I forget the last count. It's upwards of 2,000 or so. Obviously, the states are a big component of it, but you have a lot of smaller plaintiffs. As I read some of the comments from AmeriSys as well as who speaks to it, it kind of suggests that not only state AGs, but also a lot of the other plaintiffs. Can you kind of discuss like the participation of the smaller entities in this? In other words, if you get this framework done, do we still have a long tail of small plaintiffs kind of coming after the players here? Or is it kind of \u2013 this is structured in a way, would you think, that this will achieve [indiscernible] looking forward? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, good question. I would say this. You could probably put them in many, many buckets. Well, let me put them in three broad buckets. There's state, there's the political subdivisions, the counties, the cities and then this will become more private plaintiffs, which might be pension funds or individuals and those things. This global framework is put together to settle on the first two, all of the state claims as well as the cities and all the political subdivisions. And the accrual that we put on the books is to represent the global framework we did for those first two buckets. That third bucket, which there is also still suits out there, are very different and it's a mixture of different things and those are still out there and will be things that we will have to address going forward. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, Mike and Dave. So, kind of following up a little bit on that last question. One of your peers had some very different language in their press release this morning about when they make accruals and when they don't. But without getting too much into that, I guess, the question is, is there any possibility that Cardinal's further along or closer to a settlement agreement than some of your distributor peers? Is there any scenario where Cardinal may reach a global settlement, but your peers may not? Or is it kind of all three year or none around the global settlement? Just curious to get your extra thoughts on that. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thanks for the question. No, I would say that Cardinal is not doing anything different. This is just our understanding and belief of the way the global framework is set up that we believe the accounting that we've done is appropriate for the circumstances in our \u2013 on that. Steven Valiquette : And one of your peers talked about a settlement maybe still being months away and that seemed to be different than what some investors were thinking. To me, I think that's still a pretty short time horizon given the number of parties involved, but is there any extra color on when do you think the timing could be nailed down on a settlement? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, it's really hard to actually predict timing, but it's not something that we think is going to get done tomorrow. There is work to be done. And as I mentioned, we believe settling the two counties, getting that behind us and allowing the state AGs to begin the process of working with the political subdivisions, plaintiffs, attorneys, et cetera, that that process has begun and we're fully supportive and we'll do what we can to help in that process. And it will take some amount of time, but it's really hard to predict what that will be. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : We will take our next question from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike. As we think about the global settlement, how do I think about it from a tax perspective? I'm just trying to figure out what the impact will be to cash flow. You talked about the fact that there'll be some impact, but really shouldn't change how you think about capital deployment? So, that would just be my first question, was how do we think about the tax implications. David Evans : Yeah, Lisa. This is Dave. Thanks for the question. Look, the intent of this is consistent with the public policy and guidelines of the IRS and the state tax authorities to make this tax deductible. Having said that, the details and specifics of this agreement really just aren't there right now, to provide the level of precision that, ultimately, we'll have, nor is the complete clarity of the tax code there at this stage. So, from an accounting perspective, we just followed accounting guidance and established what we believe is an appropriate reserve for what will be tax deductible. But that, I would say, will continue to become more clear as time marches on and the specifics of both the tax code and the settlement offer become more clear. Mike Kaufmann : And as far as the cash flow impact goes, Lisa, as you said, while it's spread over 18 years specifically, how it will be paid and funded each year is still being worked out. So, it's hard for us to give you any real color on the exact timing and impact of cash flows. But as you can imagine, we spread it out over time in order to be able to still manage our business effectively going forward. Lisa Gill : And then, Mike, if I could just sneak one in on policy. Thoughts around re-importation and the potential impact that that could have to Cardinal and drug distribution in general? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, it's an interesting question. It's one of those things that it's probably a little too early to get into a lot of detail. This is something that I can remember working on 15 years ago when we thought it was going to be imminent and working on setting up all of the capabilities internally to help make sure that, if it did happen, there would be a safe supply chain. And I think the focus on re-importation has to be on patient safety. And I think that Cardinal was as well-positioned as anybody that, if this were to get some legs, that we would be able to work with folks to help make sure that any re-importation was done on a safe basis. It's hard to imagine that it could be material in any way to affect our businesses, but if it did happen, I think Cardinal was well-positioned to help any of the folks that would do that. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great, thanks for the questions. Mike, I just want to go back to some comments from the prepared remarks around the financial distress of certain customers. I guess, first, I'm assuming that's some retail independents, but wanted to confirm that. And then, could you talk a little bit about what you think is driving this? Was it kind of a one-off related to a certain pocket of customers or is there anything more systemic you're seeing in the marketplace around the health of some of your maybe perhaps smaller customers? Mike Kaufmann : No, those comments were not meant \u2013 so I'm really glad you asked, were not meant to talk about the small customers. This was really about the bankruptcy of Fred's and the continuing restructuring of the Kmart account \u2013 two accounts that we've had that we've been managing over time that were both generic buyers of ours. And as those volumes declined due to their financial situation, that has had some impact on us. But that's really what we were referring to in those comments. Robert Jones : Got it. Got it. No, thanks for the clarification. And, I guess, just one follow up on the Medical guidance, you guys mentioned that you're monitoring the med device tax and tariffs as it relates to guidance. And, clearly, the guidance would imply a deceleration over the course of the year. So, I just wanted to maybe get a better sense of what maybe the guidance looks like if in fact those items don't, in fact, come to fruition. And just one point related to Medical. I wanted to make sure I was thinking about this right. I believe you're lapping a fairly meaningful headwind from a supplier charge in 4Q. Wanted to confirm that that was right as we just think about the cadence around the Medical guide for the rest of the year. David Evans : Yeah, Bob. That's absolutely correct in terms of the second half of your statement. We will be lapping in the fourth quarter a reasonable charge that should be non-recurring.  With respect to the balance of the year, we have not built in \u2013 as we said last quarter with the full-year guidance, we've built in nothing with respect to the med device tax. So, if it doesn't come to fruition, then that's consistent with the guidance we provided. And, clearly, if it does, then that's going to be a headwind we're going to have to manage through. Tariffs are just such a dynamic topic that we've done our best to offset the tariffs that are in effect now. But that, again, is changing. So, I'd say if that would completely cease any further dialog around tariffs, then what's been announced today, we've more or less been able to manage through that. What I would say is there are still a lot of other SG&A initiatives that Mike talked about that do have a longer runway and, therefore, they aren't necessarily all \u2013 the cadence isn't equally distributed amongst four quarters.  I'd really highlight some of the supply chain initiatives that have a long runway and won't necessarily bear fruit for \u2013 it could be two, three years, but we are incurring costs to begin to plan for those this year. And as well, the sales force restructuring that we've discussed as well is kind of in-flight through the course of the year. So, that's not something you can just kind of ratably divide it by four and say it's going to be equal in terms of the cost or the benefits. So, look, you're right in that the fourth quarter does have a tailwind this year and the fact that this is non-recurrence of a charge, but we just \u2013 we feel, I guess, I'd say, cautiously optimistic for the year based on the first quarter, but feels too early at this stage, given all these variables that are out there to call anything up at this early stage. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Dolph Warburton : Hi, this is Dolph on for Eric. Question about the in kind portion of the potential settlement. If we take $1 billion of value, is that $1 billion of revenue? And if so, are you able to determine kind of the costs? Or, I guess, the better question is, what does an in-kind service really look like for Cardinal? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, it's a great question. That would be an area that is still looking to be defined yet, but, essentially, they're one of the folks that's settling in the case, is contributing free goods is the essential idea here. And the thought is that the three distributors would agree to distribute those free goods to the people that need it. None of the actual cost of distributing those free goods, because we don't have enough information on that, are included in our overall accrual. That being said, we at this time don't think that would be material, but don't have enough information to know. But the concept is just being able to take those drugs and then using the efficiency of our overall supply chain of the distributors to get those to the folks that need them most. Dolph Warburton : Great, thank you. And then, just a follow-up. The difference between the charge listed in the text of the release and what's listed as an add back pre-tax, it looks like about $40 million. I assume that's legal services in the quarter? Or is there something else causing the difference? Mike Kaufmann : No, the breakdown\u2026 David Evans : We've got two components. The primary two components. Of course, our pro rata share of $18 billion and then there's the pro rata share of the two Ohio county settlements. The remaining small difference relates to \u2013 I believe we may have spoken in the past about, which is in our med supply business, our Cordis business, the IVS product, which we continue to accrue for a loss, continue to see on that as well. It's a fairly small number, but that \u2013 if you get to the third decimal digit, that's where you're going to find, is the IVS\u2026 Mike Kaufmann : Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will take our next question from Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the opioid discussion. Really appreciate all the color and insight you've provided thus far. I wanted to come back to the outlook for share repurchase. So, if we were to treat the settlement like debt, this settlement would point to trailing leverage approaching 4.5 times. So, it sounds like you're saying that the settlement framework, as currently proposed, would not be a limitation on capital deployment. So, I'm hoping you can help us square your comfort level with this implied leverage. How you think the debt rating agencies are going to look at this issue and the importance of maintaining an investment grade rate to the company? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. First of all, I would say that \u2013 I wouldn't say that \u2013 remember, this is a consideration. So, we don't see it necessarily as a limitation, but, clearly, once we understand the flows of the cash over the 18-year period, we're going to have to take that in consideration in all of our capital deployment pieces. But let me turn it over to Dave to give you a little color on our thoughts around the rating agencies and what we could talk about. David Evans : Look, first of all, we've got good relationships with the rating agencies and we stay in close contact with them. So, it's continuous dialog.  Second, our investment grade credit rating is very important to us. So, it's something that we value and we'll continue to monitor and manage \u2013 to maintain that.  Let's say, when you look at the leverage, the numbers that you're citing, a couple of factors. One, recall, this year, we've committed externally to de-levering by at least $1 billion. So, as we look forward on this, that number will be coming down. And second of all, I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to speculate on the credit rating agencies or opine on where they're going to land, but I think there's multiple scenarios between saying this is zero liability or it's the book accounting accrual liability. For example, you could look at \u2013 it's just a discount in future cash flow of all the future years' payments, which nets you a number that's quite a bit smaller than the headline $5.6 billion. So, we'll see how the credit rating agencies opine on this, where they land. But at this point, I'd say we'll be focused on this. We will make a substantial bite of the apple this year and we'll continue to monitor this in the broader scheme of our capital allocation policy in the years ahead. Stephen Baxter : Great, thanks. One quick follow-up. Just given how you started out the year on cash flow, can your remind us what you're expecting for the full year for operating cash flow, or at least some directional context relative for the past couple of years? Thanks. David Evans : Yeah. Look, we have not provided cash flow guidance in the past and we didn't provide it this year. So, I'm not going to speak to that. It's just \u2013 I'd say, if you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are not structurally different than last year. We continue to work on our working capital efficiency initiatives. We continue to drive strong cash flow. You will see anomalies based on a point in time, but I wouldn't say we expect anything materially different year-over-year without providing a finer point to it in terms of giving you any specific guidance. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from John Ransom from Raymond James. John Ransom : Hey, good morning. Just going back to the stuff we used to talk about a lot, Mike. I know you've probably answered this question 18,000 times over your career. But it's interesting to us what's happening with the generic cycle, in that the pricing at a manufacturer level has certainly firmed. So, we calculate deflation having dropped from the high teens to something like the mid-single digits, whereas at the pharmacy level reimbursement pressure just continues. So, you're seeing an accelerated squeeze at the Pharmacy. So, I just wonder you guys being a student of the pharmacy and you're already talking about Fred's and Kmart, how long can this go on without just continued chaos in the independent pharmacy channel? Mike Kaufmann : Well, that's a tough question to really talk about. So, I'll give you a little bit of color. A few things come to mind. I'll talk about it from both sides. First of all, I think our \u2013 all of our customers are \u2013 are there a few one-offs like a Fred's and a Kmart? Yeah. But as we look, our retail independents, in general, have stayed at roughly the same number over several years now. They continue to find not only ways to work through the reimbursement challenges, but to continue to find other ways to compete in the marketplace, whether it be through packaging, through additional services, through front end, through just the high quality service that they give every day. And I think the chains continue to do the same through automation and other programs themselves. So, I think that the chains, including the independents, all of the retail pharmacies, continue to be an important component of getting pharmaceuticals to patients. And so, it's something we're always going to keep our eyes on, but I think they've learned how to compete in this marketplace. As far as on our side, we have seen some improvement as we said in the market dynamics around the sell side pricing side. Remember, our generics program is made up of four components and we've always said it's sell side, buy side, launches and overall volumes with our customers. Because of some of the customers we've mentioned, we've seen a little bit of weakness on the volume side than we expected. And the new item launches, as you know, are always highly fluctuating and can change. That's been a little less than we expected so far this year. And all that netting together, our generics program came in about as expected.. John Ransom : Okay. And just switching gears. A philosophical question. We're all kind of scratching our heads about how to treat this settlement. But if this is going to \u2013 if it's an 18-year settlement and it's just an annual cash outlay, why would that be added back to adjusted earnings? It's not something like amortization, it's non-cash or it's not a one-year one-time. Isn't this just best thought of as a reduction in adjusted earnings for almost 20 years? Why would we add this back? David Evans : So, the way I'd answer that is, this isn't going to be a charge to the P&L over 18 years. It's a cash cost. But from a GAAP accounting P&L expense perspective, the charge is recognized initially once and that was what you saw recorded this quarter. And so, recognizing a 18-year charge, we did call out as a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment, appropriately so. So, I think we might be mixing and matching cash and expense charges. Does that answer your question? John Ransom : I mean, if I could just push back on that, it seems like we want to have it both ways in terms of \u2013 if it's helpful, we add it back. Yeah, I get, you can take the charge year one, but it's going to be a reduction of what I would call cash earnings. And so, yeah, add back amortization, that's not cash. I get that. Or a one-time. But this is an actual reduction. So, it just seems like we're having it both ways to take this big accounting charge, but then add it back to adjusted earnings. So, yeah, the mismatch, seems like we're a little bit having it both ways. That's all. David Evans : Yeah, I understand your question. I think what I \u2013 look, when we make GAAP, non-GAAP adjustments, that's for when we have an expense or a credit in the current period P&L that we add back or subtract out to get to non-GAAP. In the case of this opioid accrual, we won't have a P&L charge in future periods. So, there won't be anything to add back to get to non-GAAP earnings. Now, I suppose \u2013 I think you will look at this from a cash perspective and certainly everyone can model the cash flow impact for the next 18 years, but that's separate from \u2013 it just won't really be in the equation in terms of a GAAP versus non-GAAP adjustment because it won't be a charge in future P&Ls. So, it won't be anything to add back . Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thanks. Good morning. All of my snazzy questions have been asked already, but I have a couple of technical ones. I think it was Bob that asked about the medical device tax. You admitted it's not in guidance. It could come back. What would be the actual impact or best estimate of the impact if it does come back in dollar terms? Secondarily, commodity cost inputs and FX in the Medical segment. I'm curious if you can give us some sense of the impact those had on profit in Medical. Thank you so much. David Evans : Yeah. So, first, with respect to the medical device tax, we don't have complete clarity on this. So, I don't have a precise answer for you. But I would say that, on an annualized basis, we believe it could be in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis. Okay? So, if we look at for \u2013 if it's effective in January, the second half of the year, you'd pro rate that. Again, I'll just kind of caution that that's based on a lack of perfect clarity and information. And so, if that were to actually happen, we'd be prepared to provide a more precise answer to that at that stage. The second question was related to FX. Look, we have FX that shows up in different areas of our P&L. We have some that's showing up in the segments. And then, you may have noticed in interest and other, we have other changed a bit, and that's principally driven by FX. I would say that, on a net basis, FX in the first quarter was reasonably neutral, was not a material driver positive or negative. I think the team is doing an excellent job in managing this and navigating through this as appropriate. Eric Coldwell : And the commodity costs? David Evans : Oh, I'm sorry commodity costs. Eric Coldwell : [indiscernible] pointed that out yesterday, yeah. David Evans : Yeah, I know. I apologize. So, commodities, for us, in the first quarter, I'd describe them as a small headwind. They were a headwind, but not in a material way. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for getting me in, guys. So, my question on the opioids is just how much confidence do you have \u2013 that $18 billion over 18 years \u2013 that this will be the final layout between the level 3 \u2013 or the tier 3 groupings that you mentioned earlier, that this is really going to be the final number for the MDL and for everybody else and that you can really put this to bed with this kind of settlement? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thanks for the question, Kevin. Look, it's still too early to tell. As I said, this global framework does only impact the first two buckets. There is no accrual or ability to even estimate and understand the size of the last bucket that we talked about. But as far as the global framework, we have to separate both the accounting and the likelihood of this getting done in our mind and this framework is something that we support. We like that it's being supported by a bipartisan group of AGs and it's something that we're behind, but it's still too early to tell you whether or not it will be successful. But we do think not only is it something that we can support, and it has the support of them, but it's something that's important to the people that need it most because it will get dollars, free drugs and some potentially new processes out there that I think all benefit the country. Kevin Caliendo : Sure. And just one quick follow-up, when are out visiting you guys, you talked about a restructuring of the Medical sales force compensation. Did that impact 3Q in any way? And how are you thinking about the impact of what the incentive program for sales force might have or have had on Medical going forward? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, that's something \u2013 it's one of the really key things going on in Medical that Steve and the team are leading. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this restructure is a component of not only compensation and sales incentives, but also around how we go to market to best address selling to the customers they want \u2013 to our customers, the way they want to be sold to. So, we did a lot of work out talking to and understanding the way our customer base would like us to come to them and how they would like to be serviced. And so, this restructuring was highly defined by a lot of detailed work. We started to \u2013 we put it in place in our Q1. And as far as incentives go, changing the jobs, interviewing folks for roles, both internally and deciding that, in some roles, we needed to go externally for the right level of talent the way we want to work and we would expect that that entire restructuring will be done and behind us by the end of our Q3 and that we would start to see benefits from that next year in FY 2021. So, we're really excited about it and like the progress we're making. Kevin Moran : So, next question. Operator : There are no further questions. So, I'd like to hand back to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. We're really pleased to be off to a solid start to our FY 2020 and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. Take care, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran. Please go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss Cardinal Health\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 results. I am Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations and joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Evans, our interim Chief Financial Officer. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR Section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. During the discussion today, our comments including an update to our FY 2020 outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can try and get everyone an opportunity to ask a question.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our Q2 performance and our outlook for the year, I would like to reiterate a few things we shared last Thursday regarding voluntary recalls for any level three surgical gowns and certain free source packs containing those affected gowns. The full press release and additional information regarding this issue can be found on our website. First and foremost, we apologize to our customers and their patients. We understand the gravity of this situation and are dedicated to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. We are engaging third-party experts to conduct a comprehensive review of our quality assurance processes and business practices and we are committed to executing corrective and preventative actions. As we shared last week, related to these recalls, we recorded a $96 million charge in our Q2 GAAP results. This charge represents our best estimate of costs for the recalls, including inventory write-offs, as well as certain remediation and supply disruption costs such as cost to replace recalled products. To provide some clarity, $56 million of this is within cost of products sold and $40 million is within SG&A. This charge and any future adjustments made to it will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health leadership team, I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and tireless effort. All of us, myself included, are focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible for our customers and their patients. I\u2019ll now turn the call over today to walk through our Q2 results and updated fiscal 2020 outlook. And then I\u2019ll share some thoughts on our path forward. Dave Evans : Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start with an overview of our performance for the second fiscal quarter and then provide an update to our fiscal 2020 guidance. In Q2, we delivered earnings of $1.52 per share, an increase of 18% from the prior year. This result exceeded our expectations and was driven by a combination of operating and non-operating activities which I will elaborate on the comments to follow. Total company revenue increased 5% versus last year to $39.7 billion and consolidated gross margin increased 2% from last year to $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 3% to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by higher costs to support sales growth and by fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These items were partially offset by the benefits of enterprise wide cost savings measures. The net result for the quarter with consolidated operating earnings of $646 million, a 1% increase from the prior year. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense decreased 48% to $51 million. This was primarily driven by the change in value of deferred compensation plan investments and lower interest expense as we continue to execute our de-leveraging plans. Of note, in the quarter, we paid down more than $700 million of long-term debt and have now paid down nearly $800 million through the first half. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% nearly four percentage points lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in jurisdictional mix. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million about 6 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we completed $350 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q1. We repurchased 7.3 million shares over the first two quarters and an average value of $48 per share. We now have $943 million remaining under our Board authorized share repurchase program. Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $700 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which included $788 million held outside the U.S. As a reminder, timing, in particularly the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point in time cash flows. Moving on the segment results starting with Pharma. We were encouraged to see positive momentum across many areas of the segment. Segment revenue increased 6% to $35.7 billion, driven by growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit increased 4% to $462 million, with our generics program being the largest driver. As a reminder, what we refer to our \u2013 as our generics program includes sourcing, sell-side pricing, volume, and new item launches. For the first time in several quarters, our generics program reverted from a net earnings headwind to tailwind. At the same time, we continued to see strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business. Brand sales and mix also positively contribute as we manage changing dynamics to capture the value we create through our supply chain. These tailwinds were partially offset by Pharma Distribution customer contract renewals. Transitioning to Medical, revenue for the segment was flat to prior year at $4 billion. Growth in Cardinal Health at-Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution. As a reminder, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products. Overall, Cardinal Health brand volumes have lagged our expectations through the first half. While we recognize we still have progress to make. This validates the importance of our commercial initiatives which Mike will discuss in his remarks. Medical segment profit increased 4% to $195 million. This reflects the benefits of ongoing initiatives to improve our cost structure including work to optimize freight and IT relationships. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in products and distribution. Medical segment profits are now up 13% compared to fiscal 2019 on a year-to-date basis. Moving now to our full year outlook. With half the year behind us, we\u2019re raising our full year fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to the range of $5.20 to $5.40 from the prior range of $4.85 to $5.10. I\u2019ll call out a few items contributing to this increase. First, we now have additional clarity regarding external factors we mentioned last quarter that affect the enterprise, including brand inflation, the medical device tax and tariffs. Also based on the sustained improved trends in our generics program, we now expect the Pharma segment to exceed our original expectations for the full year. A few additional items to note in the Pharma segment as we look to the second half of the year. First, from a year-over-year comparison perspective, recall that it was in Q4 of last year when we started to see an improvement in the generic market dynamics that means we\u2019ll be comping more challenging performance in Q4 of this year. Second, we now expect opioid-related legal cost to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million for the year with the majority of the year-over-year increase occurring in the back half of the year. As a reminder, these expenses are recorded in our Pharma segment. Third, on brand inflation. While the January price increases from our contingent vendors fell within the range of our expectations, they continue to be a smaller dollar contribution each year. And in Medical, I\u2019ll remind you of the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 related to quarters. This will affect our year-over-year growth rates in the second half for the segment. Regarding the rest of our corporate assumptions, we now anticipate FY 2020 interest and other income and expense in the range of $260 million to $280 million. This improvement is largely due to the favorability we\u2019ve seen thus far with our deferred compensation plan investments and the benefits of debt deleveraging that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we plan to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares to be in the range of 293 million to 296 million for the full fiscal year. Given that we are halfway through the year, we\u2019ve decided to narrow this range. Regarding our segment assumptions, we are making one update. With the favorability I discussed, we now expect Pharmaceutical segment profit to decline low single digits. This is a significant improvement from our original expectation of a low double digit decline. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Dave. As we look to the remainder of this year and the next few, we will continue to focus on enhancing our established core businesses and on fueling sustained growth in evolving areas including Specialty and at-Home. In Pharma, let me start by saying we continue to be actively involved in ongoing negotiations of the terms for a global settlement and we remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic. Overall, we have increased confidence in our work to drive growth across the Pharma segment. Our investments in our generic pricing and analytics capabilities as well as continued strong performance from Red Oak and improving market dynamics are enabling our generics program to now be a tailwind for the year rather than a headwind as we previously expected. Also, our investments in both our Specialty and Connected Care businesses enable us to capture value in the ever changing healthcare landscape. Moving to Medical. I mentioned last quarter that we had multiple initiatives in flight to enhance our commercial approach and streamline our supply chain. Our work in these areas continues. However, with the recent recalls, we are currently deploying our Medical segment teams to meet the most immediate needs of our customers and their patients. While we recognize this will slow momentum in our commercial and supply chain initiatives, we remain confident in the underlying strategies of these work streams, and we are dedicated to their success. We will provide an update on our next call. At the enterprise level, we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and modestly growing our dividends. Opportunistically, we will continue to explore share repurchases and M&A. Across the company, we continue to prudently manage our cost structure. We\u2019re doing this through focusing our resources, improving our processes, and embracing new technologies that create better visibility and velocity throughout the company. Our goal is to be easier to do business with. As this new mindset takes root, we will continue to see a sustainable behavioral shift and ongoing value creation for years to come. With that, I\u2019ll now pause to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Glen Santangelo : Yes, thanks and good morning. Just a quick question regarding the guidance in the Medical segment. I\u2019m kind of curious, does the recall have any implications for the outlook in the second half of the year? Because if you look through the first six months, your operating profit is already up double digits and Dave, as you sort of alluded to you have that easy comp coming in the fourth quarter from that charge last year. So by maintaining the guidance there, it kind of implies that, the operating performance would be pretty weak in the second half. And I\u2019m just kind of curious if I\u2019m looking at that correctly or if there\u2019s anything else there? Dave Evans : Yes, Glen. This is Dave. Good question. So we \u2013 as you could see, we collected the direct costs and include those in our charge of $96 million. What we have uncertainty on, and frankly at this very early stage is, implications to second half in terms of revenue margin in any disruptions with our customers. So I would say that you\u2019ve read this fairly well and that we\u2019ve reflected some of that uncertainty in the guidance that we\u2019re providing for the second half for Med. Glen Santangelo : Okay. And then maybe if I could just ask a quick follow-up to Mike with respect to opioids, I think you were sort of forecasting about $85 million of expenses and now you\u2019ve taken your opioid litigation expenses up to a $100 million to $125 million. The framework\u2019s been out there for a few months. It kind of sounds like you\u2019re confident. Why the increased sort of litigation expense now? Hopefully, we\u2019ll winding the stack. Could you maybe give us an update on the timeline of maybe what we should be expecting from here? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the question. We are still dedicated to the framework and progress does continue. So that\u2019s a positive. But as you can imagine, these are incredibly complicated arrangements. We have to work through with 50 different states that we\u2019re working with. And so to get this over the goal line, there is a lot of work that\u2019s going to be done over the next several weeks and months to get that done. And even when it\u2019s agreed to, it\u2019s got to get papered. And then we\u2019ve got to work through implementation of the various components of it. And so when you begin to look at all of those costs and the way the spend, we believe, will ramp up. We believe that \u2013 you\u2019re right, the costs are going to go from $85 million was our original to $100 million to $125 million with a significant portion ramping up in the Q3 and even probably a little more in Q4. Next question, please. Operator : We will go to our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Yes. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to stick with that topic, Mike, because obviously it\u2019s so important to Cardinal and to the group. One of your peers talked about narrowing conversations around a potential opioid settlement. You obviously sound incrementally, more positive that this is progressing. Could you maybe just give a little bit more on how many other states, maybe not specifically, but are more states and local governments and municipalities engaging at this point. I think the original framework that we had all seen obviously highlighted just four state AGs and I\u2019m just curious specifically, are you seeing more people coming to the other side of the table? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks again for the question on this important topic. As I said, we remain committed to this framework and we\u2019re very appreciative of the four AGs that took the initial lead on this. They have been working with all 50 states. We continue to get the feedback from those states and look to the various components of the details of the agreement. But it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me right now to try to tell you or handicap how many states are in or out. But I will tell you that the four AGs that we talked to continue to make progress and I think we all believe that this is the right thing to do for the companies and for the country to help get some relief to the people that need it, with not only the dollars we\u2019re talking about, which are important, but equally the other components which are distributing the free goods and working with them on programs to improve the overall monitoring of the opioids. Robert Jones : No, no, I appreciate that, Mike. And I guess just to go back to this generic program dynamic, you highlighted it\u2019s the first time in several quarters, it went from a headwind to a tailwind. You guys talked specifically about four components that I guess comprise your generic program. Could you maybe just dive a little deeper into what exactly changed to flip the generics from a headwind to a tailwind in the quarter? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I think a couple of things. I think first of all by far this is the item that drove the difference in our expectations for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, pretty much everything else was right there where we expected to be. Maybe a little bit better, but this was the big driver. And it\u2019s really good performance across all of the components. We\u2019re very happy with Red Oak. They continue to perform at a very high level, not only in getting after cost for us, but also just doing an excellent job on service level. We really believe we have industry-leading service levels, and that really helps lead to maintaining and growing our volumes, which is an important part of it. So while volumes were a little lighter than we had expected originally this year, due to the situation, as we mentioned, with Fred\u2019s that went bankrupt and some other customers that are winding down a few stores, we are still seeing volume growth. And then the other big factor is going to be just market dynamics. We\u2019ve seen significant improvement in the overall market dynamics on the pricing side. So when you put all of the components together \u2013 and we had a strong quarter on launches. It was really strength across all of the components that made the program over perform. Dave Evans : Yes, just \u2013 I think, Mike, you hit out at the end there. I think we did have an earlier-than-expected launch of some new items. That was helpful for the quarter. In addition, we had a fairly favorable mix that help drive the results we saw in the second quarter. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : We will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning, and congrats on a very good quarter. Mike, going back to your comments on market dynamics and just improved on pricing, digging a little bit deeper into that. When we think about the pricing, are you seeing improved pricing on the sell side versus the buy side? And focusing on the buy side, China is an important source of generic API supply. Given what we\u2019re seeing there with the coronavirus, how does that impact supply \u2013 overall global supply in the marketplace? And what could be the potential implications on potential return to generic inflation? And is any of that in your second half outlook? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I\u2019ll start with \u2013 as far as the second half outlook goes, we basically are just taking the trends that we\u2019ve seen for the first half of the year around generics, the overall programs and kind of forecasting those out for the rest of the year. We\u2019re not projecting necessarily any improvements or inflation or anything like that. It\u2019s just really about being more confident that what we\u2019re seeing \u2013 now that we have roughly eight months of activity versus five last quarter, which just felt a little too early to call it, we feel like we\u2019ve had enough activity here that we feel good about increasing our guidance related to that. And that is clearly the biggest item. As far as some color on it, I think the important thing is, it\u2019s hard to really get focused on just the buy side or just the sell side because they work in tandem, and it\u2019s really about driving margin per unit. And what we\u2019re seeing is a much better balance between what\u2019s happening on the sell side in terms of the amount of inflation being less than historical, but also being able to then balance any decreases there with good performance at Red Oak. So that we can continue to manage our margin per unit in a way to be able to have the overall program grow. And as Dave said, the units and the overall launches helped to that, too. And so that\u2019s really how we look at it. As far as the China API, you can imagine, this is something that we monitor. Red Oak is in charge of that for us, and they do a great job of understanding where raw materials are coming from, where they\u2019re manufactured. And you\u2019re right, there are a decent amount of API manufactured over in China and some of the affected areas. We have \u2013 where we have \u2013 we\u2019ve worked with manufacturers to try to increase supplies ahead of this. I do think it\u2019s something that, based on the amount of supply and the supply chain, is something the industry should be able to work through. But it\u2019s hard to say how long this will last, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on, and we will. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : We will go to our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Hi, thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, you called out Specialty as being a growth area again in the quarter. Can you just remind us the size of that business and the capabilities versus some of your peers? And then as we think about the potential for IPI and potential changes around reimbursement, can you talk about your thoughts on that? And any impact that you could see in your Specialty business? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Specialty business, the last number that we publicly gave for FY 2019 is that we finished around $19 billion in sales, and so that\u2019s where that business is. We continue to expect that business to have significant growth this year across all of its areas. It\u2019s sales into the actual downstream providers in the acute space as well as upstream services to manufacture. So we are seeing good momentum across all three areas in that business and continue to feel good about not only their quality of service to the customers, but some of the investments we\u2019re making in the businesses that we\u2019ll be able to talk about more here in the future, including a recent investment we\u2019ve made in [indiscernible] that was announced that we believe will also be an area of helping in the cell and gene area. So we continue to be excited about the specialty area. As far as it relates to IPI, I would say this; first of all, we\u2019re in favor of anything that can help reduce the cost of healthcare to the U.S. healthcare system. We know that\u2019s important. We hope and look to folks to be able to find ways to reduce costs for folks. So that\u2019s important to us. The second thing I would say is that when you think about IPI or any of these programs as folks are looking at, the impact to us, I think, is generally where it could impact us in the first order is, does it change list prices, does it mean that the way that manufacturers establish list prices, do they have to lower them, do they have to reduce their price increases? Those are the types of first order of kind of magnitude impact us that we look at. And as you and others have heard me say, I think that we as a company and as an industry have really worked well over the years in the fee-for-service model to first of all, make anything that\u2019s \u2013 the part that\u2019s dependent on deflate or inflation to be less than 5% of our overall margin rate, so that helps protect us from any impact or what folks might do with inflation rates. And secondly, the way we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate our ability to renegotiate DSAs over time as WAC prices fluctuate that we still feel very confident that any impact to list prices that we can manage through very effectively as a company and as an industry. The piece that\u2019s really important to us though is the impact to our customers. We really look at any of this legislation with the true lens to our customers and the impact on them, and we want to make sure and have commented on past legislation that\u2019s been out there that we have to be really careful that type of legislation doesn\u2019t reduce access or reduce the ability of our customers and theirselves to be able to work with the actual patients to provide the type of care that we know that they deserve. Lisa Gill : Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike and Dave, I\u2019d ask you guys a little bit more about the generics program contribution in the quarter. And I guess, what I\u2019m looking at is, you guys and your friends in Texas kind of highlighted big beat \u2013 you demonstrated big beats in earnings this quarter that were generics related, don\u2019t seem repeatable either in the next quarter and the balance of your fiscal years. So maybe could you provide a little bit more color on the earlier than expected launch of the new items that was highlighted and maybe the contribution in the quarter? And maybe some more commentary around what was delivered in the quarter that might seem more one-time versus what might seem repeatable on a go forward basis? I know that\u2019s a lot. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes George, let me answer that. Look, when we talk about the four elements of what we described as a generic dynamic, those are continuation of trends that we would expect to see in Q3 and in Q4. So we expect to see year-over-year some healthy improvement in Q3. Q4 we don\u2019t expect to see the same year-over-year improvement because Q4 of last year if you go back and look at that, was a quarter \u2013 was the first quarter where we began to see the inflection this deflationary trend. And so we have a much more challenging comp in Q4. With respect to the accelerated launch of new items, that\u2019s not necessarily a one timer it\u2019s just a pull forward of something that was anticipated later in the year. So I think you can expect, which is why we called our guidance up specific to pharma, we expect to see some positive results in Q3. And then possibly today based on what we see somewhat moderation in the year-over-year comparison in Q4. Does that help answer your question, George? George Hill : Yes, I think, you covered it clearly. Thank you. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi good morning guys. I wish if you could talk a little bit more about some of the specialty profit drivers in the quarter and maybe more broadly beyond that is it sort of an increase in services? Is this the launch calendar? Any additional color you can provide on that would be helpful. Mike Kaufmann : I think in specialty a lot of this just has to do with the normal growth of specialty. We\u2019re continuing to see certain drugs grow in the marketplace because of their success, particularly in the oncology space, getting new indications and just normal growth. That\u2019s a really big piece of it. Part of it is some of the uptake of some of the biosimilars here and there some of that, while they don\u2019t provide a lot more value than normal branded items and they generally act like that. There are some smaller opportunities on the earning side that earn a slightly better there that\u2019s been a piece of it. We\u2019ve seen really nice growth in our services business upstream with wins in our 3PL business, and our hub and some of our other businesses have continued to grow. So nothing unique about like large pieces of movement of business or anything. One-timers like that it\u2019s just nice solid growth with the volumes across the board. Elizabeth Anderson : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Mike Kaufmann : Next question. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hey, thanks for the question. So based on how you size the relative components of the Pharma guidance coming into the year, it seemed like renewals are driving at least half of the high single digit to low double digit profit decline you\u2019re assuming. I assume the renewal impact hasn\u2019t changed, so the revised guidance for the low single digit percent decline would seem to indicate a decent amount of underlying growth excluding the renewals and the opioid expenses, which have now moved higher too. So just wanted to check and see whether you agree with that logic or anything has changed about the sizing of the renewals throughout the year? And therefore, whether we should be expecting segment profits to return to growth on a reported basis as we move into next year? Thanks. Dave Evans : Steven is Dave. So I\u2019d say your assumptions are all pretty spot on. I would say though that we\u2019re really per usual practice. We\u2019re not in a position to comment on 2021 at this early date. But overall, I think, you\u2019ve got a good hand on. And I understand what we\u2019ve been articulating. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. Does your guidance assume any meaningful contribution from biosimilars? Do you continue to view that as sort of an opportunity for you longer term? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, our guidance would assume any of the normal type related stuff for that. But there is nothing new \u2013 no new launches that created the increase related to biosimilars. We continue to think that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep an eye on. I don\u2019t believe it will be a big driver for us in the short term because right now they act more like branded drugs and their overall margin rates are similar. There\u2019s a little bit of opportunity to make a little bit more money on some of the biosimilars, depending on programs we might be able to put in place with customers. But I would not call them a large driver of anything over \u2013 over this year over the short term. But something that we\u2019ll keep our eye on is something to be more of a midterm or longer term driver, particularly if they become interchangeable. And then I think for sure my opinion would change on their ability to be a much bigger driver for us. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then where are you in terms of the streamlining of your commercial and supply chain initiatives on the medical side of the business? You suggested that maybe you face a little bit of a setback here in terms of the recent recalls, but would you say you\u2019re still seeing some progress and focused on that front? And also if you could break out the recent quarter\u2019s trends specifically, that\u2019d be helpful. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, on Cordis, I\u2019ll just handle that real quick. Nothing really to report on Cordis outside of what our expectations are, the business is continuing to grow, we\u2019re seeing growth in our profit there and we continue to be really happy with what the team is doing there to meet or slightly exceed the expectations that we have for that business this year. But we don\u2019t see it being a driver outside of what we expected for the year one way or the other. As far as the initiatives in medical, we remain incredibly committed to both of them. There is nothing about the underlying strategies of our commercial realignment or our supply chain initiatives that at this time, I would say, make me feel any differently than we have been talking about. But as I noted particularly well then both of them, but probably a little bit even more in the commercial side. It has been slowed with the gallons recall. We have deployed some of our sales reps, as well as other people into the field to be actually located at the hospital locations, helping them manage through this challenge that is out there. And it\u2019s really important to us that we take care of our customers and our patients. So because of that it would slow down where we expect to be. So we have said and committed that our supply chain we would be \u2013 have a plan done by the end of Q2. That plan was done, but as we look at implementation of that plan we are taking into account this disruption that we\u2019re working on and just overall re-evaluating and make sure we look at the overall global supply chain to make sure there\u2019s no changes we would make based on some of the recent challenges. And then again on the commercial piece, we\u2019re on track to get the jobs hired and all that, but we do have folks deployed to customers. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Cherny with BofA Securities. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for all the details so far. So as you think about the opportunity, you said you have \u2013 you\u2019ve highlighted Specialty as a growth opportunity. Obviously you\u2019re performing well so far in areas of medical. How do you think about that against the backdrop of capital deployment? How do you think about areas where you think your customers are asking for you to do more? And as you \u2013 versus previous capital deployment and M&A opportunities, are there any other components or pieces of the business that you think is makes sense to beef up right now? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, as I mentioned, we still feel really good about having several areas that we would consider our strategic growth areas. I would highlight four of them, Specialty being one of them. At home we\u2019ve talked about our connected care services business and pharma and our medical services businesses. These are all businesses we\u2019re seeing significant growth on the top line and on the bottom line. There are also businesses that are really right on trend, care moving towards the Home and the various things that go along with Specialty and the service businesses. So these are areas where we are prioritizing our capital expenditures to those areas so we can really focus on organic growth. And if there are M&A opportunities out there that would make sense, those would be the areas that you would see us focus on. Now that being said, we\u2019re going to continue to do all the right things in our core businesses to make sure we maintain and grow those. But for, what I would say, extra allocation of capital, those are going to be key areas that we\u2019re going to focus our capital expenditures on. Kevin Moran : Yes Michael if I can add, so really, I\u2019d say we\u2019re focusing as well on partnerships in a way that probably more so than we have in the past. And when we do think about our internal capital, we\u2019re really thinking about it in four different categories. You get our maintenance capital where clearly you\u2019ve wrote initiatives like our supply chain, we\u2019re focusing on deploying capital to cost out type of projects, we\u2019re providing capital in areas where we need capacity for growth. But then we are also deploying some capital to explore new growth areas. So it\u2019s a pretty balanced approach, disciplined approach to getting a return on our CapEx. Michael Cherny : Okay, thanks. Kevin Moran : Thanks Michael. Next question. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just to follow-up a little bit out of Specialty two things I want just done real quick. First, I was a little bit surprised about the biosimilar because there actually had been a bunch of biosimilar [indiscernible] dollars of the physician channel. But that was not really a driver [indiscernible] just changes the price experience with either customers or suppliers and separating specialty pricing from traditional brand pricing, whether that may have played a role in some of the better Pharma Distribution segment result. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. I think I picked them up. There was a little spotty on being able to hear, but I think I got all your pieces. So let me see if I can walk through them all. From a change in price standpoint, I\u2019ll look at it \u2013 we\u2019ve been very disciplined over several years in our pharma distribution business to make sure that we\u2019re splitting out our pricing on our Specialty so that it is priced differently than normal brand, so that we don\u2019t \u2013 so we can make a fair return on the specialty drugs and we\u2019ve continued that discipline with any new business or renewals with either, as I\u2019ve said before, specific pricing in that area to maintain appropriate profitability or some types of mix type of penalties in agreements to make sure that if their mix goes the wrong way, that the overall cost of goods adjust. So we continue to be very focused on that in the PD area. And also in the overall specialty business since there\u2019s very little generics in that space that is priced on a more individual drug standpoint. And again we remain very disciplined in that area to be careful. So I wouldn\u2019t say that pricing changes is either a \u2013 is a driver of our growth in specialty, but it\u2019s also not something that we\u2019re ignoring or I would say is a headwind from that standpoint. As far as growth in specialty overall, I would say it really comes from market growth. The market itself is growing significantly with new indications, new drug launches that the. Your question on biosimilars, to think about biosimilars, the way to think about it is when a biosimilar launches, you\u2019re either \u2013 you\u2019re not necessarily getting new volume to speak of because it either you\u2019re replacing of current branded drug with a biosimilar. So overall your volume doesn\u2019t generally go up because of a biosimilar it\u2019s just an opportunity to potentially be able to have some market movement capabilities to have customers prefer one over the other. And those are where we can make a little bit of extra dollars when we work with our downstream customers to prefer either the brand or the biosimilar. But from an overall perspective of drivers, at this point in time, I would not say that that is a significant driver, but I think it over time will get to be a more and more potential driver for specialty. Next question, please. Operator : We\u2019ll go to our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. James Auh : Hey, it\u2019s James on for Charles. Can you give us a quick update on our cost savings program, maybe how much of the $130 million of incremental savings expected this year has been achieved? Is it tracking in line with expectations? And perhaps how much of that\u2019s been reinvested opposed to dropping to the bottom line? Dave Evans : Yes James thanks for the question. We\u2019re making great progress against that program and we\u2019re still on track to achieve the $500 million target as previously communicated. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019re on track to realize the $130 million or more this fiscal year. So we\u2019re making good progress. We\u2019ve got a pipeline, as you can imagine, we\u2019re tracking all sorts of opportunities and working through kind of stages of maturation. And we\u2019re seeing with strong confidence now our ability to attain the entire $500 million. So we\u2019re really continuing to focus more on not just simply cost out, but how do we try to drive improved value speed throughout the organization, increase our capabilities with the belief that that will continue to drive more savings throughout the future. With respect to the level of reinvestment we are continually encouraging our organization to press \u2013 Mike and I, with lots of difficult choices and challenges to reinvest this with high returning projects. I can\u2019t quantify for you the exact amount of that, but we\u2019re encouraged that we are seeing more and more opportunities as we build this culture within the organization of encouraging people to seek out new opportunities for ongoing cost improvements, growth drivers, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the program is one that we should deem as a real success. James Auh : Okay and just another technical question in the share count guidance, does that include any additional share repo beyond the $350 million from the ASR? Mike Kaufmann : No. James, that assumes that we completed the $350 million, and there will be no further purchases for this fiscal year contemplated in that guidance. James Auh : Okay, great. Thank you. Kevin Moran : Thanks for the questions. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I\u2019d like to return to the Medical recall. I recognize you\u2019re still working through the potential impact going forward. But could you provide us some context for how surgical gowns and kits fit into medical broadly, maybe starting with market share, where your customers are turning and impact on other elements of the business? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I won\u2019t obviously be able to give a lot of detail on market share, but I can give you a little color is that there \u2013 the reason why this is such a \u2013 has a large impact, is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. use kits. There\u2019s several different folks that compete in that space, but we do compete very effectively. We think with market leading type of quality and services tied to those kits, the ability to design and price those kits appropriately, et cetera. So the idea here is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. do use kits and because gowns are in almost every kit. Even though when you look at this as an overall relatively small percentage of gowns sold across the U.S. because they\u2019re in kits that\u2019s why it\u2019s having a more \u2013 a larger impact than you might expect. And so I\u2019ll just stop there and see what your follow-up question is, might be on that, just to make sure I\u2019m hitting the right things for you. Eric Percher : So I think concerns from the hospital purchasers around impact on utilization and impacts on their business. You started with an apology and are taking that head on. But what is your take on the ability to remedy this and any impact on the business from what this has done to relationships here? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I think any time you have a challenge in any business, it\u2019s often the way you respond, that makes the difference. And I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with how our Medical team from the leader, Steve, all the way down to people into the distribution centers have responded, taking accountability and ownership for this and said, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make the customers\u2019 life as good as we can, knowing the circumstances. So we\u2019ve deployed hundreds of people we\u2019ve taken out, not only our Medical segment, but the Pharma team and Corporate Functions have also volunteered and sent people, even to the Vice President level, out to the field to pack kits pull things together for customers at their locations to make \u2013 to do the best we can. And so I believe that the way we\u2019re responding to this is really, really important. And I think that our feedback so far from the majority of customers is they understand things like this can happen, but they respect and appreciate the way we\u2019re responding.  It\u2019s hard to say how this ultimately \u2013 as Dave said, we don\u2019t know how this could affect our business going forward. And we\u2019re hoping that it doesn\u2019t. But we know that we have created some pain, and the most important thing to us is that our customers know that we are focused on them first and foremost so that they can treat the patients that they take care of that. But we\u2019re also taking a lot of other specific actions, too. It\u2019s not only deploying people into the field to make things better, but it is also about increasing production of similar or replacement products. For instance, we\u2019re offering our more protective level 4 gowns to help bridge the supply gap. We\u2019ve ramped up production because we do source these gown in multiple locations. And so we\u2019re ramping up sourcing elsewhere. We\u2019re working with folks that make similar products, both brand and I\u2019d say, private label products to ramp those up to get them going so we have those that go in through with surgeries. So it\u2019s really important that we look at all of these actions to make sure that we\u2019re keeping surgeries going and keeping our customers the pain from our customers as small as possible. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to the opioid comment. I think you called out that it could take months weeks or months to get this done. And that would run into two pretty high profile state trials that are scheduled. How does this increase in spending? Does that have anything to do with maybe a longer timeline? Or how should we think about those two state trials coming up in terms of the context of your expected spend now versus what it before? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, clearly if those trials do happen, our spending goes up, which is why we gave a range, where we\u2019re not trying to indicate that they will or they won\u2019t. We just know they\u2019re out there. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We feel really good that we are and will be prepared for those trials that happen. We\u2019re not going to use those trials or have those trials cause us to panic and do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. And so we\u2019re going to continue to work with the four Gs and the rest of the states to get this initial framework done is still our goal. But I wouldn\u2019t look at the increased spending around, particularly related to the trials. Again, there is a range, but it\u2019s more around finishing up the negotiations. And then you\u2019ve got to go through a documentation process, like actually papering it. And that takes \u2013 will take some significant lawyer time to get things papered and work through all those details. So I think it\u2019s more things like those. And then an implementation process working through the \u2013 how would we distribute the free goods. What changes can we make in the overall monitoring systems. There is a lot of work to be done that will take legal cost. And so we continue to be focused on it, and that\u2019s why we put that range out. Kevin Caliendo : If I can ask one really quick follow-up on the API issue, I think, Ricky brought it up earlier. You said that you thought there was enough supply in the chain to manage it. Can you quantify like how much is actually in the supply chain in terms of product? If China were to be a six-week issue or an eight-week issue, would that still be the \u2013 would you still feel comfortable with that? Mike Kaufmann : Yes it\u2019s a great question. I can\u2019t really give you that level of detail. I don\u2019t really know where our competitors are. I know that this is something that we\u2019ve looked at, specifically product by product, looked at products that we think have more potential risk of supply challenges because of where the raw materials add in the importance of those products to the healthcare system. And we have been working to ramp up supply and a few of those to carry a little bit extra. So for, right now, from what we see, we\u2019re not anticipating any problems. But if the shutdowns in China were to go longer or it spreads and creates other challenges, it\u2019s just hard to know at this point in time. But we think we\u2019re managing it to the best of our abilities at this point in time. Kevin Caliendo : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much. Mike Kaufmann : Welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our \u2013 we\u2019ll take our last question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Hey thanks. Good morning. So in med-surg distribution, you cited that as both a headwind for revenue and profit. I guess I\u2019m a little bit surprised. We\u2019ve seen both inpatient and emergency department volumes increasing here for the last, call it, give or take, two, three, four quarters. And it\u2019s not only increasing, it\u2019s accelerating the increase at least to \u2013 according to some internal data and external data we have. We also had an early flu season. So what\u2019s going on in med-surg \u2013 core med-surg distribution in the U.S.? And what are the challenges that you\u2019re seeing now? Mike Kaufmann : I think I\u2019ll start here, and then if there is anything to add, Dave can do that. I would say this, first of all, we\u2019re not seeing necessarily anything that would say that the actual med-surg historical volumes are very low-single-digit type of growth has changed significantly out there. So it\u2019s hard for me to comment on what you\u2019ve seen, but we haven\u2019t seen anything, I would say, dramatic in that spot. Remember, last year, we had a lot of lumpiness in our first couple of quarters related to the TSAs. And so some of our compare is, we think, caused by the fact that we\u2019re comparing the last year as we were going off those TSAs. And so if you look at our first half, we\u2019re roughly up 2%, which seems more in line. And so I think we really need to get another quarter or two behind us to understand overall.  And again, with this kit recall and gown recall, there is a few challenges there. We\u2019re still trying to work through. But there is nothing, I would say, big going on. And from all the work we\u2019ve done by talking to our customers and to our reps, we still feel really confident about what we\u2019re doing in our commercial restructuring the debt over the mid to long term, that\u2019s going to be a large value creator for us. But we\u2019ve got to get through these challenges for that to happen. Eric Coldwell : Right. And I know the kit recall really didn\u2019t pop up until January. So I was clearly talking more about the last couple of quarters. Mike Kaufmann : Absolutely. Eric Coldwell : It\u2019s just \u2013 I guess maybe the TSA is an issue. We need to go back and revisit, but if we can take this up topline. Dave Evans : Yes. Eric I\u2019d reiterate a little bit what Mike said, which is, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into a single quarter of Q2 because of all the transitions going on last year. I\u2019m really looking at our first half and saying, how is the first half compared to our expectations. And the first half is really \u2013 it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations. Kevin Moran : Thanks again for the question. Kevin Moran : All right, so let me close. I\u2019d like to close by saying we remain focused on our customers and their patients, and we will continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. Thanks for your questions and your time today, and we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Take care. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. As far as the agenda for today, Mike will start off by sharing Cardinal Health\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic before turning the call over to Dave, who will cover the financials. Jason will briefly introduce himself and then Mike will share some perspectives on our mid- and longer-term strategies as we navigate this time of tremendous change. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A, we kindly ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning to everyone joining us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. These past several weeks, we\u2019ve had a heightened focus on both keeping our Cardinal Health family healthy and safe and on effectively serving our customers. As one of the largest suppliers of medical and pharmaceutical products, now, more than ever, we are committed to fulfilling our mission of supporting healthcare providers and the patients they serve. Keeping our distribution and manufacturing facilities functioning smoothly remains a key priority. To do so, we have implemented measures to protect and retain our frontline employees and maintain the continuity of our operations. And early on, we proactively and successfully implemented remote work policies for office employees. As the pandemic unfolds in different ways, and on different timetables around the world, our teams across the company are adapting to new working environments and responding to industry-wide challenges with tenacity, speed, and creativity. Our global manufacturing, procurement and logistics teams are finding innovative ways to consistently produce and ship medical products. Faced with significantly increased demand for mask, gowns, and other products, our R&D, manufacturing, engineering, quality and regulatory teams have been working together to increase supply in creative ways. For example, we have invested in, retrofitted and redeployed equipment to manufacture additional surgical mask, procedure gowns and face shields in our North American facilities. We have also repurposed production lines to make items like hand sanitizers and wipes for use in our facilities. We\u2019re grateful for the opportunity to serve our communities and healthcare providers, and we are using the full scale and breadth of our distribution, sourcing and manufacturing capabilities to provide essential medical supply and pharmaceuticals to customers each day. Demand for mask and other facial protection, gowns and gloves have spiked 2 to 12 times normal levels in the last 90 days. Supporting the delivery of these critical products is priority for us and we will continue to do all we can continue to address these increases in demand. I will share more about how we will continue to navigate this challenging environment to perform our essential role in healthcare. Now, I\u2019ll turn to Dave to discuss the financials. Dave Evans : Thanks, Mike. I\u2019d also like to recognize all of our teams for their incredible efforts serving our customers during these extraordinary times and I want to express appreciation for our suppliers and partners who\u2019ve worked diligently with us to support healthcare providers. I\u2019ve been proud to be associated with Cardinal Health and all its employees over these past nine months. Before I dive into specific results, I will share the macro level financial impact of COVID-19 as I think this will help put appropriate context around my subsequent commentary on third quarter results in FY 2020 guidance. We saw a modest net positive impact related to COVID-19 in Q3. We expect a more significant in net negative impact to both earnings and margin rate in Q4. This fourth quarter impact will be primarily due to a full quarter of reduced revenues, related to declines in elective procedures in the United States and an expected reversal of accelerated Pharmaceutical sales, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Turning to our results, in Q3 we delivered earnings of $1.62 per share, an increase of 2% from the prior year. Total company revenue increased 11% versus last year to $39.2 billion, with consolidated gross margin up 7% to $1.9 billion. SG&A increased 6% to $1.2 billion. The net result was growth in consolidated operating earnings of 8% from the prior year to $719 million. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense increased 28% to $79 million. This was primarily driven by the decline in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce our long-term debt. As a reminder, changes to deferred compensation reported and other income and expense are fully offset in corporate SG&A and have no bottom line impact. We continue to place a high priority on reducing debt leverage. In Q3, we paid down approximately $90 million of long-term debt and have now paid down approximately $880 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, approximately 4 percentage points higher than the prior year, which included some net favorable discrete tax items. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million, about 5 million fewer than the prior year quarter, reflecting the $350 million accelerated share repurchase program completed in our second fiscal quarter. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion as we focused foremost on addressing our customer needs. Keep in mind that the timing of inventory purchases and the collections on those sales as well as the day of the week in which the quarter ends all have the potential to impact point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion and we continue to have access to an additional $3 billion of liquidity in the form of our commercial paper program and AR securitization facility. Moving on to segment results, starting with Pharma. Segment revenue increased 12% to $35.1 billion due to sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, and to a lesser extent, Specialty Solutions customers. Segment profit was flat at $534 million, reflecting both the strong performance of our generics program and the adverse impact of customer contract renewals. In the quarter and more specifically in March, we saw a surge in Pharmaceutical sales. We believe this was driven by accelerated purchases related to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are experiencing below-average sales early in the fourth quarter. Though not a material driver in the third quarter, activity in our Nuclear and Specialty businesses started to slow in March, as elective procedures and physician office visits began to be impacted by the virus. While we expect these activities to gradually rebound over the calendar year, the reduced activity will be more impactful to our fourth quarter, particularly in our Nuclear business which has higher margin products and a more fixed cost structure. Before closing out on Pharma, a quick note on generics. We were encouraged to see another quarter of consistent dynamics within the generics market. Recall, we first began to see this in the fourth of our fiscal 2019. If these dynamics remain consistent going forward, we don\u2019t expect a year-over-year comparison to be as beneficial. As always, factors like mix and new launches could influence quarter-to-quarter comparability. Turning now to the Medical segment, revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion due to growth in products and distribution and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions. Segment profit increased 15% to $178 million due to an increase in products and distribution, including benefits from global manufacturing and cost savings initiatives. In the quarter, we saw the global pandemic affect for segment in various ways : We\u2019ve seen an unprecedented increased and demand for PPE products that we both source and manufacture. Because the surge quickly outstripped inventories on-hand and available market capacity to supply new PPE, we implemented disciplined allocation procedures. This was done in collaboration with our customers to balance demand and available supply, taking into account geographic areas experiencing the greatest impacts. Due to ongoing market-wide supply constraints, we do not expect to see a similar increase in PPE-related sales in the fourth quarter despite elevated demand. We continue to maximize our internal manufacturing capacity and collaborate with our supplier partners to address this dramatic increase. Inversely, given the broader declines in elective procedures, we have seen a decrease in demand for many of our higher margin offerings by customer surgical kits, [ph] porous and legacy Patient Recovery products. As we look to Q4, I will remind you that we\u2019ll be lapping the large charge we booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Med segment. Recall that this related to an exclusive distribution agreement with the Cordis supplier. Turning briefly to fiscal 2020 guidance, we\u2019re pleased with our performance to-date. Our underlying business fundamentals have been strong as have the momentum and progress of strategic initiatives across the company. With this performance and with only a few months of COVID-19 related impacts, at this time we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range of $5.20 to $5.40. We are also reaffirming assumptions provided last quarter for the Medical segment and corporate. We are however, making one update to our Pharma segment assumptions. Give expected Q4 COVID-related impacts; Pharma segment profits could now decline as much as mid single-digits for the year. Before handing this back to Mike, I just want to share what a privilege it\u2019s been to be a part of Cardinal Health team over these past nine months. It\u2019s through those experiences I witnessed how extraordinary this company is and how talented and committed the people are. This is a special place with an honorable mission and an enviable culture. I\u2019d like to thank the finance team for their support and patience and the full Cardinal Health family for their dedication in navigating these past nine months. I\u2019ll treasure the relationships I\u2019ve forged here for a long time to come. Finally, and most importantly, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to Jason. It\u2019s been great to have him on board and I look forward to working closely with him over the next few weeks to help make this a seamless transition. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thank you doesn\u2019t seem like nearly enough for all that Dave has accomplished over the last nine months. He has been a trusted advisor and a skilled CFO and his leadership has contributed significantly to our executive team and the finance organization. We appreciate his ongoing work to ensure a seamless transition with Jason Hollar who joined us on April 27th. Dave will remain with us until May 26, at which time Jason will officially assume the CFO role. Jason has been getting up to speed for the last few weeks and I already appreciate his candor and contributions. With his strong leadership background, deep financial expertise and prior experiences managing dynamic environments, he will be a true asset to our team as we navigate this pivotal time. Jason, I\u2019ll turn it to you to briefly share a few thoughts. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike and thanks to Dave as well. I\u2019ve appreciated the partnership from both of you as I get up to speed. I\u2019m really excited to join the team. While Cardinal is and has been an industry leader that is essential to care, there are still tremendous opportunities in front of us. What really drew me to Cardinal Health was both the strength of the current team as well as the positive culture and values of the organization that I share. I look forward to meeting and interacting with many of you over the coming months. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. In my opening comments, I discussed our immediate response to the global pandemic. It\u2019s clear that the current environment presents uncertainty and although there are many variables to consider as we look ahead, I\u2019d like to highlight three areas to watch that we believe could most meaningfully affect our business. I\u2019ll then share some strategic actions we\u2019re taking to best position Cardinal Health for the future. It is important to note that each of these three areas will be affected by the trajectory of the virus itself, including its potential resurgence and manageability and the timeline for developing and distributing ways to test and treat it. This, in turn, affects when and to what extent the global environment returns to some relative normal. With that backdrop, I\u2019d like to highlight elective procedures, generics availability and pricing and the potential for changes in our ecosystem. First, elective procedures. When and how patients reenter non-emergency areas of the healthcare system, including elective medical procedures and physician office visits affects multiple areas of our business. In Med, the decline in elective procedures is causing significantly lower demand for some of the higher margin offering in our portfolio; and in Pharma, we are seeing challenges in our Nuclear business, and to a lesser extent, the physician office area of our Specialty business. Although we expect near-term headwinds in these areas, we do believe demand will eventually rebound to historical levels. It\u2019s also possible that we might see a surge in some areas related to pent-up demand. We are doing everything we can to remain prepared to meet this demand and we will continue to best position these businesses for the future. Second, generics availability and pricing. Our sourcing teams and our partners at Red Oak are working directly with suppliers to understand any potential disruptions and resulting changes in pricing that could emerge. Things like potential export restrictions or the impact of the virus on manufacturing capabilities in key countries may affect the availability of finished goods or raw materials. Although we\u2019ve seen some temporary spikes in demand for certain products, the team has partnered well with both customers and suppliers to help mitigate these disruptions. Red Oak\u2019s strengths in data and analytics as well as its visibility in understanding of the supply chain are key capabilities that we will utilize during this time of rapid change. Third, potential changes in our ecosystem. Clearly, the coronavirus has changed the way we and all companies are currently operating and will operate in the future. We are monitoring the economic conditions, changes, shifts and various timetables for recovery for the participants in the healthcare ecosystem, including, but not limited to, suppliers, customers and the patients they serve. I\u2019ll discuss how we are adjusting our strategies to best position ourselves in light of these potential changes in just a moment. These are just three of the many areas we are monitoring. In response to these shifting dynamics, we have taken strategic actions across the company to partner, adapt and invest. Let me briefly touch on each of these and share how we are leveraging our scale and heritage to better serve the healthcare system and into the future. First, we\u2019re partnering to address unprecedented demand as much as possible. Surges in demand have challenged the underlying supply in the marketplace and we have worked with partners across the supply chain to help identify alternative sources of supply. We are even partnering with non-traditional healthcare companies to develop creative, safe solutions to increase production of critical products. We\u2019re also collaborating with innovative companies like Patel, one of the largest private, non-profit research and development organizations in the world. Their teams received FDA approval for collecting, decontaminating, and returning N95 respirator masks to healthcare personnel in the US and we are working with them to provide an end-to-end solution. We will continue to partner and identify additional collaborative opportunities which will be critical as we collectively navigate this pandemic. Second, we\u2019re remaining and flexible and adaptable. COVID-19 will have long-lasting and broad-reaching implications and we are thinking about how to modify our strategies accordingly. For example, we recognize that our sales team plays a critical role in supporting our customers and we recognize there could be changes to how these teams will interact with customers going forward. For that reason, across the company, we are evaluating how to use our capabilities, talent and technologies in new ways. In Med, we will focus on furthering our commercial initiatives, optimizing our supply chain and identifying product development opportunities. In Pharma, we are committed to enhancing our customer engagement experience as well as supporting our customers with new offerings and helping them innovate through this time of change. Finally, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our business for the long-term. These significant investments will be focused on our IT infrastructure, including our customer ordering platforms, key businesses such as at-Home and Specialty and our employees to name a few. For these and other investments throughout the company, we are utilizing portions of the savings generated through our ongoing cost optimization efforts. We remain on track to deliver on our savings goals for fiscal 2020 and beyond. Now, let me shift gears and discuss capital allocation. We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a dividend. Capital expenditures remain a critical priority going forward, so we expect to annually spend at least what we have in prior years. Further, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet through further deleveraging. As Dave mentioned, we\u2019re on track to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020. With respect to the dividend, our board of directors recently approved a 1% increase. Finally, going forward, we will continue to evaluate M&A and share repurchases. But in the near-term, our other capital allocation priorities take precedence. To close, we are focused on supporting the healthcare system now and into the future. We play a critical role in helping our customers combat many of the challenges this pandemic has presented. Simultaneously, we are maintaining a strategic focus on positioning ourselves for the future. Finally, I\u2019d like to reiterate my gratitude for our employees as well as for our customers and partners across the industry. It is a privilege, now more than ever, to be essential to care. With that, I\u2019ll now pause to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for all the color so far. I just want to dive a little bit more into some of the 4Q dynamics. Mike, in particular, the reduction in the Pharma outlook for the next quarter. Is there any way to characterize or frame how much of this is tied to expectations or what you saw relative to pull-through perspective? And then as you think about 4Q, mid single-digits can be a wide range. Within mid single-digits, how do you think about what has to happen in the business qualitatively to get to the varying different degrees of where you fall out for mid single-digit performance for the year? Dave Evans : So Michael, this is Dave. Why don\u2019t I start and then Mike can add more of the kind of the qualitative color to your question. With respect to the fourth quarter, I think the way you need to think of it on a year-over-year basis is that this slowdown in elective procedures is impacting our Pharma business in the form of our Nuclear business, which tends to be our higher margin product lines with higher fixed costs. So the Nuclear business itself is the biggest impact year-over-year. Recall on a year-over-year basis, we have the ongoing headwind of the contract renewals as well. So those are a couple of the biggest drivers that you find year-over-year. Now, offsetting that is the continued stability in the generics market dynamic, though a much smaller number. But, yeah, I would say that\u2019s probably the biggest tailwind. So, year-over-year, it\u2019s elective procedures, the contract renewals, marginally offset by the generic program\u2019s dynamic. So, Mike, do you want to provide more color on that then? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I think the only thing I would add, Michael, is that our Nuclear business, we feel really good about over the mid-to-long-term. It\u2019s a business that we remain committed to and I know that probably is a surprise to a lot of folks that it\u2019s a headwind because we don\u2019t talk about it a lot. It\u2019s been a business that\u2019s been growing, but it has seen a significant reduction in it\u2019s \u2013 the procedures in its marketplace. So it\u2019s seen a significant reduction and we thought long and hard about it, but we feel really good about our positioning there. And so we\u2019re doing everything we can to maintain the cost or to manage the costs as effectively as we can. But these tend to be more technical jobs that are hard to replace and we don\u2019t want to put ourselves in a position that when it bounces back that we\u2019re not ready to go. And so that\u2019s why we have decided to invest in that business, take some short-term pain. As Dave said, we expect actually Nuclear to be the biggest negative driver in Q4, even bigger than customer contract renewals but we want to be prepared for that business to rebound, which we believe it will be. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Glen Santangelo : Oh, yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Mike, in your prepared remarks, you sort of called three areas that you were monitoring closely and I was just kind of curious to maybe follow-up on two other things that you all talked about. The first was on the generic pricing trends. And secondly, I think on the Medical side, you said that there\u2019s an expectation that the recent above-average demand may not be sustainable. So I was just curious if you can comment on those two areas? Thanks very much. Mike Kaufmann : Sure. Thanks for the question. Yeah, in the generics area of availability and pricing, we look at \u2013 Q3, there were some early challenges but our team at Red Oak did a fantastic job on the generics side, making sure understanding where we thought those supply disruptions might be, adding some new vendors to the program, buying some inventory ahead of the surge. And we actually managed it really well. And so far we\u2019re seeing that in Q4, but it\u2019s always hard to know right now with this COVID, where it might be re-surge, where we might see some export restrictions in certain countries, where certain manufacturing or raw materials might have challenges that could create either availability issues that might cause price increases or raw material increases that might create some price increases. So at this point in time, I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re calling out anything different than what we\u2019ve seen generally, but it\u2019s something we want to keep an eye on because there\u2019s just this added situation with COVID-19 that we think could have an impact either in Q4 or possibly going forward in Q1. So we\u2019re just going to keep our eye on it and we\u2019ll be ready to react accordingly. And if we do see price increases, obviously our goal would be able to at least keep our margin per unit similar going forward. On the Medical side, when it comes to the PPE, the really biggest thing to think about is that we work through our safety stock. That\u2019s probably the one thing that people to probably connect is that in Q3 we saw significant surge, but we were able to essentially meet the demand of the surge because we had safety stock. By early in our Q4, we had blown through that safety stock, and so now we\u2019re really only able to supply what we\u2019re able to get in replenishment. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing that our PPE sales, we do not expect to see them to be the same as we saw in the surge in Q3, that, again, we had a safety stock to work ourself through. Kevin Moran : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Mike, given all the color that you\u2019ve provided about the Med-Surg business, I\u2019m surprised the guidance there isn\u2019t changing as much. I guess could you talk about the puts-and-takes when I think I guess about like the regular way medical supplies business versus like the [ph] Suramed business. And I guess, can you talk about I guess more what\u2019s going on inside the segment and kind of how it relates to the guidance not coming down, I kind of expect a significant guidance change to Q4? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things. Remember, we have two really big things that are the drivers for us when it comes to Medical from the positive side, and number one is going to be the year-over-year benefit of not having that charge that we had last year. So that would be number one. And then number two is going to be our cost initiatives. We\u2019ve been really, really getting after when it comes to looking at both our manufacturing, distribution and overall cost in the Medical segment. So those two are going to be the two really big positive drivers. We\u2019re also going to see strong performance in our at-Home business, our Services business. And as you can imagine, our Lab Distribution business, which we don\u2019t talk about a lot generally has had increased volumes too. And so we\u2019re seeing strong performances from the businesses. Clearly, the negative is we\u2019re getting hit very hard on elective procedures. And so our higher margin product businesses are the biggest negative driver. But I think the piece that is the key here is the excellent work that we\u2019re doing on the cost side and the performance of some of what might be considered our smaller business in the Medical segment. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just, Mike, going back to the Pharma segment; I wanted to just understand the guidance there a little bit better. I know it\u2019s probably been several years since you\u2019ve quantified the Nuclear business, but it sounds like that sounds like that\u2019s kind of a standout as far as the downdraft you expect to see next quarter. So I was wondering if you could give any context around the size of that business today versus probably several years ago when we probably had a clearer sign of the size of that business? And then I guess just the one other question is, the assumption on the core business, the kind of small molecule specialty channels, is the assumption that what you\u2019re seeing kind of late in the quarter, early this quarter, just kind of run rated through 4Q or is there a little bit more complexity around how you\u2019re thinking about forecasting the core business? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. So from a core business standpoint, what we saw was a surge in our Q3. I think you can see that through a lot of the data out there. As Dave mentioned in his script, we saw a surge in Q3 which led to upside in our Pharma business in Q3 and we\u2019ve seen the reversal of that already through April. So if you probably add the two quarters together, our assumption is that Pharma would be relatively consistent from an overall sales growth standpoint. Again, unless we see some types of surges again in this quarter that we\u2019re not necessarily anticipating, but the surge in Q3 we see reversing in Q4 on Pharma. So that\u2019s the big \u2013 really biggest driver between Q3 and Q4 when it comes to overall Pharma. We did see some and expect to see some decline in Q4 on our Specialty business because doctors\u2019 visits are down. And when you look at both oncology, in rheumatology, nephrology, you are seeing more office visit decreases in some of the non-oncology areas where we\u2019re strong. So we expect to see a little bit of that. Specifically, as it relates to Nuclear, it\u2019s about a $900 million top line business that\u2019s been growing each of the last couple of years. Ever since we had the couple of year period where there was a significant reduction in the procedures done in that business, we\u2019ve seen some consistent growth. And so what we\u2019re seeing, as Dave mentioned, this is a high fixed cost business. And so when you see the procedures decline as dramatically as we did and you have a high fixed cost, we\u2019re seeing a significant impact to the bottom line of the Nuclear business. And to try to give it some size because we\u2019re not going to get into specific details on it, but to give it some size, we expected in Q4 to be the number one negative year-over-year driver, even larger than customer contract renewals. Now, again that\u2019s an estimate at this point in time. But right now we are expecting that business to have a larger negative year-over-year impact but again, we feel good about it for the mid- to long-term. So we remain committed to it. And as we start to see electives ramp up, we\u2019re going to be ready to go to take advantage of that. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I want to ask about generics a little bit. I think you said that the generics have been improving since Q4 of last year and thus the comps will get incrementally harder. Can you talk \u2013 can you give us a little more detail on what\u2019s happening in that marketplace? Is it that the deflation is moderating? Are the spreads tightening a little bit? What do you expect going forward with regards to the generics business? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Generics, as I\u2019ve said, is one of the three key areas we\u2019re keeping our eyes on because it\u2019s an area that with COVID-19, could see impacts related to raw material changes in cost, export restrictions, manufacturing facilities may or may not be affected. So there\u2019s a lot of potential dynamics that we have to keep our eye on. But as you know, our generics program really has four components, which is the cost side which is generally managed by Red Oak and we continue to see very strong performance by that team; the sell price side that we talked about and again we\u2019ve invested a lot of capabilities into our pricing and analytics team, because our overall goal is to maintain that margin per unit which is really the key, which as we said before, is why we went away from talking about individual components. So our goal is to maintain that margin per unit and then hopefully continue to see volume increases which we have seen and some new item launches, which we said from beginning of the year we expected those to be relatively small over these next couple of years. That\u2019s generally running about as expected. And so putting those four together, we\u2019re very pleased to say last quarter we now expect our generics program to be a net tailwind for the year versus at the beginning of the year. We thought it would be a net headwind and we still expect it to be a net tailwind for the year. Not quite as big potentially with some of the COVID impact, but we still expect it to be a net positive for the year. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, maybe building on that can you give us a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 if 4Q is sort of a net negative and obviously we have Nuclear and a few other of the headwinds that you discussed. Your thoughts on how you expect things to recover in terms of volumes as we get into the back half of the calendar year? Obviously, we had a number of companies that have reported kind of giving their estimates on sort of a recovery path and in particular, some have discussed seeing more than 100% of volumes kind of in the, let\u2019s say, the fourth calendar quarter. Is this something that you are expecting as well as you project internally? And just to clarify \u2013 and just one other thing was you talked about the Cardinal at-Home. A lot of stuff is doing virtual now. Do you expect a change in overall patterns of how people see their providers in the future and does that create a great opportunity for the at-Home business? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I\u2019ll start with that then I\u2019ll go back to the other. We do feel really good about how our at-Home business is positioned. This has been a trend we\u2019ve been seeing for a while now, we\u2019ve been calling out. We think that this COVID-19 will just accelerate that trend and we really like the way we\u2019re positioned in that business. It\u2019s a business we have been investing in significantly on our interactions with the patient, how to run that business more efficiently. So we have and are expecting to have significant internal investments into that business going forward because we do believe it\u2019s going to be a significant growth area going forward. As far as the forecast goes, as you know it\u2019s our kind of way we work because we don\u2019t talk a lot about the following year until we get there and so we\u2019ll give you the color and obviously all the appropriate thoughts on fiscal year 2021 in August. But I will try to give you at least color in this elective procedures area; and on the rest of the stuff, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor. We\u2019re lucky in the sense that we have the benefit of being a June 30 year-end. We can take this next quarter, really evaluate the trends in generics, the economic health of the ecosystem with all of our customers and how are they doing and how will they hold up in the ongoing environment, and we feel really good about who we\u2019re partnered with. We tend to be partnered with the folks that are more likely to be consolidators than [ph] consolidatees, and we feel really good about that. But in the terms of elective procedures, obviously we started to see a fall-off in March. We expect our Q4 to be significantly down, both sequentially and year-over-year in terms of elective procedures. We do expect to see it get a little bit better as the quarter progresses but we do not expect an exit rate of our Q4 that would put us back with elective procedures in \u2013 back to where they were. Our point of view is that there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. We think it\u2019s going to be definitely choppy and our current thoughts \u2013 but we\u2019re going to refine these as we go forward and get a chance to look at it as though we would not expect elective procedures to fully recover in the first half of our fiscal 2021. We would think that they would have more likely to fully recover in our second half but we\u2019ll give more color later on and we are going to continue to look at that pent-up demand component. We hope it will be there. We think it could be there but there\u2019s a lot of things that we need to look at to understand going forward. So I would tell you the biggest color is we do not expect to see a full recovery until the second half of our fiscal 2021 on elective procedures. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you and thanks for the efforts alongside the commentary. A question on Medical and I\u2019m thinking what you provided on Nuclear was very helpful. You mentioned some of the better performing elements. I know you\u2019ve sized at-Home at around $2 billion in the past. You mentioned Services and Lab but can you help us with the remainder of the business? And I know that Cordis and patient recovery are portions that are international, maybe walk us through any commentary you can give in terms of sizing some of the other businesses and how they\u2019ve been impacted or expected to be impacted in the coming quarter? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. This is again something we\u2019re going to continue to look at. But as you summarized well, we would think that our Services business, our at-Home business and our \u2013 well, those two businesses would perform the best going forward and the Lab business would perform well in Q4 based on what we saw in Q3. And the other biggest driver though for us in Q4 is though we\u2019re going to continue to get after our overall global manufacturing and supply chain. We\u2019re seeing outstanding work by the team there at making our manufacturing facilities more efficient, our distribution facilities more efficient. Now, of course, we\u2019re seeing a lot of added costs related to COVID here and there, expediting product and things like that but those guys are doing a lot of really good work. So the two biggest drivers in Medical for Q4 will be the year-over-year impact of not having the charge last year related to the Cordis exclusive distribution agreement; expenses will be number two, and then the other three smaller businesses, combined together, would be like the third largest positive driver. And then the biggest negative which is why we\u2019ll still have some challenges in Q4 is going to be related to overall elective procedures where our core businesses, with the biggest one being our products business, in our OR, our kitting, our Cordis business, those businesses are going to see significant declines and have seen significant declines related to COVID. Dave Evans : Yeah, Eric, the Med is, it is a bit of a complex story for Q4. The way I [ph] distill it down is you have this charge from last year. That\u2019s nearly equally offset by the loss in elective surgeries this year. Then we have ongoing costs, benefits driven by global manufacturing supply chain and other initiatives. Those are being more or less offset in the fourth quarter by incremental cost of supply chain and cost to our labor force; the premiums to our frontline workers. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I will emphasize one thing : We have not used this pandemic and demand for products as an opportunity expand to Medical product margins. So it\u2019s important to know that, that increase is not due to expansion, of taking opportunity to raise price or anything like that. So know that it\u2019s really what Dave and I talk about. Kevin Moran : Next question, please Operator : Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Jailendra Singh : Hi. Good morning. Thanks everyone. I was wondering if you guys can provide any color around if there was any margin impact in the third quarter from the shift from retail to mail channel we have seen and, additionally, once we are out of COVID-19, do you see this mix returning to pre-COVID levels or do you think this is going to be a new norm, just curious on your thoughts on the trend moving forward? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. It\u2019s a really interesting question. It\u2019s hard to decipher because we saw a lot of just pull-forward across all channels. There was a little bit of a shift to mail order. I wouldn\u2019t call it that we\u2019ve seen anything significant. I still feel really good how our retail independents are operating. They\u2019re competing very effectively. They\u2019ve added more deliveries those that weren\u2019t \u2013 or delivering those that are working to compete and do effective things there, they\u2019re continuing to serve their communities really well. So \u2013 and we did see some 90-day at retail shift too. So it\u2019s hard to know exactly right now. I think its going to take another couple of quarters to understand how that mix will be impacted. As we\u2019ve said in the past, mail order is a lower margin business for us. So if we do see a shift to there and we are obviously working with one of the largest mail order companies, we will see some margin erosion but we still feel really good about where our retail independents and chains are positioned. And at this point in time, we don\u2019t expect that to be a huge material driver for us in Q4 but we\u2019ll have to reevaluate that for next year after we get some more intel. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I noticed this obviously this is complicated by the COVID impact, but my question was around can you talk about a little \u2013 about how you\u2019ve seen the business performance in the early parts of prior economic downturns and how maybe qualitatively if you can talk about it over sort of the longer period of a recession? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. It\u2019s hard to compare this to anything else. There\u2019s really been nothing else like this. But you can go back to events like 9/11, you can go back to events like the 2008 and 2009, and you can even go back to regional events, and generally what we see on both of our businesses is they rebound well. They tend to weather challenges like that incredibly well over the mid- to long-term, so you may see some temporary disruptions or changes, but generally these businesses tend to perform really well over cycles. And so we still feel that will be the case here. I this one is a little different in the sense of how much it has disrupted elective procedures. But again we do feel that those will recover and we still are evaluating whether or not we might see some surges related to pent-up demand, but we do feel good about the resilience of these businesses over the long-term. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. I have one follow-up on Nuclear and then my question. So, just that we understand on Nuclear. If we think about it, this was I think a $222 million business in the fourth quarter of last year. And in the guidance, in EBIT guidance for the Pharma segment, you lowered EBIT guidance by about $18 million to $73 million. In \u2013 I think we knew already about the contracts before, so should we assume that at $18 million to $73 million change is all Nuclear or is there anything else new that was not included in prior guidance? So that\u2019s kind of like the follow-up question. And my other question is really around just kind of like thinking about long-term fundamentals; like you talked about changes in the ecosystem, some other companies across the healthcare ecosystem are talking about potential changes to supply chain dynamics and bringing some manufacturing back to the US, whether its on the Pharma side or on the Med segment side. So just curious as to your thoughts on that dynamic? And if that were to happen, who would carry that additional cost? Is it going to be the wholesale distributor or is this going to be a cost that the channel will have to assume? Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I\u2019ll let Dave start on the nuclear piece and then I\u2019ll come back and talk about the long-term fundamentals, so... Dave Evans : Yeah. So let me just do a little housekeeping on the first question. So with respect to the Pharma fourth quarter segment, yeah, I think you kind of characterized Nuclear in broad terms that would be consistent with our expectations. There are other impacts though resulting from COVID-19. As we mentioned in the script, in the fourth quarter we do expect to see the reversal of the acceleration in the PD volume into Q3, so that will happen in Q4 and we also expect there to be a modest negative impact related to Specialty. So Specialty was a growing business year-to-date. It was growing in a healthy way. This slowdown of elective procedures is really going to negate some of that [indiscernible]. So Ricky those would be the major items characterizing our fourth quarter COVID impact. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. So as far as the supply chain goes, as you can imagine with COVID-19, we are evaluating our overall supply chain. We were, as you know, working through that, but with these changes we are looking at our global footprint with a new lens. We do some of our manufacturing right now for masks and certain other products in North America. We\u2019ll continue to look at that and we\u2019ve not seen any supply disruptions in those business. But it wasn\u2019t all of it. So we were sourcing globally. I\u2019m sure we will continue to be a global sourcer. We will absolutely take a look at China and how it plays in there. It\u2019s hard to believe that China won\u2019t be part of an overall global sourcing strategy going forward but the percentage of the products that are made there. And more importantly, the type of products that we make in China that we source in China, we don\u2019t have any actual factoring there. But where we source in China, we\u2019re going to take a look at that and make sure that we have the type of infrastructure that as we go forward not only in this situation but in future situations probably is more diversified and not as dependent as the US was on certain categories in China at this time. So absolutely we\u2019ll be taking a look at that. Your question around cost increases in the channel, it\u2019s hard to speak about how that will look going forward, but I will tell you, so far we\u2019ve been very transparent with our customers. They understand and have put patients first, just as we have. And for us to be able to do that, we\u2019ve had to change where we source and how we get certain PPE products and customers have been willing to work with us on those products and work with us on those higher cost. And we\u2019re going to continue to have those open and transparent conversations, continue to look at the supply chain going forward and determine what\u2019s the right and fair way to manage this situation as it goes to cost increases, either on raw materials and those types of things. Overall, over the longer-term, I\u2019m not too worried about new players in the marketplace. And with its current terms of manufacturing, I believe many of those are temporary for people that are trying to help out and just do the \u2013 feel an obligation, and that\u2019s great, and we really admire and respect the people that are doing that. I don\u2019t think many of them will stay in the business. And for those that will, that have the high-quality type of products that we\u2019re looking for, we think it could give us some opportunity to look \u2013 to continue to look at our overall number of sourcing partners and the ability to drive cost. So that is going to be a key area for us in FY 2021; is going to be managing supply chain and cost and we\u2019ll come back with more color when it\u2019s appropriate. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning and thanks, Mike, to everyone on the Cardinal team, helping with all this PP&E on the frontline. I just really want to understand two things : One just kind of dovetailing to what you were talking about. Do you see near-term opportunities to take cost out of your system? So, as you look at the ecosystem, you look at where your costs are today, do you see any cost-cutting opportunities? And then secondly, I just want to understand the health of your customer? Have you had any issues with collections? You talk about the fact that you believe there will be consolidation and you\u2019re well-positioned because you\u2019re with the larger players, but how about some of the smaller, independent pharmacies or smaller hospitals, are you seeing anything on the collection side? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, I\u2019ll let Dave talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing on the collection side and the balance sheet and then I\u2019ll talk about a few of the other things. Dave Evans : Yeah. So, on the balance sheet side, collections. Lisa, we\u2019ve seen liquidity, as you saw in the third quarter is strong and we continue to see fairly consistent trends in terms of cash flow early in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not oblivious to the fact as Mike mentioned, the economic health of our ecosystem will likely have some implications down the road. We\u2019re anticipating some. We expect those to be fairly modest in the grand scheme of things. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. And then, as again, I\u2019ve mentioned that as one of the three key areas so we will continue to look at that. And from a cost-cutting standpoint though, this is something that we\u2019re always doing. We\u2019re always taking a look at things and I wouldn\u2019t call it cost-cutting maybe in the sense that we\u2019re just cutting costs to cut costs. It\u2019s really been about prioritizing what\u2019s important and finding better ways to think about it. So if I think about when we announced what we\u2019re doing in finance last quarter, that wasn\u2019t a cost-cutting initiative. That was an initiative that saved a lot of money and reduced our overall cost, but it was out being more efficient, taking out \u2013 putting in the right locations, using AI, using robotic automations; all those types of things to really drive the right types of behaviors to have ongoing capabilities and use our skill sets at the highest levels of folks. So those are the types of things we\u2019re really looking for; like how do we do things smarter and take advantage of technology and efficiencies to get after cost. I will say one thing about the COVID situation, when we all get forced to work-from-home, you do find ability to prioritize what is really, really important and what is not so important when you\u2019re dealing with all of these types of things. And you\u2019ll also find a way I think to be faster than you normally would. And I\u2019ve seen our teams work at speeds that are just outstanding because there\u2019s such a deep commitment to patients and healthcare to get after things. So the ability to which we have flipped manufacturing plants, added capacity, work through different types of things, I do think we will find some additional cost-cutting opportunities through prioritization, technology and just being faster as a company. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019re staying safe. So just regarding the comment in your prepared remarks about the masking, gown demand spiking up, just curious if you can give us a sense for just what percentage of your Medical segment profits roughly came from PPE just in the reported 3Q, just to give us some context around that? As the profits were announced eventually; and actually just speaking to that quickly, you\u2019re filing some of your acquisitions in recent years. Can you remind us about any seasonality in the profits of the Medical segment? Is there a factor that normally drives profits down sequentially in fiscal 3Q versus fiscal 2Q because that was kind of the trend the last three years or so? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : I\u2019ll chat briefly about it. If I miss anything, Dave, feel free to jump in here. We don\u2019t really break out the PPE as a percentage, plus you get into a lot of definitional issues around exactly what\u2019s PPE and [ph] not, but what we can tell you is that it did \u2013 we did see a little bit of a surge in Q3 on that where we had significantly increased demand, as I\u2019ve said, 2 to 12 times on some products. We did have some safety stock and so we blew through a lot of that, which drove some extra incremental. It\u2019s worth talking about. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a lot of our other higher margin. Kitting and surgical businesses are going to be more important type of product lines to us than the lower margin, lower value PPE type of items. But it was important enough to mention from that standpoint. And so I would say that as far as seasonality, flu can be a seasonality item for Medical. We have seen in the past when flu ramps up in a Q, either, Q2 or Q3; we see some increases in our Med business and in some of our sales because there tends to be some hospitalization. And usually also in Q2, Med tends to be a little bit strong as people kind of rush to get some of their year-end type of insurance procedures done and we tend to see some increase in electives in those types of procedures in Q2, which leads to a little bit stronger Q2 in general for us. So, hopefully, those are two pieces of helpful information. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Stephen Baxter : Hey, thanks for the question. Hope you\u2019re all doing well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Pharma margin rate in Q3? We had seen three quarters of relative stability on that line. And then this quarter, it was down a little bit more than maybe I had expected. I was hoping you could talk about the drivers impacting the comparison there? And also you might have touched on this but any insight into how the March pull-forward volumes may have impacted the margin comparison? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. That margin profile gets a little complicated because there was a significant uptick in the surge in products. And so we don\u2019t \u2013 I would say this : There\u2019s nothing going on that\u2019s unusual in there. You probably just have some mix of certain generics, certain branded products that were higher and some lower because there were some shortages, some mix within generics. I wouldn\u2019t call out \u2013 there\u2019s nothing as we dug through the margin change that I would tell you tell you is some type of unique change that I would call out. I think it\u2019s just a lot of noise in the quarter because of the pull-forward and some of the dynamics of what items had extra demand on them and other items that maybe didn\u2019t. So I wouldn\u2019t call out anything unusual there. Kevin Moran : Operator, I think we have time for one last question, please. Operator : Our last question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks. Thanks very much. Ricky\u2019s question and I think you started to hit on mine. It\u2019s about Medical. We\u2019ve been hearing that mature suppliers like Cardinal, with their existing customers have generally committed to GPO and customer contractual prices, whereas off-contract spot prices have spiked anywhere from as much as 15% \u2013 5% to 15% in some cases. I\u2019m just curious what is the potential to revisit contracts and pricing moving forward? I mean I think we\u2019re going to have a sustained demand spike in certain Medical items, the PPE, the swabs, et cetera. Clearly, a lot of supply chain integrity, service and access demand going forward. So I\u2019m just curious, any thoughts on ability to maybe revisit pricing and margin in certain Medical items going forward? Thanks very much. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of things : First and foremost, we are absolutely committed to keeping cost as low as possible for our customers and doing everything we can to help to be part of reducing the overall cost of healthcare in this country. So we\u2019re always looking at our sourcing strategies and our own expense structures in order to get after those types of things, so we can aggressively help our customers lower their cost, either by how much they \u2013 the price of the product, how they utilize it and all those types of things. So that being said, there are a lot of disruptions at this point in time. And so it\u2019s really hard to comment on what we see of the overall long-term. We continue to want to work with our customers and will. They have been great, and we\u2019re going to continue to have very transparent conversations for us at Cardinal. That\u2019s the way we like to work with our customers. We\u2019re not afraid to tell them bad news or give them information or whatever to help them understand how things are going because we think having open and transparent conversations around the supply constraints and those types of things is important and they\u2019ve been appreciative and working with us well. So we\u2019re going to continue to have those and where we\u2019re seeing challenges in certain PPE items that have super high demand. And the only way you can get extra supply is to bring in alternative suppliers and those might be at higher cost. We\u2019re going to continue to work with them. On our own products that we manufacture ourselves, we can control the cost structure. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be able to work with them a way to maintain our contract pricing and do those types of things. But as you said, in the spot market buys to be able to take care of patients, which is what everybody wants to do more than anything else, it\u2019s going to be incredibly important. Kevin Moran : Operator? Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking to you again sometime soon. Take care, everybody. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin. And good morning to everyone joining us. Before Jason and I discuss our results and outlook, let me share a few reflections. In my nearly 30-years as part of the Cardinal Health family, I have seen this company and this industry expand with new products, services and markets, evolve with technology, regulatory and model changes, and adapt when faced with external challenges. In each of these moments, we have demonstrated grit and agility. Now more than ever, we will lean on that legacy to navigate current challenges and perform our critical role in health care. In fiscal '20, we delivered on our commitments and demonstrated these traits. We grew operating earnings, exceeded our EPS guidance range, surpassed our enterprise cost savings target and strengthened our balance sheet, all while continuing to execute our long-term strategic priorities in a rapidly changing environment. We made strategic portfolio decisions, including divesting our remaining equity interest in naviHealth, as well as investing and partnering in the evolving growth areas of specialty, at-home and services. We achieved these results as we adapted our operations to address the unique challenges presented by COVID-19. We successfully transitioned our office employees to a remote work model, and we continuously maintained operations in all of our distribution facilities, nuclear pharmacies and global manufacturing plants. Through all of this, we kept our primary focus, delivering critical products and services to our customers and at the same time prioritizing the safety of our employees. As I look toward the coming year, I recognize that the global and industry dynamics resulting from the pandemic will continue to challenge areas of our business. I am confident that our team will continue rising to these challenges as we drive our strategic priorities forward. I'll provide some comments later about how I see these priorities evolving in fiscal '21 and beyond. But first, I'll turn to Jason to discuss the fourth quarter fiscal '20 and our outlook for fiscal '21. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role, and I look forward to engaging with you more in the future. I will provide a few comments on the fourth quarter and detail our results for the year before turning our fiscal '21 guidance and key assumptions. Starting with the quarter, we delivered better than expected EPS of $1.04, driven by improved operating performance, as well as well as lower interest and other expense. Turning to the segments. Beginning with pharma on slide 6. Revenue was flat for the quarter. As expected, in Q4, we saw reduced pharmaceutical demand as a result of the accelerated Q3 sales related to COVID-19. Pharma segment profit decreased 20% to $359 million. As anticipated, challenges related to the pandemic caused volume declines in several areas, particularly in our nuclear business and our generics program. Similar to prior quarters, segment profit also reflected a headwind from pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. In Medical, Q4 revenue decreased 13% due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 related cancellation and deferral of elective procedures. This impact is primarily within products and distribution. Medical segment profit increased 24% to $120 million in the quarter, driven by cost savings initiatives and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the adverse impact of COVID-19. As expected, PPE volumes for the quarter were down sequentially, but above pre-COVID-19 levels. This reflects the demand driven sellout of safety stock in the third quarter, as well as sustained increases in demand and associated global supply challenges, which we will discuss later in our remarks. Across both segments, COVID-19 was a significant headwind to our business in the fourth quarter. Although it's always difficult to approximate the impact of lost sales, we estimate COVID-19 negatively affected operating earnings by approximately $130 million despite some improvement in elective procedures and physician office visits over the course of the quarter. In Q4, we generated $240 million of operating cash flow, reflecting our continued commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. In June, we redeemed $500 million of notes with December 2020 maturities. Additionally, we generated nearly $900 million in the quarter from the sale of investments. Now I'll transition to the full year consolidated results. In the midst of a challenging environment, we saw strong top line growth with revenue increasing 5% to $153 billion. Total company gross margin grew 1% to $6.9 billion. SG&A increased 1%, reflecting higher costs to support sales growth. Operating earnings returned to growth in fiscal '20, finishing at $2.4 billion despite a net headwind related to COVID-19 of approximately $100 million on the full year. Interest and other expense decreased 23%, primarily due to a lower debt balance and a net benefit from lower interest rates. We finished the year with $2 billion of operating cash flow. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the year with a $2.8 billion cash balance with roughly $0.5 billion held outside the US, and nothing outstanding under our $3 billion credit facilities. From a capital allocation perspective, we took additional actions in fiscal 2020 to strengthen our position for long-term growth. We invested $375 million of CapEx back into the business, focusing on enhancing our IT infrastructure and fueling strategic growth opportunities. We paid down $1.4 billion in debt, and we returned over $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our effective tax rate for the year was 25%. We finished the year with earnings per share of $5.45, up more than 3% versus prior year, which exceeded our guidance range. Transitioning to the segments on slide 10. Pharma performance exceeded our expectations for the full year. Segment revenue grew 6% to $137 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution customers and to a lesser extent, specialty solutions customers. Segment profit decreased 4% to $1.8 billion, reflecting the adverse impact of pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals, partially offset by a favorable mix of brand sales and specialty solutions grow. Importantly, although we saw lower volumes in the fourth quarter related to COVID-19, our generics program experienced overall consistent market dynamics during the year, and was a net tailwind in fiscal '20. In medical, performance was strong. Although revenue decreased 1% to $15.4 billion due to the adverse impact from COVID-19, segment profit increased 15% to $663 million. This was driven by cost savings initiatives, particularly within our global manufacturing and supply chain, and the beneficial comparison to a supplier-related charge in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. Across the company in fiscal '20 we demonstrated positive performance, despite significant global challenges. As these dynamics continue into fiscal '21, we are focused on building upon our operational momentum through the underlying strength and resilience of our business. Before I share our outlook for fiscal '21, let me first provide a few updates regarding the assumed COVID-19 trajectory going forward. This can be found on slide 13. After significant dialogue with both external and internal thought leaders, as well as with our upstream and downstream partners, we now believe that general recovery regarding COVID-19 will be a flatter, more elongated curve than initially anticipated. We are assuming a more significant impact from the ongoing deferral and cancellation of elective procedures and physician offices in the first half of the fiscal year, with an eventual recovery to pre COVID-19 levels, as we exit fiscal '21. On average, we believe elective procedures will be down relative to pre pandemic levels in the high single digit range and physician office visits will be down in the mid single digit range for the full year. Additionally, while we are working diligently to address global PPE supply challenges, we are assuming demand will continue to outpace available supply for the balance of fiscal '21. We are incurring higher costs, procuring certain PPE products for our customers during the pandemic, and this will be a headwind for us in fiscal '21, especially in the first half of the year. Keep in mind, our outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, and at this time does not assume additional widespread shutdowns like we saw in the spring. We are closely monitoring key variables such as the trajectory of the virus itself, patient psychology and returning to sites of care, our customers' capacity and the overall health of the economy. Using these assumptions as our backdrop, we anticipate earnings per share in the range of $5.25 to $5.65 for fiscal '21. This range assumes an estimated incremental net headwind related to COVID-19 of a similar year-over-year magnitude as experienced in fiscal '20. We expect interest and other expense in the range of $190 million to $215 million, which reflects interest expense savings from fiscal '20 debt pay down, as well as anticipated debt pay down in fiscal '21 of at least $500 million. We are assuming a full year non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. As a reminder, this assumption does not contemplate the potential effects of any unusual or open year audit adjustments, favorable or unfavorable, which we have historically included in our non-GAAP tax rate. Given we have multiple years of US tax audits open, we could expect greater than usual variability in our effective tax rate in the near to medium term. We anticipate dilutive shares in the range of $292 million to $296 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures of $400 million to $450 million. For the segments, beginning with pharma on slide 15, we expect mid single-digit segment revenue growth and segment profit growth in the low single-digits. We are anticipating consistent market dynamics within our generics program and a similar contingent brand inflation rate in fiscal '21 as in fiscal '20. We also expect opioid legal costs of approximately $100 million, consistent with the prior year. In Medical although we expect lot single digit revenue growth, we expect high single-digit profit decline due to higher cost associated with procuring PPE for our customers and the impact of less elective procedures. Excluding the adverse impacts of COVID-19, we would expect Medical segment profit growth to be in the mid single digits. Mike will elaborate on our strategies to COVID-19 and our plans to continue to improve the segment's underlying performance. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, in my brief remarks last quarter, I expressed my excitement about the team, our mission and the tremendous opportunities in front of us. Those initial impressions have been further confirmed in my first few months. I am confident we can collectively navigate current and future complexities to perform our essential role in health care and realize our future opportunities. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Jason has quickly learned our business, our strategy and our ongoing transformations across the enterprise. And on behalf of our full leadership team, we're grateful for his early contributions and partnership. Turning to our future. In fiscal '21 and beyond, we are focused on optimizing our core businesses and investing for growth. I will share how we are doing both across the segments. First, in Pharma. We're building momentum on a solid growth trajectory. We continue to enhance our infrastructure, deploying technologies across the segment to streamline our operations, improve our processes and strengthen our e-commerce platforms. We also continue to invest in generics, including our best-in-class sourcing capabilities through Red Oak as we drive all aspects of the program for sustained momentum and performance. Along with these work streams, we are fueling growth in key areas of the segment through strategic investments to diversify our capabilities and enhance the customer experience. In Specialty, we are beginning to operationalize the investment we mentioned in Q1 to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee. This facility includes a state-of-the-art cold chain complex with deep frozen technology, and it enables us to drive operational efficiencies, as well as support further growth in this area of the industry. In Connected Care, we are identifying and investing in innovative digital capabilities that will improve interactions with patients, payers, pharmacies and providers. We are also investing in an expanded innovation center for theranostics opportunities in our nuclear business, which will drive longer-term profitable growth. Turning now to Medical. We have multiple initiatives underway to drive longer term growth in this segment. But first and foremost, we continue to prioritize our response to customers and their patients as we navigate the pandemic. The unprecedented and sustained increases in demand for certain product categories are creating supply challenges and cost pressures for us and for our customers that will likely negatively affect our results. In response, we have and will continue to expand our self-manufacturing capacity and sourcing capabilities. Our sourcing and marketing teams have reviewed more than 700 leads for alternative sources of PPE supply. However, only a small number of these leads have satisfied our rigorous vetting process, and we are developing sourcing relationships where economically feasible. In addition to short term pricing actions to mitigate increasing costs, our teams are also building a longer term strategy for supply assurance. Regarding our commercial strategy, although our pace has been and will continue to be affected by COVID-19, we are confident in our talent and ability to execute this important work stream. We are moving forward with an enhanced focus on supporting the needs of our diverse customer base. We believe this work stream will ramp up with the gradual increase in elective procedures as its progress is dependent upon our customers' readiness to engage in incremental product and services discussions. At the same time, we continue to optimize our end-to-end global supply chain. We are making thoughtful modifications to our logistics, planning, manufacturing and procurement initiatives, and this work is on track to deliver significant efficiencies. Also, we continue to evaluate our footprint and make selective investments in our capabilities and infrastructure. Additionally, we are continuing to grow in evolving areas like our at-Home and Services businesses through investments that further enhance our strong strategic positions. For example, in at-Home, we are investing in technology that improves our interactions with the patient and drives efficiencies to create significant value in future years. Let me now turn to the Enterprise. Our commitment to efficient operations will enable us to optimize and invest. To that end, we have multiple initiatives in-flight that will deliver savings in excess of our multiyear $500 million target, as well as technology and process improvements that drive future growth. Turning briefly to capital allocation. Our priorities of investing in the business, strengthening our balance sheet through debt paydown, and returning cash to shareholders through our differentiated dividend remain unchanged. To close, although fiscal '20 presented significant global and industry challenges, we delivered on our commitments, and our team responded with the grit that I've seen time and time again at Cardinal Health. I'd like to thank our employees, especially our frontline teams, for their dedication to our mission. What we do matters. And together, we will manage the complexities ahead, continue to deliver products and solutions to our customers and their patients, and drive growth so we can perform our essential role in health care now and into the future. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. And we'll first go to Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. And thanks so much for the question. So I just want to dive a little bit more into Medical. Mike, as you think about the pathway forward on the Medical side, clearly, I think everyone on this call is probably piecing together the various different data points we're getting across the whole host of utilization [ph] driven companies. How do you think about the swing factors that would lead to the upside or downside in terms of your current outlook and how that could factor through into the potential for upside, downside to the profit growth outlook that you have? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. First of all, we're really excited that we were able to see Med grow this year. And if you adjust for COVID next year, we're excited that we have Med growing in the mid single-digits next year too. So we feel really good about the trajectory. I would say the main driver of being better or worse than where we expected is probably COVID-19 itself and the various impacts it could have on our business. First of all, if there's either major regional or an overall large shutdowns again of elective procedures, that's going to have a very negative impact on us or if it actually recovers faster or if we swing back to some pent-up demand, which - that's not what we're projecting, that could be some upside for us. So as Jason mentioned in his, we're really expecting the average high single-digits across the year in elective procedures being down for the year, high single-digits. We expect it to start higher. Obviously, we're exiting, we think from our external information and looking at ours somewhere in the mid-teens to high-teens exiting Q4 with elective procedures being down. And so we would expect to enter this year that way and then exit FY '21 at close to pre-COVID level. So that's kind of the trajectory that we see. But again, different than that, that would be the biggest potential driver. In Medical, you always have the potential driver of tariffs, FX and commodities. We're not expecting anything big on those. But as you've seen in past year, any one of those could swing one way or the other and create upside or downside. So that's probably what I would say would be the biggest potential drivers of variability in Medical. Kevin Moran : Next question? Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Glen Santangelo : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I just want to follow-up on some of the comments you made with respect to the COVID impact on the fiscal '21 guidance. I think you said you expect another $100 million of a headwind in fiscal '21 consistent with fiscal '20. Is that another $100 million or is that an incremental $100 above? I'm just trying to figure out if that's a roughly $0.25 impact you're calling out or a $0.50 impact calling out? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thank you for the question. It is an additional incremental headwind of a similar magnitude of what we saw in '20. And just to give you a little bit more perspective in '20, we saw that fairly well balanced between the two different segments, between Med and Pharma. In '21, because of some of the reasons Mike just talked about that were a little bit more impactful for medical. We would expect there little bit of an overweighting of the impact on Medical versus Pharma. Glen Santangelo : Okay. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Amado on for Elizabeth. I just have another question on the Medical side. Just is there anything you've been seeing in terms of volumes on the alternate site and acute care settings, sort of as doctor visits and elective procedures start to resume a bit? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Again, I'll just emphasize what we've said here. We do expect to enter this year somewhere in the mid to high teens down on elective procedures. That's really more focused on acute than alternate sites, when we look at alternate sites, we don't have as good of data and information quite on where that's at, and it's not as big of a driver for us in Medical as the acute business is. So we do expect to enter somewhere in that mid to high teens negative versus prior year, but exit the year at pre-COVID levels with it, obviously then improving during the year. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Thanks for taking question. Hey, guys, just wanted to ask, actually, still a little bit more on Medical, but I really want to focus on the at-Home business. And obviously, this is a business you guys got into several years ago. And at times, you've spoken about it clearly with COVID. I would imagine that the Home business has really accelerated, and you kind of hear that in the home health sector as well. Can you give us a sense more of what the makeup of this business as any kind of metrics around the size of this business, now within Medical sort of the growth rates relative to the overall business? And some of the dynamics that are impacting this that might be more positive or more of a headwind because of the pandemic relative to the rest of the business, I'd imagine, maybe this has PPE requirements that are hindering you or maybe not? Just wanted to get more sense on this segment because this is like -- it could be a bigger contributor going forward? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thanks for the question. It's interesting. We did take a look at that business. We really haven't seen much impact on that business from the pandemic. Because if you think about it, it's people that are at-Home and so they don't really have a need for PPE there because they're essentially treating themselves. And so we continue to just deliver products to the home. So that's a business that continues to grow well for us. We see it as one of our strategic growth areas. We're absolutely going to continue to invest in it, and we do see care moving more and more to the home. But we really didn't see much from the pandemic affect it either negatively or positively and also be helpful. It's about a $2 billion top line business that, again, we feel great about. Charles Rhyee : Any kind of growth rate kind of estimates you can provide us relative to the total business? Mike Kaufmann : That's a business that over the last several years has been growing somewhere in the high single to low double-digits, depending on the year and some of the various introductions of products, and we would expect that to be able to continue to grow like that grow forward. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thank a lot. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, just curious if you have any update on the opioid side. I know the next court cases are supposed to come in October, but - and any update there? I know you increased the spend to $100 million. So I'm just curious if you're getting any closer? Mike Kaufmann : It's always a great question. I would tell you that we continue to make progress on it while the COVID was happening. So conversations continue to happen between us and the various attorney generals in the states. But as far as anything that I can give you, I wouldn't say any major updates other than that we continue to make progress and have productive conversations. The spend of $100 million in FY '21 is essentially what we spent in FY '20. So we're not expecting any incremental additional spend in those fees. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions here on the Pharma segment outlook. So when you when you think about the variables that are going to impact demand, last quarter, you talked about a lot about nuclear. How is nuclear progressed in the quarter? And importantly, how do you think about the progression in the -- that's embedded in your guidance? And then when - on your slide, when you talk about brand inflation, you talk about continued less dollar contribution each year. So can you maybe give a little more color on that? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. Let me start with Nuclear. Nuclear was the business in our P segment that was, by far, the most significantly impacted. It's a very high fixed cost business. And so as you can imagine, when your procedures go down, you still need drivers, you still need pharmacists, you still - and you have a raw material that you're getting less products off of because it is radioactive and so it's deteriorating. So that business was down significantly as we expected, but it did rebound a little bit better, just a little bit better than we expected as elective procedures started to come back a little faster. They probably track closest to elective procedures on the P side, is the Nuclear business. So we continue to believe in the long-term for that business. We continue to make investments in their theranostics opportunities with manufacturers. And we still really like that business, but it was one of the biggest tailwinds in our Pharmaceutical segment. As far as the brand component goes, really, what we're saying there is we expect inflation to be the same as it was this year, roughly. But because some of the fee-for-service arrangements and mix has changed a little bit, there'll be less of the brand margin that is contingent to inflation this year than we - in FY \u201821 than in FY \u201820, which it's already at 95% or so is at \u2013 already non-contingent. So we see that getting even a little bit higher in next higher in next year. So I'll end it there. Ricky Goldwasser : Just, can I do a quick follow-up on the Nuclear? So if you exclude in the nuclear, because to your point, it's the most significant impact. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what type of growth you'd expect for the rest of the business in fiscal year \u201821? Mike Kaufmann : So just to be clear, I think I might have said the word tailwind on Nuclear and I meant, headwind for Q4. So I apologize for that. I think everybody probably knew that. But as far as growth, are you talking about specifically the Nuclear or overall for the Pharma segment? Ricky Goldwasser : Overall for the Pharma - so once you exclude that Nuclear has the most negative impact, what type of \u2013 of course, just kind of like trying to quantify and adjust for it? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, the \u2013 we would see the Pharma segment more tightly aligned to position office visits, are probably going to be the biggest driver. I would say that, what we've been seeing in some of the IQVIA data and various sources like that, we feel like that that's a business that we expect to be averaging down in the mid-single digits for the year. And similar to the way I described it, we think it will be down mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID early in the year, with it also exiting at pre-COVID levels at the end of our fiscal year with kind of a steady improvement over the year. Thanks for the questions. Next question? Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. I was hoping you could dissect some of the comments on the generics program challenges sided or headwinds sided in 4Q. Trying to get a better sense of what the total dynamics were there. Was it more about volumes due to mix impacts and health care access during the last quarter or was it more about, something specific to Cardinal, your procurement or your channel successes? Thanks very much. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah, thank you. No, I wouldn't say there was anything unusual in there, nothing that I would call out other than COVID impact related to just the volumes. So it's hard to your comment, around whether it's driven by insurance coverage or those types of things. That piece has been kind of hard to figure out. But overall, our \u2013 the generics piece being down a little bit more in Q4 is really just related to COVID volumes. Eric Coldwell : And Mike, could you give us a sense on what you're seeing about deflation dynamics in that market, buy side, sell side, pricing, et cetera? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. What we saw was really pretty consistent dynamics throughout the whole year, as we had mentioned a while back, we started to see some improvement of our Q4 of FY \u201819, and that just continued during the whole year. So it stayed improved. It bounced around up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but generally, it stayed pretty consistent during the whole year. And we're just projecting that to be just a little bit better next year than this year, but relatively pretty consistent. And next year, we expect our overall generic program to be net tailwind, which it was this year, but I remember at the beginning of year we thought it would be a net headwind. So we were able to flip it around this year, and we expect it now to be a net tailwind for us in FY \u201921. Eric Coldwell : That's helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll next go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. Mike, I know you clarified that the $100 million is incremental for next year, but I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the cadence how we should think about layering that into the numbers as we think about the progression from quarter-to-quarter? And then any more comments just around where that headwind might lie in next year's numbers versus this year as we think about nuclear lower utilization, the PPE procurement? Just anything around the buckets would be helpful. Jason Hollar : Yes, this is Jason. Let me start here. As it relates to the cadence, as Mike indicated, we see in the fourth quarter of \u201820 that we are exiting the mid to high teens for elective procedures being down and, of course, in our guidance we have high single digits down. So you would -- as an average for the year. And so you that, that will trend then from that high -- mid- to high single-digits to essentially at pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, giving you that average at the high single-digits. So yes, there's going to be some choppiness along the way, but we do anticipate that it's a relatively steady march back towards pre-COVID levels by year end. So that certainly means, from a math perspective, that we would anticipate it being front-end loaded, more of an impact front half. I also made a comment in my remarks about the cost side related to PPE being also more anticipated for the first half of the year. So for those reasons, we would expect there to be an overweighting in the first half versus second half. And as it relates to where we foresee those impacts, again, most of the \u201821 impact relative to \u201820 is going to be in more Medical. And so as you highlight areas like Nuclear, so that's going to be, again, a steady improvement. We would anticipate over the course of the year, that's tied to the physician office visits. But more of that impact in \u201820, we'll see in Medical and specifically in the products and distribution of that business and related to both the cost, as well as the underlying volume related to both the physician office visits and the elective procedures. Robert Jones : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. George Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I was wondering if you'd provide a little color on your conversations with your upstream and downstream partners around utilization, just because if you listen to some of the talk from the MCOs, they're generally expecting utilization to increase in the back half of this calendar year, where it sounds like you're still calling for a significant decrease. Would just love any extra color on the conversations you've had to help us bridge the gap? Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. We've been talking to outside consultants, been talking to our customers, senior execs there. You can imagine to a lot of folks to try to put together our thought process. So I believe it's really well informed, but it's hard for anyone to know for sure. But our take is that we won't see any of our businesses, Med or Pharma, back to pre-COVID levels until we're exiting our fiscal \u201821. So in that May, June time frame of next year. And again, as we said, start out on electives in the mid to high teens, working its way up. And then on physician office visits in more the mid single-digits down and working its way up. So that is based on a lot of discussions with folks. And I don't think we're hearing - there was a lot of early comments around pent-up demand and potentially going above a 100%, but as we talk to people when they think about the ability to drive throughput the physique folks willing to back to the hospitals et cetera. We are not really hearing people talking about that pent-up demand kind of coming through like we did before. So that\u2019s why we think we are just getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Mike, can you help us understand the dynamics of PPE? And maybe on the contracting side, it sounds like you're definitely taking on more expense, be it bought or manufactured yourself. Is there an agreement amongst the market that pricing is not going up? Or are we seeing increases in pricing that over time will be passed on to the marketplace? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it's a great question. As Jason mentioned in his script, when we think about the headwind in Medical around COVID, part of it is related to actual volumes of elective procedures and part of it is related to cost increases on certain categories of PPE. So to your point, we are seeing price increases on PPE, some of them incredibly significant on key categories. And so we've seen those now for a couple of months. As you can imagine, we've been having to procure some inventory at higher cost. And one of the things that we never want to do, if we can help it, is to pass on price increases to our customers. We really just view our job as being able to drive down cost for them and help them do that. But in order to balance the ability for them to be able to actually have products to protect their workers and for us to be able to procure them, we have had to acquire some product at higher prices, and we are working with our customers to adjust our pricing to them appropriately. This is not an area where we look to profit from this. This is something where we would look to try to just maintain our margin dollars in the area. And so we want to work very collaboratively with our customers. But there has been and will be a need for at least a period of time for us to work with them to adjust some pricing in certain areas of the PPE. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about cash flow. It's been a pretty volatile line item for you as working capital swung. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether 2020 was maybe more of an appropriate or normalized level for your cash flow? And also, anything you can share about your expectations for fiscal 2021 and whether we should be thinking about directionally with EPS or whether there's other factors we should keep in mind? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And you appropriately highlight that there was some volatility within the fiscal year '20 as well as we saw in Q3 very strong cash flow, as a lot of that volume surge benefited us and we sold out of inventory and a little bit of the carryover effect then for Q4. So when you look at the two quarters together, I think they're relatively indicative of what you should expect. I think the one thing to keep in mind, I think we've been very consistent about the day of the week in which the quarter and the year ends is very important to us. And for fiscal year '20, it was more adverse compared to many other years in just in terms of how the calendar fell. So at this $2 billion level, I think it's a little bit low from a calendarization perspective. And I think next year, fiscal year \u201821 will be a little bit more normal in that regard. And all other things being equal, I'd expect it to be a little bit better. But then, of course, it all comes down to other factors that may impact the underlying cash flow. Stephen Baxter : Thank you. Kevin Moran : Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Jonathan Yong : Hi. This is Jonathan Yong on for Steve. I guess, just in relation to the mid-teens down volumes that you're seeing on the Medical side, is that what is currently being experienced kind of what you saw in July? And I guess, is there any benefit that you're building in related to an elevated flu season or the theoretical potential of any COVID vaccine? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Right now, from a flu season standpoint, we're just expecting a normal flu season. We've not built in anything different from that. As far as vaccines go, we are obviously, like everyone, very hopeful that a vaccine will become available. We're very excited that, that could happen. We know that we have the absolute capabilities to be part of the solution of getting vaccines to folks and would expect and hope that we would be part of that. But even if we were, we don't see that as a big upside in terms of earnings, if there was a vaccine to distribute. So I think from those two standpoints, that's how I would see those two. In July, you mentioned July. What we're seeing in July really is just basically on track to what we said, what are our expectations that we would enter the year, like we said, on electives in that mid-teens to high teens and then grow. And there's nothing in July that would indicate that the current assumptions that we have built into our plan aren't playing out. Jonathan Yong : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just thinking a little bit around the cash flow question and if we subtract out the dividends and your CapEx expenditures, you don't have a lot built in for share buyback. You have $500 million of debt being repaid. The math there would suggest there's still in excess of $400 million or $500 million, maybe more to play with. If we think about sort of where the company is at this point with the cash on hand and the balance sheet being in better shape than it was a year ago, what would be the optimal use of that? Is there M&A opportunities? Is there potential that you would start to buy back stock? Can you just talk a little bit about little bit about what you might do with that any excess cash? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yeah. This is Jason. Let me start with that. And I think your math is fairly accurate there. This does give us some flexibility and I think that's where I would start, is just recognizing that we are in a little bit more uncertain of an environment, as is typical. And so this guidance does give us a little bit more flexibility to be able to react to any type of situations that may occur. One thing you mentioned is the debt paydown of $500 million. I did highlight at least $500 million in my script. So that's an example of, we'll see how comfortable we are with that type of capacity and then determine where to go from there. We have about $1.4 billion coming due in 2022 in terms of the next tower of debt. And so, that's just something that we have in our sight than you want to think about. And then we have a little bit of repo built into our share guidance. And the exact timing and amount of that is something that we will continue to evaluate, based upon all the other factors. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jailendra Singh : Thanks for squeezing me in there. So when thinking about PPE, I know you've talked before about rationalizing your manufacturing footprint. Can you talk about how the increased cost in that business area and in that business area and how COVID may be impacting your thought process with respect to your overall global footprint? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. It's a great question. It clearly has changed our thinking a little bit on our global footprint. Many of the plans that we had planned are still moving forward because a lot of our products that we actually manufacture or sell are higher end or are type of surgical types of products. And so we're continuing down that line. But as far as our far as our PPE production, I would say we're looking at a couple of different things. One is, we're evaluating the countries from which we're sourcing to make sure that we're not overly dependent on any single country or product type. And so that we will look at that because, for example, a lot of gowns were produced in China. And going forward, we want to make sure that we have a more diverse supply chain, not only overall, but for individual items. So that's one. Two is we've been - have Many of the been and will continue to increase our own capacity for the production of certain products like mask, which is an area where we made investments and have increased our productivity. And then we will take a hard look at the US. We would love to be able to do more production in the US. However, we need to make sure that we're listening to our customers and balancing their need to have lower costs with where we're manufacturing product and what's going on there. So we're going to continue to evaluate that, but continue to ramp up. And then also, we're going to evaluate the inventory levels that we carry so that we can work with customers going forward around levels of safety stock. So those are some of the different things we're looking at in our supply chain, and we'll continue to make some tweaks as we move along. Jailendra Singh : Great. Mike Kaufmann : Great. Well, first of all, thanks for all the questions, and we really appreciate all of you joining us this morning. And on behalf of the entire Cardinal Health family, we hope you and your families stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking again to you sometime soon. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran. Please go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning. This is Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2021 results along with an update for our outlook. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on our IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today is Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR section of our website or at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin and good morning to everyone joining us. I will begin with a few high level thoughts on our first quarter then have Jason review our results and updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I will close with an update on strategic actions we are taking to carry our positive momentum forward. Our strong first quarter results were due to great execution on key strategic priorities and additional aggressive cost controls in response to the uncertainties of the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19, we saw continued utilization improvement in the quarter, particularly in elective procedures. These dynamics, along with the disciplined execution I mentioned, contributed to better than expected performance in our medical segment, we saw significant year-over-year growth. And in pharma, we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of our business, which grew in the first quarter despite volume softness related to the pandemic. As a result of the strong start to our fiscal year, we have increased confidence in the full year and we are raising both our EPS guidance range and our medical segment outlook. Overall, we remain focused on serving our customers and their patients as we optimize our core businesses and invest for growth to fulfill our critical role in healthcare now and into the future. With that, I will now turn it over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first quarter performance and updated expectations for fiscal \u201821. Beginning with consolidated company results, our first quarter EPS came in at $1.51, growing 19% versus the prior year and exceeding our expectations. Total first quarter revenue increased 5% to $39.1 billion driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin grew 2% to $1.7 billion. Despite higher revenue, SG&A was flat at $1.1 billion demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. Total operating earnings grew 7% to $618 million driven primarily by strong medical segment performance. Interest and other expense decreased 52% versus the prior year to $38 million driven by lower interest expense as a result of our ongoing commitment to reduce debt as well as multiple other favorable items such as tax and deferred compensation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%, which includes a few small favorable discrete items. Although discrete adjustments may cause our quarterly tax rate to deviate from our guidance range of 24% to 26%, at this time, we still believe this range is appropriate for the full year. Average diluted shares outstanding were $295 million, about 2 million fewer shares than the prior year, reflecting repurchases completed last year. We generated an operating cash flow of $270 million during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with medical on Slide 6, medical revenue increased 1% in the first quarter to $4 billion driven by sales growth in our At-Home Solutions business. Segment profit increased 36% to $230 million driven by cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies. The following factors contributed to first quarter medical performance above our expectations. First, while elective procedure volumes were still below prior year levels, they ramped up more quickly and unexpected. Given our portfolio\u2019s general orientation around the OR, this volume improvement resulted in increased demand from many of our higher margin offerings, including our custom surgical kits and patient recovery products. Second, our lab business, which has grown consistently over the past few years to product portfolio expansion and favorable market trends, experienced a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. And finally, as Mike mentioned, our team delivered strong expense management in response to uncertainties related to COVID-19. These measures position us to operate in the best in the business for continued growth. As we have previously discussed, we continue to incur significantly higher procurement costs for certain PPE product categories due to global supply challenges during the pandemic. To help mitigate these cost increases, we implemented price increases on select PPE products with the goal of maintaining neutral margin dollars. PPE cost increases and corresponding mitigation efforts did not have a material net impact on our results for the quarter. I will discuss the potential effects of these dynamics on the segment for the full year when I share our updated assumptions. Now, transitioning to the pharma segment on Slide 5, revenue increased 5% to $35.1 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Despite expected COVID-19 related volume declines, segment profit increased 1% to $402 million driven by a higher contribution from brand sales ix. Additionally, the pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management. During the quarter, we saw improving pharmaceutical demand, enabling us to finish generally in line with our COVID-19 expectations for this point in the fiscal year. Our specialty solutions business also demonstrated improvement in the quarter resulting in strong overall growth. Our nuclear business as expected was down year-over-year, but experienced significant volume recovery in the quarter. We have mentioned nuclear then particularly affected by the pandemic due to the mix of higher margin products and the businesses\u2019 higher fixed cost structures. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capture long-term value in the radiopharmaceutical industry. Finally, we are encouraged to see another quarter of consistent market dynamics within our generics program, which excluding the impact of COVID-19, was net tailwind in the quarter. Next on Slide 8, I will move to our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. As a result of our strong first quarter performance, we are raising our earnings guidance range to $5.65 to $5.95 per share, which at the midpoint represents 6% EPS growth from the prior year. We are reaffirming the guidance ranges for each of our other corporate assumptions. This increased EPS guidance is driven by an improved outlook for our medical segment depicted on Slide 9. Because of our strong execution on cost savings, including increased global manufacturing efficiencies and the lower impact of COVID-19 related volume declines, we now expect low double-digit profit growth in the segment. With one quarter of additional insight, we are updating our segment revenue growth to mid to high single-digits for the full year. To be clear, the increase in our revenue guidance relates to better clarity on the impact of PPE pricing and we expect this increased revenue to be more than offset by the higher cost of procuring PPE products, which will adversely impact our margin rate. Mike will provide more color on our PPE supply assurance efforts for our customers later in his remarks. As it relates to the pharma segments, we are reiterating our assumptions of mid single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth. With respect to our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions, we are not assuming that the virus triggers another wave of widespread reductions in elective procedures or physician office visits. However, we are closely monitoring virus trends, patient utilization and the health of the global economy, including unemployment trends, all of which currently have varying degrees of uncertainty. At this time, we anticipate the total net impacts from COVID-19 in the second quarter to be relatively consistent to what we experienced in the first quarter. This is primarily due to the improved utilization environment offset by cost absorption on our self-manufactured products and the previously mentioned higher costs of procuring PPE. We continue to expect a lower total COVID-19 impact in the second half of the year and we assume utilization will exit the year at or near pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we continue to explore opportunities to mitigate these impacts in our business through cost controls and more permanent improvements to our operational cost structure. Now, I want to mention a notable item included in our GAAP results. Recall that in the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we increased $5.6 billion pre-tax related to an agreement in principle amongst our leadership group of State Attorneys General to resolve pending and future opioid litigation claims by states, cities and counties. While the definitive terms for settlement continue to be negotiated with better visibility into a potential outcome, we accrued an additional $1 billion pre-tax in the quarter. The estimated total cash component for Cardinal Health would be $6.6 billion, with the majority currently expected to be paid over a period of 18 years. Considering this accrual update in the dynamic global environment, let me remind you of our capital allocation approach, which we are prioritizing in the following manner. First, we are investing in key areas of our business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. Second, we are focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. And third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders primarily through our dividends. We believe this prioritization of capital does position us to both maintain flexibility and generate significant value over the long-term. I will now turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. We aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner by delivering products and solutions that improve the lives of people everyday. To achieve this mission, we leverage our scale and expertise to excel in our traditional spaces and expand into adjacencies. I will share how we are doing both, while simultaneously addressing the challenges of the ongoing pandemic through targeted investments in pursuit of this mission. First, we are enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities, simplify processes, and improve the customer experience. These multiyear initiatives will generate significant benefits in the future, some of which we are beginning to realize. For example, in our pharmaceutical distribution business, our teams are preparing to deploy the next iteration of our technology platform enhancements, creating greater operational efficiencies and better data visibility. Also, initiatives in our corporate functions will harness the potential of AI and machine learning to enable stronger insights both for our business and for our customers. In medical, our work to streamline our global supply chain network and processes continues and we are seeing significant efficiencies. We are also strategically investing to expand in high growth areas to support new technologies and therapies and to drive innovative care delivery. For example, in specialty, we are developing partnerships and making thoughtful investments that combine the technology, scale and expertise of our business with new innovations in cell and gene therapy, biosimilars, and value-based care models. Our 3PL continues its strong growth, with recent launches in traditional markets as well as emerging markets. Also, we recently made an investment in Vineti, the first commercial cloud-based platform to integrate logistics, manufacturing and clinical data for cell and gene therapies. In our at-Home Solutions business as trends and technologies accelerate in the increasingly virtual world of the pandemic, we are focused on optimizing our product portfolio and enhancing the customer experience. We are deepening partnerships with patients, payers and manufacturers to meet their evolving needs and expand our capabilities. We are also investing in our operating systems and digital commercialization capabilities with a pipeline of AI initiatives to lower our cost to serve and provide fully integrated medical and pharmacy billing solutions for our customers. These work streams will make us uniquely positioned to lead in the developing interconnected health and home space. Across the company, we are working diligently to meet our customers\u2019 current needs, while also looking ahead to what they might need in the future. While doing all of this, we remain highly focused on our internal and external responses to the pandemic. In medical, we implemented multiple measures to address ongoing supply challenges for PPE product categories. For example, we established our supply assurance program to provide consistent long range supply for our products, including exam gloves, gowns and mask. The program has been positively received. And this collaboration with our customers will enable us to collectively navigate supply volatility and deliver critical products for patient care. In pharma, we are constantly monitoring evolving treatment patterns, collaborating with the team at Red Oak to ensure supply, and focusing on delivering the industry\u2019s highest service levels. And across the company, we continue to aggressively control our expenses to ensure we deliver on all of our commitments and create long-term value. As I said earlier, we aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their integrity, adaptability and persistent dedication to this mission. We are confronting today\u2019s challenges and developing tomorrow\u2019s solutions with the tenacity, agility and innovation that makes Cardinal Health essential to care. With that, I will pause to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin Q&A with Mike Cherny of Bank of America. Mike Cherny : Good morning. Congratulations on the good quarter. Yes, I guess on question for Mike or Jason, but I just want to dive in a little bit to the medical performance in the quarter and the strength you saw especially against the backdrop of some of the PPE dynamics. If you can even parse out a little further, was there anything that was more short-term in nature in terms of what you saw on the quarter? And as you think about the risk weighting of the various different tailwinds, headwinds you have tied to the guidance increase, where do you think are the most sources for potential upside downside or what I guess maybe on the downside of the most concerning or most risky in terms of how to achieve the various levels of that cost expectation? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the question. I will start and then I will turn it over to Jason. First of all, I would just emphasize we are really excited about the efforts we are seeing in our medical segment. The team did a really good job this quarter of staying not only focused on driving expenses for the quarter in relation to the uncertainty of the pandemic, but also continuing to get after the longer term expense initiatives we had and working on a lot of the other strategic initiatives we talked about, like our commercial work. So, a lot of really good progress with Steve and his team, but I am going to turn it over to Jason, so he can give you a little bit more of some of the color you would like to hear. Jason Hollar : Sure. Thanks Mike. Yes. And first of all, we should start with the COVID impacts. And the key point is that within the quarter, there was a relatively minimal impact on the business on a net basis. Of course, there is a lot going on within that. So, there is still a headwind year-over-year as it relates to the lower elective volume. However, that was offset in part by some of those COVID-specific costs that Mike had referenced, but also increased volume in our lab testing business. So, all those items came together in a way that effectively offset one another. Another key point that you referenced and I didn\u2019t reference here is PPE. For the quarter, we saw that the increased cost that we did recognize were mitigated through price increases that also happened in the quarter. So, for the first quarter that all kind of offset. I will come back to that point in a second, but for the rest of the performance within medical for the segment for the quarter, there were also additional cost savings. As Mike indicated, this was led by the ongoing multi-year effort and building healthier future initiative that\u2019s really getting after global manufacturing and supply chain transformation. So, that was very much consistent with our expectations. But as Mike highlighted there are also some additional aggressive cost controls that we put in place due to the uncertainties in the quarter. And we saw some really great flow through of those actions, in terms of delaying some open positions and managing third party spend, that may be a bit more temporary in nature, and is something that will continue to work to see if we can make more permanent. So we have a good balance included within our guidance for all those items. Going back to PPE as it relates to the rest of the year. That is the one area that we do anticipate having higher costs in the second quarter higher net costs in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And that is just due to the timing, we have procured these higher costs, PPE inventory items, but it is in transit, a lot of that that volume is in transit. So we know that we will be incurring those costs. A lot of it\u2019s already on our balance sheet and our inventory. And we will recognize that higher costs in the second and across third and fourth quarter as we sell those items. And of course, we are also raising prices consistent with that. However, there are some timing elements that don\u2019t line up perfectly between the two. So that\u2019s the one element from Q1 to Q2 for the medical business that we would see a bit of additional headwind. Now on the flip side, we would expect that in the pharma business, there is a little bit of a, lesser of a headwind from Q1 to Q2, as that environment is a little bit more normalized, but I would not call that significant. Mike Cherny : Great, thanks. Operator : We will now take a question from Steven Valiquette with Credit Suisse. Steven Valiquette : Yes, it\u2019s Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Nothing has changed there. Hey, just want to mention, on the opioid litigation and extra charge that you took, one of your peers also took a charge this morning and they made a note of \u2013 a point of press release that it includes not only the states, but also the counties and municipalities and other government entities as well. So I am just curious with your total charge that you have now, do you \u2013 what percent of your total liability do you think that would cover? Is that pretty comprehensive or would there still be other cases to limit, just share some more color around that? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Sure. Thanks, Steve. I will give you a little bit of color here. Our view has always been that it is a global settlement that takes into account, all of the states as well as the political subdivisions in the state. So that accrual represents our assumption around that what is not in there is any private party plaintiff cases, individual or some other non political subdivision or state. Those are still out there. We intend to defend our self vigorously against those but that accrual takes into account all both the states and the political subdivisions. Steven Valiquette : Okay. And also a few questions is found from investors on the run rate of medical profits on a quarterly basis. Obviously, this fiscal first quarter was very strong. Any additional thoughts on kind of quarterly run rates from here might be helpful as well? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes, I don\u2019t think there is too much more to add than what I just went through where, again, from a Q1 to Q2 perspective, we definitely anticipate there being a greater headwind related to the PPE recognition of that cost. But for the other elements, we continue to see relatively consistent types of dynamics there. And then, as I also mentioned and Mike touched on as well, as it relates to the underlying cost controls, we feel really good about our performance in the first quarter. Some of those were absolutely permanent and part of those structural cost reductions that we have been putting in the place for the last several years. But other elements were very specific to the pandemic and really tightly managing our costs and then perhaps and a little bit of a shorter term, we will continue to evaluate those initiatives and see if we can make them more permanent by changing the way in which we do on certain things, which is very consistent with our building healthier future initiatives elsewhere. But we need a little more time to work that through. Mike Kaufmann : The only other thing I would add is that we did exit the quarter, roughly mid single digits down on electives. And so that was better than our expectation. And as Jason said, we expect to finish the year, near pre COVID level. So a lot of the upward trajectory already has occurred in the first quarter. So you wouldn\u2019t see that sequential is not as big as maybe it was historically, when we were first thinking about this. I think that is one component, also to keep in mind. Next question, please. Operator : And our next question will come from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. AdamHeussner: Hi, this is Adam on for Jailendra today. In terms of the cost savings, which were partially contributing to the EPS raise, just curious of how much of the improvement there had already been planned versus if you expedited those cost initiatives? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes. So, as I think about the \u2013 let\u2019s just step back and think about the raise for the full year guidance that is entirely due to the medical performance and you saw that we raised the outlook there as well. And so within that, we had two key components, first of all, COVID is being \u2013 is better, less of a headwind than what we had anticipated, although it\u2019s still a headwind for the year and that is the most meaningful impact, but also significant within that not insignificant is the underlying cost reductions that we have been referencing. So, both go into it, but I would say COVID is a little bit more of a benefit there versus the cost savings, but still very meaningful. Mike Kaufmann : And then I would just add, we have also seen really good performance on our lab business, in the first quarter that we would expect to continue through the rest of the year and so some of our other components of our business performed very strong too. Jason Hollar : And one other item, maybe just to make sure we referenced is tax rate for the first quarter was a couple of 100 basis points lower than the midpoint and lower than the range that we have. That is just the timing of some discrete items that were all anticipated when we established our guidance range. So we will continue to have some fluctuations there, but that does look like an impact in the first quarter that we would expect to revert more to the mean by the time we get to the end of the year. AdamHeussner: Thanks. Operator : Now we will move to Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Adam Noble : Great. Thanks for the question. This is actually Adam Noble on for Kevin. Just wanted to go back to the lab business, curious if you guys can kind of size how big a business that is within the overall medical segment than you are just curious is that mainly the hospital channel or do you have a significant presence with outpatient labs in other areas of the lab testing to universe? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, our lab business has been a business that we have had for a really long time. It always has been a consistent grower for us both on the top and bottom line for a lot of years. It\u2019s main customers are basically the outpatient labs and other hospital lab type of businesses. So, those are who we are supplying, we have a very robust product line, some of which is our self-manufactured or sourced items as well as we work with all of the national brand players. And so while it\u2019s always been a business that has performed well and grown nicely for us with the increase in COVID testing, that business has had some additional growth this year. They have also been a real leader in getting reagents out, testing equipment, working with folks on helping on the swap supply early on. So at the business, we are really proud of the team there and continue to feel good about their growth this year. And we actually are evaluating how much of that might continue on going forward as we continue to look at that business going forward, but really strong performance by the lab business. Adam Noble : Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. With regards to the medical business overall, I am just curious if you can talk about the recovery in utilization there between the U.S. as well as some of your international footprint then your comments around not expecting to see a real drop in elective procedures, probably most likely in the U.S. in COVID, I am just curious given some of the lockdowns that have recently been implemented in Europe, whether there is any pipe insert there that you can do? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think the first thing I think we all need to keep in mind is it will probably be very choppy over the next 6 to 12 months, it\u2019s hard to know how long, but I do think it will be choppy. We are even seeing small shutdowns here and there in the U.S. and then obviously potentially in Europe in different spots. As far as our \u2013 the majority of our product is going through our U.S. channels. And as I said, it relates to electives, we exited Q1 down mid single-digits and expect to get at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. And while that\u2019s not a huge sequential growth, we do expect it to be somewhat choppy and it\u2019s hard to exactly predict on a quarterly basis. But we feel good about our current guidance, as it relates again assuming there is no major shutdown, if we had everybody shutting down again like in our Q4 that would create some different types of concerns. But as long as we received spotty types of \u2013 lumpy type of shutdowns, we would expect the \u2013 we can manage through that. As far as in Europe, again, that is just product sales, you don\u2019t do distribution over there and our current guidance does assume and get some choppiness over there and we are not looking for major shutdowns over there either. Adam Noble : Great. Thanks for the question. Mike Kaufmann : Next question. Operator : We will now take a question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike and Jason. Just as we think about the pharmaceutical distribution business, on a go forward basis, Mike, can you talk about maybe what you saw in the quarter around new prescription volume trends and expectations, we understand that people are starting to go back to the physician office, but just looking at IQVIA data, it doesn\u2019t look like trends for new prescriptions are back to what they were historically. So you can talk about what trend you are seeing there. And then secondly, we think about your guidance and think about your pharmaceutical distribution component, can you talk about your expectation for biosimilars in your numbers? Do you have an expectation that that\u2019s going to be a positive for you for this fiscal year and how do we think about potential margin differentials? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I will just start with the biosimilars first and then move on to the RX trend. We do continue to see biosimilars gain momentum with increased adoptions across multiple sites of care. And we have been successful working with the suppliers and our customers. In this area, we think we are really well positioned to distribute and provide services both upstream and downstream to the biosimilar players. Generally, biosimilar margins are similar to branded margins. It depends on the individual supplier and the product. There are some opportunities when you are able to move share through your GPOs and stuff to make some potential extra margins on that. But generally, as I said in the past, the real margin opportunity for us in biosimilars over the mid to long-term would be as if they get an interchangeable designation. And then now I think that will increase the opportunities for us to really make what I would say more meaningful contributions to our bottom line. So, while we continue to be very excited about the future potential for biosimilars they have really not at this time reached a level of materiality for us. And then flipping to your other question around RX trends, I think the first comment I would make is the real resilience of the pharma segment in general. This is a business that it seems like whenever we go through large challenges in the U.S., it\u2019s a business that continues to, while it may have some headwinds, continues to be very resilient to the overall marketplace. Now, we also know in our pharma segment that includes our nuclear business, which as Jason mentioned, was coming back nicely in the quarter and tracking well. So, we are glad that we maintain both the people and the resources and commitments there, because we did see that bounce back still below prior levels, but bouncing back nicely. As far as your comment around the IQVIA data, actually I would say that what we are seeing is that our general business tracks pretty closely to it around both new RX generics etcetera. So we are not really seeing any trends within our business that I would call out that are much different than what we are seeing in the overall IQVIA data. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Now, moving to Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Elizabeth. Just a quick question on Cardinal Health at-Home, could you give us a sense for kind of how you see demand trending as you progress through 2021? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, this is a business we continue to be super excited about. As we have said a couple of different times, it\u2019s one of those areas that we have called out as one of our strategic growth areas with both specialty, our services businesses and Cardinal Health at-Home, we are a leader in the space and we intend to stay that going forward. And so we did see very nice revenue trends in that business, we continue to make investments in that business specifically to continue to grow and have a very nice both mid and long-term view of that business. So, we remain excited about the team, our resources, the pipeline of opportunities we are working on feels really good in that business. Next question please. Operator : We will now move to our next question and we\u2019ll hear from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I want to ask for a little bit more detail on the nuclear business. And I am curious to hear if some of that strength has been in specific areas across cardio or neuro or onco? And has that been a pretty good forward indicator for upticks in volume and maybe getting back to the new scripts you are talking about? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We have seen a little bit of difference between onco coming back faster than cardio. So, we do a lot of work in both those phases in our nuclear business. And really, as we expect it, it has bounced back nicely. But to your point, what we have seen both in nuclear and in our specialty business is that onco has bounced back much faster than other ologies whether it be cardiology, rheumatology, nephrology, but particularly to nuclear, our cardio business has bounced back a little bit slower than oncology. Eric Percher : And was there cost reduction there that may come back as you get back to full speed? Mike Kaufmann : Actually, it\u2019s a business that is pretty fixed cost business. And so we did not take any \u2013 we took appropriate cost reductions. But I wouldn\u2019t say we took aggressive cost reductions, because we really believe in that business over the long-term. We think it has a very nice pipeline of projects we are working on with manufacturers for clinical trials the theranostics area we think is a real growth area for us. So we decided essentially as we kind of talked about last quarter, just to hold on to both \u2013 our people, because the rest of our assets, being whether it\u2019s our manufacturing facilities with our cyclotrons or individual pharmacies, which still needed to be staffed. We didn\u2019t make extra aggressive cost reductions there. And so it\u2019s nice to see it bounced back and delivered the type of results that we saw in our Q1. Eric Percher : Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Next question. Operator : And our next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. One question related to specialty, obviously, there was some big news on Biogen yesterday and we are getting questions from investors and how should we think about drugs like that is potential contributors to your business? Should we think about it as flowing through core distribution through specialty? And then also any thoughts about a potential role for Cardinal in distribution of COVID vaccine once it\u2019s available for the general population? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. As far as the specialty products, I would say this is \u2013 what I really like about our position is we can manage both. We have the capabilities for a manufacturer to choose going through our pharma distribution business. Obviously, we serve one of the largest chains, the largest grocery chain, largest mail order insurer. So we have got a lot of strong customer base as well as a strong presence in the acute space that our pharma distribution business has the reach to be able to match specialty drugs that way and then also with our specialty business, they can go that way. So, that\u2019s something that we feel really good about that. We talk to manufacturers all the time and can work with them in either way. A lot of manufacturers, it depends on who the ultimate customer is and who they are trying to reach on which one they may choose. And sometimes that they will choose both, depending on certain customers will go one way and other ones will go the other. So, it\u2019s hard to specifically talk about any individual drugs. We don\u2019t really like to do that. But in terms of having the capabilities, I am confident that we can do that anywhere, even up until including, if it\u2019s a smaller company that\u2019s launching a drug and need services all the way from soup to nuts. The third-party logistics business we have is from performing incredibly well in our specialty space. So, someone that needs customer service, shipping, billing collections, etcetera we can do that too. As far as the COVID vaccine, as you know, as far as Phase 1 has been, one of our competitors has been chosen to do that in Phase 1. We continue to have daily conversations with the folks in the government around being part of it. We have the absolute capabilities to do it. We have been shipping many different types of vaccines for years. So, we have both ambient and cold chain storage capabilities and shipping capabilities to do that. And my belief at least from what I think is probably best from making sure that the product is available for our customers and the fact that we are going to our customers every day is that down the line, I think it would make the most sense for all the key distributors to be part of the Phase 2 of this when the products become more readily available and we stand ready to do that when that happens. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Jason Hollar : Next question? Operator : And our last question today will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. And Mike, I apologize if you touched on this already, but as you think about the guidance for the balance of the fiscal year, can you quantify what your guidance implies in the core drugs business I guess as a percent of return to baseline from pre-COVID like I guess the guidance assume that we get 95% back, 98% back, just be interested in any color you could provide around that? Mike Kaufmann : Specifically, well, I can talk specifically to pharma, we really feel like we are tracking very similar to the IQVIA data and that RX trends, remember our year end being June 30 would be at or near pre-COVID levels by the time we exit the year. And so that\u2019s kind of how we would see it progressing over the next three quarters, again with the caution of being some potential lumpiness as things happen specific to RX\u2019s. Does that answer your question, George? George Hill : Yes, it does. And maybe if I could just do a quick follow-up, one of the things that we have also seen from the IQVIA data that flu vaccine volumes have been strong, I guess have you guys participated in that and the kind of the derivative follow-up there, have you seen any change in mix as we think about kind of what is been going on in the drug business over the last 3 to 6 months? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it\u2019s an interesting question. It\u2019s flu vaccines have been significantly up this year and we do distribute those and we have distributed significant more blue vaccines this year than we have in historical years. Probably, for the combination of the fact that more people are getting vaccinated as well as practicing distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, etcetera, we would expect much lighter flu season this year than historically, but we are not seeing any big necessary mix changes in our pharma business at this time, but we are keeping an eye on it, because as different physicians get back into work and people start visiting them, we may see a little bit of mix, but right now, nothing I would call out as material. But again, I just keep focused on that where we do expect it to be nonlinear, a little bit lumpy over the rest of the year. George Hill : Helpful. Thanks, Mike. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for any closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and then on behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I hope you and your family stay safe and well and we look forward to speaking to all of you that sometime soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2021 results, along with an update to our FY21 outlook. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start our discussion with a few high level thoughts on our progress so far this year. And then, Jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal \u201821 outlook. I\u2019ll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas. We continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. Overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectation, led by the Medical segment. In addition, we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver EPS growth of 14% in the quarter. Due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. In the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. Our Medical segment saw a net positive impact related to COVID-19 as our lab business and PPE products continued to experience strong demand. And in pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. Across the Company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic release efforts. In Pharma, we partnered with the CDC to act as a network administrator, enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. And in Medical, we partnered with the state of Ohio to support vaccine distribution through our OptiFreight Logistics business. Regarding PPE, we are utilizing our Supply Assurance program to manage costs for our customers and provide consistent long range supply in key product categories. We are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories, such as gowns and masks, but continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. Looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. And we are ready and willing to help in any way possible. Before I provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with total Company results, second quarter ups was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase, driven by discrete tax items and strong Medical results. Total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin was flat at $1.8 billion. SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion, due to IT investments. The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from COVID-19. The Pharma segment was adversely affected by COVID-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in Medical. I\u2019ll discuss these segment impacts shortly. Interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction, as well as an increase in the value of our Company\u2019s deferred compensation plan investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items. Now, a quick note on the GAAP tax impact during the quarter. Primarily due to self-insurance loss in our fiscal \u201820 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. And as such, in the quarter, we recorded a net GAAP tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. Additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, during the quarter. As a reminder, the day of the week, in which the quarter ends, affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance at $3.7 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. We remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment grade balance sheet. Our next debt maturity is in June 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. By the end of fiscal \u201822, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount, so the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with Medical on slide 5. Medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from COVID-19 and solid execution by our team. As we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding PPE and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand, resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures. Segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. The net positive segment profit impact from COVID-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from PPE that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts. As it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. While difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal \u201821. Regarding PPE, we saw both, higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. As previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select PPE products during the pandemic, and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary, as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers. On electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single digits versus our pre-COVID-19 baseline. Finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. And outside of COVID-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives, like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings. Transitioning to the Pharma segment on slide 6. Revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. This was driven by COVID-19-related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business, and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter. Our specialty solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers, and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. Also, our generics program when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of COVID-19, continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Next, on slide 8, I will review the updates to our fiscal \u201821 outlook. Due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal \u201821, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint represents 10% year-over-year EPS growth. This improvement is driven by strong performance in our Medical segments, as well as updates below the operating line. Regarding updates to other corporate assumptions, we now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. As a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. We\u2019re lowering our non-GAAP ETR range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rate in the back half of the fiscal year, due to the timing of discrete items. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million. Regarding the segment outlooks on slide 9. For Medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low to mid-20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high-single to low-double digits. Regarding the Pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-single-digit profit growth. To conclude, some comments on our enterprise COVID-19 assumptions for the back half of fiscal year as we begin to lap initial impact to the pandemic in the prior year. We continue to expect the utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near prepandemic levels. And for the enterprise, in fiscal \u201821, we continue to expect the year-over-year net negative impact from COVID-19, though less than originally anticipated, due to improved medical expectations. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. I\u2019d now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in healthcare and how we see this role evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. I said last quarter that we aspire to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities, and employees. We create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth, all while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams. First, as we\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today\u2019s challenges and adapt for the future. For example, as Jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. Through our Cardinal Health brand portfolio and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagents and consumables, enabling both, independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients. We are also enhancing our core Medical and Pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities, as we continue to adapt these models for the future. We are making strong progress in both segments on our supply chain work streams in generating near and long-term efficiencies. For example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square-foot Medical segment replenishment center, near Chicago, that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. This facility is the second of its kind in the last year, and is part of our multi-year plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increase capacity to meet customers\u2019 requests for pandemic storage. We are also making strategic investments in our IT infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. At the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic, long-term growth in key areas and not only support, but also anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. Our investments in the areas of specialty, at home, medical services, nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. Recall, I noted at a recent conference that these five businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue, and together, they have a double digit historical three-year revenue CAGR. Let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. In medical services, which includes our OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, with our recently announced TotalVue Analytics tool in our OptiFreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insights and savings in their healthcare supply chain logistics management. And in WaveMark, which as a reminder, is a software-as-a-service platform, optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both, our installations and our pipeline, as we continue to go live with additional customers. WaveMark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies. As our nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. We continue to build out our Center for Theranostics Advancements in Indianapolis, and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming on board. From supporting manufacture development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered. In addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. Our efforts over the past six years to transform our selling model, strengthen our world class service levels, and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers. And we are excited about the mid to long-term future of this business. And finally, in Connected Care, we are making additional investments in technology solutions and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing, and to enable more meaningful, cost effective and outcomes-driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. Demand for these solutions continues to increase, with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients, and 60 payers. We are sending more than 400 million tests annually to support medication management. And in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the COVID-19 vaccine, with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. We will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas, and then our core capability initiatives as they materialize, over the coming year. Before I close, I want to thank the team here at Cardinal Health, who continued to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. Finally, I will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. As we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions to create value and improve lives. With that all pause to open up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for all the color so far. If I can dive a little bit into the Pharma headwinds, as you think about the outlook for the rest of the year. How do you think about the trajectory and the visibility on nuclear, and then, also the headwinds on generic and when they could recover for you? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. I appreciate it. I guess, really couple of things to keep in mind. We\u2019re really pleased with the resiliency of our Pharma segment, both in the pharma distribution as well as the specialty and nuclear business. We do continue to see really COVID-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we\u2019re seeing there. It\u2019s good, so far, that a lot of the things that might affect the segments, such as brand, inflation, that\u2019s kind of off the table from what we\u2019ve seen in January. We feel like we\u2019re executing really well on our initiatives. And also, from a cost savings standpoint, we\u2019re on track. And then, generics, which is, always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors, we\u2019re not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. So, a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for Pharma. But, what we really see is, COVID being the main swing factor. The things I would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. We would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. But, we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-COVID levels. And as we said, our guidance continues to be low-single-digit growth for the segment. Jason Hollar : And if I could just add one point, Michael, it\u2019s Jason. And your point about nuclear, we did see the headwind year-over-year be a little bit less than what we saw in the first quarter. So, kind of follows -- continuing to follow a little bit of what we\u2019re seeing with electives a little bit more than other elements of the underlying volumes. So, not a lot of new news there, but a slight improvement sequentially. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Robert Jones : Hey, great. Thanks for the question. Maybe on the Medical business, I think we all understand that COVID\u2019s having significant impact across the segment. But, I was hoping maybe you could help us with what you\u2019re assuming in the back half in Medical, particularly on the EBIT line. It just seems, based on the results to-date and the updated guidance, you\u2019d have to see kind of mid-20 declines in the back half versus the front half. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces related to COVID, but I think at a high level, Mike, I would think, as you maybe see some of the drivers of the front half potentially fade, you would obviously see the legacy kind of surgery recovery product lines pick up. Just trying to get a better sense of what you\u2019re assuming that could really drive this kind of back half decline versus what you\u2019ve seen in the front half. Jason Hollar : Yes. This is Jason. Let me start it off. Yes. Like you said, we\u2019re really pleased with our first half performance. Certainly, two good quarters here now, as well as on top of last year\u2019s double-digit growth as well, and then still guiding to low to mid-220s for the year, we feel very good about. To the point about the trends first half versus second half, as we stated in the remarks, we did see some Q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain PPE products. So, that\u2019s an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in PPE that drove medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with COVID in the quarter. And so, that\u2019s just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter as we go forward. The other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. And so, we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. And then, the third point I\u2019d make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. As we highlighted as the number one capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And so, we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Jailendra Singh : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned a few things you\u2019re doing to help with the vaccine rollout. I realize these programs in and off themselves aren\u2019t going to move the needle for the Company. But just curious as to how this work might set the Company up for future opportunities for you guys to participate in future phases of vaccine distribution. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. I appreciate the question. Yes. We\u2019ve been -- continue to be involved in staying up-to-date and everything as it relates to the vaccine. As we\u2019ve said, we are working with the State of Ohio, helping them distribute the vaccine. And we\u2019re also a partner with the CDC acting as a network administrator. And so, we continue to do that. And there are some other areas where we\u2019re having some small touch in that area. At the end of the day, I believe that -- our belief is that this is one of the most important events in the country\u2019s history, and that bringing the full scale of the distribution capabilities of all the distributors to the market is going to make the most sense over the long term to be able to effectively distribute and get the vaccines to folks. And so, we continue to make sure that we\u2019re doing all the things to make our self ready to be able to participate and help out however we can. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. Can we dig into the PP&E price dynamics a little bit? I think, last quarter, you talked about the ability to pass on pricing. And this quarter, I expect that we were going to see some input costs increases. So, can you help square that with the pull-forward you just mentioned? And maybe more broadly, price versus cogs, Q1 to Q2, and then what to assume second half? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. And let me just kind of step back and talk about PPE in general and try to loop in that piece as well. Certainly, the overall the demand dynamic here obviously continues to be quite strong, and we are seeing certain components get a little bit more in balance between supply and demand. But, certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. It\u2019s probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. So, we continue to see that demand just far outstripping that supply, which has created some just some supply chain inconsistency, not only -- so now we\u2019re dealing with just the timing of supply, but we\u2019re also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases. So, it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these costs increases to be delayed then until later quarters. So, overall, our key objective remains the same to make sure we\u2019re mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the Supply Assurance program. But the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to manage that as appropriate. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. The only thing I would add is that while the PPE is clearly a driver, our lab business really was a big driver for us this quarter in the Medical segment. And we continue to be excited about its growth. And its ability to continue to maintain that growth, at least for the remainder of fiscal \u201821 is our current assumption. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Gill, JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : Mike, I just wanted to get an understanding of how you\u2019re thinking about utilization, as we go into the back half of your fiscal year. One, are you seeing an impact with less cough, cold and flu? And then secondly, you talked about the RX segment in the quarter having an impact due to generics? What are you seeing, is it more of a trend? You said branding, what -- kind of came in line or was positive? Is that new prescription volumes continue to be down, at least based on the data we see with IQVIA? Is there anything going on with your buying groups? Just how do we think about utilization, and any other comments you can give us around how to think about the drug distribution -- or the Pharma distribution component of your business in the back half? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks, Lisa. A couple things I would say. I guess, first of all, it\u2019s important to know that sequentially, there is really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between Q1 and Q2 for our Pharma business. And also I would say that -- all the impact that we\u2019re seeing on volumes in generics is really from our view just related to COVID-19. So, we\u2019re not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. It\u2019s really just the volume as it relates to the COVID-19. And as we said that -- we expect that to continue to be choppy. We saw a lot of up and down over the last six months. We would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. As it relates to flu, as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general, for us. It can be a small driver. And as far as the flu goes, we\u2019ve hardly seen much at all. So, in terms of -- vaccine distribution has been a little higher, but all of the other type of ancillary products such as the Tamiflus and those types of things, they have been down obviously. But again, it\u2019s incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in Pharma, which again, we just are focused on COVID. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim. Glen Santangelo : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I just wanted to ask a quick question about your share count guidance and your interest expense guidance. It looks like you raised the share count guidance but you lowered the interest expense guidance. And I appreciate the comments you made with respect to the deferred comp adjustments. But, I was just curious, if you\u2019re changing at all your capital deployment priorities in the near-term? And secondly to that, is the potential opioid settlement at all a consideration in your capital deployment priorities for the balance of the year? Jason Hollar : Okay, great. So, in terms of interest, let\u2019s start there. Yes, you\u2019re right. Consistent with my comments, the deferred comp elements is driving the guidance change. And as I highlighted, that\u2019s entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate SG&A. So, there\u2019s no net EPS change associated with that. And of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. So, we just don\u2019t see a lot of variation, as it relates to where rates have been. And so, then -- I\u2019m sorry, there were three parts. What was the second part? Glen Santangelo : Share count. Jason Hollar : Okay. So, the share count, we\u2019re still within the guidance range of what we had before. It is slightly at the high end, to your point, as you can see. In the first quarter, we didn\u2019t do any share repo; we didn\u2019t do any in the second quarter as well. But the high end of that share count would imply no repo. The low end of this new range would be modest amount of repo. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s baked within that assumption. As it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven\u2019t changed our priorities. Of course, we work within those priorities. And just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business first and foremost as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. And you saw that this quarter with the medical global manufacturing and supply chain work, we\u2019re making some great progress there and we want to continue to feed those activities. The other point that I referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority was just to maintain our strong investment grade balance sheet. So, I did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion, as it comes due at the end of our fiscal \u201822. And we think that\u2019s consistent with that priority. And then, of course, we return the cash to shareholders, primarily through the dividend as our third priority. After that, it is repo and other bolt-on strategic M&A. But, we\u2019ll continue to look at that opportunistically, as we get more confidence on variables, such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. And as our confidence increases, we make more progress, understanding what the framing of that looks like. Then, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. But, we continue to balance all those each and every day. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I kind of wanted to go back to Eric\u2019s topic a little bit on PPE pricing. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of call out the positive impact of pricing in the first half of the year. And Mike, I guess, I\u2019d be interested in your commentary on how long pricing stays elevated? Do we think this is the new normal or at some point in the future, are we going to have to worry about PPE price deflation? Jason Hollar : Yes. So, let me start, at least with that first part. We\u2019re not going to break out explicitly the pricing separately. First of all, it\u2019s just really important to highlight that the pricing is meant to cover that cost increase. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re balancing there. We did, however, say in our last guidance update in Q1, that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for Medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing. With this update, it\u2019s definitely more balanced, more weighted towards volume increases in the lab business, as well as volume increases in PPE, and then, to a lesser extent, any type of price changes. So, it\u2019s -- I would just go back to the guidance increase and it gives you a better understanding of what that PPE pricing dynamic is being driven by. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. The only thing I would emphasize, just to make sure that it\u2019s clear is, as the cost of the PPE comes down, our revenue will come down. But again, our goal has always been to maintain margin dollars and work with our customers on an assurance program. And so, you shouldn\u2019t think about declining PPE costs necessarily being a headwind for us, other than revenue. And, as Jason said -- but the timing of when you have the actual sale price and the cost as they flow through that can create a little bit of lumpiness in the recognition. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, two questions here. One on the pharma distribution segment. When we look at the implied growth for second half, EBIT is growing faster than revenue. Now, clearly, there are some easy year-over-year comps versus the same period last year. But, as we think -- and I know it\u2019s too early to think about 2022. But really, if we think about different drivers that expectation that generic volumes are going to come back and nuclear, which is higher margin, is it sustainable for us to think that we\u2019d be able model EBIT continuing to grow faster than revenues for the distribution segment? And my other question was just if you can give us a quick update on opioids and where we stand? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. As far as -- I\u2019ll just cover the opioids quickly. As I\u2019ve said in the past, it continues to be, as you know, complex negotiations, a lot of moving parts, but we\u2019re continuing to make progress there. As far as on the Pharma guidance goes or thoughts there, obviously, we can\u2019t talk about at this time \u201822. But, you\u2019re right on those components. First of all, we would expect, if we exit at or near pre-COVID levels that our nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially, as it goes forward. And we have a lot of confidence in that business. As you know, I highlighted it in my comments around not only how they\u2019re performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we\u2019ve made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long-term in the theranostics space. And then, again, as far as generics go, I guess, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of COVID. And so, rest of the program continues to be -- as we expected, we continue to see that program, all the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected, which is COVID being the driver. So, again, as COVID begins to be less and less of an impact, we would expect to see our volumes in our generics programs to grow. Jason Hollar : Yes. The other thing I\u2019ll add is, relative to the nuclear comment, Ricky, as it relates to the revenue and margin balance there, I think, you\u2019re on the right point that as we talked, especially in Q4 of last year, when the volumes were declining quickly, nuclear is a high-margin business. It is also a high fixed cost business. So, it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in that fourth quarter. And so, as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the -- at or near pre-COVID levels, by the time we exit the fiscal year, then you would expect there to be, for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the Pharma side, can you talk about biosimilars and to the extent that they\u2019ve had an impact? Commentary from some of your peers would suggest that it\u2019s starting to become a more meaningful contributor. Just wanted to get a sense, within -- in the Pharma segment, how much that\u2019s having an impact? And then -- yes, that\u2019s basically it. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Biosimilars continues to be an area we\u2019re also excited about. We are seeing positive contributions from biosimilars. It just doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not at the level to be calling it out as necessarily the driver at this point in time. But it\u2019s something that we do continue to participate in. We\u2019re very well-positioned to be able to help manufacturers and customers with biosimilars, and we do see that as something that should be a tailwind for us, as we look forward, going forward. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, I think, in the Pharma segment, we\u2019re all just kind of looking at the trend line where the segment operating profits grew 1% year-over-year back in the fiscal first quarter, but then they were down 11% in here in fiscal 2Q. You mentioned that the nuclear pharmacy headwind was actually a little bit less in the December quarter. And I think you said in the Q&A that for the generic you\u2019re not seeing anything inconsistent there from what you saw on the prior quarter know, despite the COVID impact on generics. I guess, just the question is, is there anything else you\u2019d call out that may have gotten a little bit worse sequentially in that segment, or that just maybe there is something else that made the comp a little bit tougher in the December quarter that we overlooked? I just want to get more color on the decline in profits in fiscal 2Q versus in fiscal 1Q. Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes. As Mike mentioned earlier, we saw very consistent type of performance in a number of categories, sequentially Q1 to Q2. We talked about the COVID impact. We talked about generics in general, the consistent market dynamics. So, you do need to go back to look at the Q2 of the prior year, where -- that\u2019s where the generics program overall was fairly strong. And we talked at that point about not only volume, but some mixed impacts that were going on at that time. So, I think it\u2019s very much a comp as well as consistency within quarter to quarter sequentially. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Good morning. I think, I\u2019m going to ask about a different vector. In terms of your home health business, can you talk about how that has been performing in the quarter, and maybe sort of your expectations as we move through the rest of COVID and beyond? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. We continue to be very pleased with our at-home business. We\u2019re continuing to see growth in overall number of customers that we\u2019re serving, the types of product line that we\u2019re working with and driving our mix. All of those types of things getting after our cost structure. We are making some large investments in our IT systems that will be going online here. So, a little increased SG&A as we drive to improve our systems there to be able to improve the customer experience, and as we grow, be able to do it more effectively. But, it\u2019s a business that we continue to remain very positive on. We believe the trends are continuing to be in our favor in that business. And being one of the leaders in that space I think enables us to invest in various activities and opportunities to continue to grow that business. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Eugene Kim, Wolfe Research. Eugene Kim : Thank you, and good morning. I would love to get some color on cost savings benefit in the Medical segment. Can you maybe quantify the benefit you saw for the quarter and share how much of that savings are more temporary in nature? And also, if you are expecting those temporary savings to come back in the back half? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes. So, within the quarter, we called out two key items. One is this topic, cost savings as well as and the COVID impacts. And they were both the most significant items that are driving our year-over-year performance. So, in terms of the order of magnitude, you should think of that as a large driver of this performance and consistent with that other driver. How we break out our cost savings is that they would by their nature be largely permanent. Anything that\u2019s temporary, and only because of COVID or COVID-related matters, we would put into the COVID bucket. So, we do see this as continuous improvement and deepens our DNA, and that we aren\u2019t just squeezing out costs temporarily, but truly transformational, foundational elements. It\u2019s just within our SG&A expense, within our global manufacturing and our supply chain, and as such, we\u2019d expect it to be permanent. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is, as Jason mentioned earlier, remember that because of some of the strong performance we\u2019ve had in Medical and in the business in the first half, there are some areas in Medical expenses where we are investing in the business as we\u2019ve talked about from a capital standpoint. I just mentioned the IT business and the at-home, and we\u2019re also looking at some other areas. So, we are ramping up some of our expenses that in the area of making investments and growing the business over the mid to short-term. So, we would expect them to be a little higher in the second half. But to our $500 million five-year goal, those are seen as permanent expenses that come out. But, what we\u2019re talking about is ramping back up the type of investments based on how we feel strongly about the performance of the business for the full year. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Thanks and good morning. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about stockpile as a service or storage as a service in medical, and perhaps even in certain areas of pharma or therapeutics, mission-critical items that are often in short supply. I\u2019m just curious, it sounds like you\u2019re doing some similar things here. And I\u2019m curious what the model looks like with that business. Is this more like a 3PLC, or how exactly does that work? When does the customer buy the product from you? How are you compensated for the facilities, the capital costs, the storage, et cetera? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : I think, a couple things. First of all, the last thing you said is important is that we would intend to be properly compensated for that to make sure as with any investment or working with customers, to make sure that the services that we provide, we\u2019re getting compensated for not only from a income statement, but appropriately looking at our balance sheet and the return. So, that\u2019s important to know. To give you specifically on how it works, that\u2019s a little more complicated because I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to see inventory changes across the entire supply chain. I think, you\u2019re obviously, one, going to see some supply changes in the way the probably the manufacturers work, and the amount of inventory they\u2019re carrying to be able to get through these types of things. The location of our supply chain and where the percentage of what we self manufacturer versus what we source, we continue to increase our capacity, for instance, manufacture our own drapes and gowns. And so, the ability to ramp that up, store inventory and managing it that way would be one. And then, as I mentioned, we are building some larger distribution centers. So, we have the capacity to do that on our end, both to make sure our service levels are where our customers expect them to be, but also in certain cases, carry that inventory for customers. But, I also believe that customers are looking at what they warehouse and don\u2019t warehouse, and that makes them what they warehouse may mean more towards these PPE-related items versus other ones. And that can create some different opportunities for us to work with them. So, I do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years, as it relates to inventory. But, the important thing to note is that, as we work with our customers on this, we would -- and suppliers, we would expect to get compensated from both, in order to provide that type of service. Operator : Thank you. And, we will take our final question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut : Hey. Good morning, guys. Mike, just a question on the vaccine distribution side. I know you said you\u2019re taking care of small chain pharmacies and the independents. So, is there any sort of sizing that you can put there, or is this like what your clients are thinking in terms of the percentage of overall vaccinations that they will get as a group? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. At this point in time, as you know, it\u2019s state-by-state. It changes on a weekly basis. So, I don\u2019t really have any good insights on how to help you on that. I would tell you that we continue to be there for our customers. We\u2019re going to continue to help them be ready to do it. It\u2019s not a driver at all for our financial statements one way or the other. So, from a financial driver, it\u2019s not material. But, it\u2019d be really hard for me to even give you anything there because of the choppiness of the amount of vaccines that we\u2019re seeing, state by state. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I really want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And on behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I hope you and your families are safe and well. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again soon. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. Before I turn it over to Jason, I will provide a few high-level thoughts. We remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. With our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. In the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and PPE products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. Medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw our ongoing COVID-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. With this updated assumptions, we have revised our Pharma segment outlook. Despite the impacts of COVID-19, our business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and portfolio. As you saw in our recently announced agreement to sell the Cordis business. As we navigate the pandemic, our customer focus remains central to our activities. We deeply appreciate that it is our responsibility to serve health care providers, their patients and those on the front lines. Although the operating environment remains dynamic, it has reinforced our critical role in the supply chain. And it highlights opportunities for us to enhance our operations and evolve for future growth. I'll discuss some of the changes we are making later in my comments. But first I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason to provide additional details on our results and outlook. Jason Hollar : Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. Before I dive into the current quarter as a reminder, we are now comparing against a prior year quarter that included a benefit from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increase PPE demand due to the onset of COVID-19. Now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was in line with the prior year, consolidated gross margin for the period was $1.8 billion. SG&A decreased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprise-wide commitment to disciplined expense management. The net result for the quarter was operating earnings of $689 million, a decrease a 4%, 4% due to the impact of COVID-19, primarily concentrated in the Pharma segment. Adjusted for COVID-19, we estimate operating earnings would have grown mid-single digits in the quarter Moving below the line, interest and other income and expense, decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by multiple items, including an increase from the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, lower interest expense from prior period debt reduction and one-time investment gains. As we previously mentioned, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Average diluted shares outstanding were $294 million. Of note, during the quarter we repurchased $200 million of shares. Third quarter EPS was $1.53, which reflects an effective tax rate of 31.2%, approximately 5.5 percentage points above the prior year, due to the timing of discrete items. This includes adjustments for the resolution of all open issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 to 2010, as well as certain transfer pricing matters for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, which also impacted reserves for later years. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $277 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.8 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, and no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. Now for the segment results, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. Pharma segment revenue was flat at $35.1 billion. This reflects sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers compared against the previously mentioned COVID-19 related sales acceleration in the prior year. Segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to COVID-19 related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix. Excluding the volume impacts, our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. Additionally, we were encouraged to see our Nuclear business continue its recovery as we saw an improvement in volumes as we exited the quarter. In Specialty, we continue to see year-over-year growth and our excited about recent wins in our 3PL and Hub business. And the Pharma team remained focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong cost savings in the quarter. Now, I'm transitioning to Medical on slide six. Medical segment revenue increased 3% to $4.2 billion, driven primarily by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As in prior quarters, we saw higher selling prices and volumes and PPE, as well as higher volumes in our Lab business partially offset by lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures. Segment profit decreased 2% to $174 million. During the quarter cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies were offset by a decline in products and distribution. Additionally, segment profits experienced a slight net negative impact due to COVID-19, driven by the sell-through of PPE safety stock in the prior year. Now, let me step back to help frame our performance sequentially within the context of the previously discussed factors. During the third quarter, demand for surgical products used in elective procedures average approximately 90% of pre-COVID-19 levels compared to the 95% average in the prior quarter. We saw choppiness, especially early in the quarter, consistent with the evolution of the virus in various geographies. But as we exited the third quarter, collect the volumes rebounded back to around 95%. Our Lab business continued to experience a tailwind from increased demand for COVID-19 testing products. So, as expected, not quite at the peak level seen last quarter. Regarding PPE, we continue to see elevated volumes. In the quarter, we were successful in managing the significant cost increases that we've incurred to procure select PPE products. As we previously mentioned, many of our customers have chosen to leverage our supply assurance program to manage market uncertainties and we continue to expect timing variability, as we support our customers through this dynamic environment. Next, on slide eight, I will review updates to our fiscal 2021 outlook. Based on our performance to-date and increased visibility for the balance of the fiscal year, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to $5.90 to $6.05, which continues to reflect 10% EPS growth at the midpoint. We are making the following changes to our corporate assumptions. We now expect interest and other in the range of $145 million to $160 million, driven primarily by the deferred compensation favorability to-date, which as a reminder is all set above the line. We are narrowing our effective tax rate to 23.5% to 25%, reflecting the previously mentioned IRS resolutions. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares, which includes the repurchases completed during the quarter. Additionally, capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $400 million to $430 million. Moving to the segment outlooks on slide nine, we are updating our Pharma segment profit outlook to flat to down low single-digits due to updated expectations for COVID-19. Based on our third quarter exit rates and what we saw on April, we still expect brand pharmaceutical volumes to be at or near pre-COVID-19 levels as we exit the fiscal year, but we now expect the volume recovery of certain therapeutic classes within generics to extend into the end of calendar year 2021. As for the Medical segment, we continue to expect elective procedures to be at/or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, as well as segment profit growth in the low to mid 20s percentage range for fiscal 2021 With respect to the enterprise, we now expect COVID-19 to be a minimal net year-over-year driver. This guidance assumes a meaningful year-over-year COVID-19 headwind for the Pharma segment, and a similar tailwind for the Medical segments. Before I conclude, let me take a moment to provide an update on capital allocation. We continue to manage our portfolio, and the balance sheet in a prudent manner, consistent with our priorities, while at the same time driving improved financial flexibility. We expect the sale of Cordis to close in the first quarter of our fiscal 2022. This transaction, along with a previously announced tax receivable is expected to generate nearly $2 billion of incremental proceeds in the first half of our fiscal 2022. We expect to utilize these proceeds in a manner consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. With respect to our first priority, investing in the business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we continue to be excited by the projects implied. We expect this to remain our highest focus for capital deployment and to continue to prioritize investments in these areas. Regarding the balance sheet, as previously communicated, we expect to repay $1.4 billion of debt on/or before June 2022. Combined with prior repayments, this would represent a total debt reduction of nearly $5 billion over five years. While we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to reduce debt, we anticipate our future repayments will be more modest as we approach our leverage target. At the same time, we are committed to our dividend, which remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. With that in mind, our Board recently approved a 1% dividend increase for fiscal 2022. Outside of these three key priorities, we'll continue to evaluate tuck-in M&A within our strategic growth areas, an opportunistic share repurchases. As I mentioned, our improving financial flexibility enabled the deployment of capital for share repurchases during the third quarter. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Jason. As I mentioned earlier, the last year has highlighted certain opportunities for growth, transformation and innovation. And we're confident that our strategic direction will deliver both short and long-term success. In Pharma, we are excited about the mid to long-term trajectory of the segment. Our business model is resilient. We're expecting strong, long-term growth in key areas like specialty and nuclear, both of which are rebounding well from prior COVID related impacts. And we are executing a robust pipeline of initiatives and PD to support our customers, evolving needs. We also continue to invest in new technology solutions that enhance the customer experience and improved patient care. In specialty, our recently launched Navista Tech Solutions uses artificial intelligence to identify and match cancer patients to clinical trials. These insights enable oncologists to improve outcomes and reduce costs as they transition to value-based care. We are also offering digital solutions in the connected care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. Each year, medication non-adherence costs, the U.S. healthcare system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. With Outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. Outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth is positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence. As I look towards the future, I am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care. Turning to Medical, we continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. For example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. This includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns, and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own North American facilities. We are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the strategic national stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical PPE. We are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. We are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. We also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. For example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our Cardinal Health at Home and OptiFreight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions. By meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care. And in Medical Services, our OptiFreight Logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive health care logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. Together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. Along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprise-wide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization, and ESG priorities. We continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. For example, we are partnering with Four Kites, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time, so they can better serve their patients. Regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. We remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. We are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business. We also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. The pending sale of Cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. We are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities. Finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. We recently partnered with AEP to power our global headquarters and our National Logistics Center with clean energy, and we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day. To close, I want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities. With that, I'll pause to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I want to dive in a little bit to a comment you made about your expected growth on the EBIT ex COVID. I believe you said that would be mid-single digits. By my simple math, if you assume it's 5%, that gets you to roughly $66 million headwind versus the base line. So along those lines, can you break down a little bit within that area, what some of the biggest drivers were of the underperformance? And then in particular, with regards to that question and the generic volumes, any more color you can give us on some of the classes that you expect to continue to contribute to weakness over the next couple of quarters? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yeah, this is Jason. Let me start with your first question there. And your math is very accurate. That would represent right around $60 million of overall enterprise impact due to COVID. That is entirely in the Pharma segment. Within Medical, there was a very insignificant impact in the quarter due to COVID. Now there were a lot of moving pieces, pluses and minuses, but netted out for no significant impact within the quarter. As it relates to the Pharma business, that driver is driven by the generic volumes that Mike referenced in his comments and I referenced in my comments. And I think maybe, Mike, you can provide a little bit more color behind the second part of that question. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Michael, thanks for the question. And as it relates to the generics, remember, we have -- what we always talk about is our overall generics program and what we're seeing here in our overall generics program is that market dynamics are generally consistent. The only thing that has any real material impact on the program right now is generic volumes in certain therapeutic classes related to COVID-19, and it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the IQVIA data and the other data, there are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts, where we don't see those, getting back to pre-COVID levels prior to our fiscal year and we think as you know, kids get back to school, more people are unmasking, and all those types of things, we would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics returning to more of pre-COVID levels until the end of the calendar year. So, overall, again good market -- consistent market dynamics in the generic program really just focused on those few classes related to COVID. Jason Hollar : And I'd just like to add one more thing that $60 million, remember, there was a pull ahead last year. So, only about half of it is an adverse impact in the current year The other half is related to the comparison to the prior year. Michael Cherny : Got it. Thanks. Kevin Moran : Next question. Operator : And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. If I could follow-up on that. When you say certain therapeutic classes related to COVID, so are we talking like cold, cough, and flu like kind of flu and antibiotics, these kind of generic that might have been -- we're not seeing it because we had a weak flu season and you wouldn't expect that until maybe this coming flu season? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it's a great question, and I'll try to be helpful here. Yes, I would say flu season, as we know, has been light. But we've also said in the past, generally, if it were just flu season itself and just flu specific, like focused on just like a Tama flu in some of those, it wouldn't be that big of a driver. It would be a negative for us, but it wouldn't be probably a material driver that we would call out. But you said it well at the beginning; it's really the broader list of categories. So, it's antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and pain meds, those generics and those categories are what we're seeing that are -- have just not returned the pre-COVID levels. And if you look at the IQVIA data in these categories, what we're seeing both in our own data per, as you can imagine, a lot of conversations across the various classes of trade, it's very consistent in what we're seeing in terms of those volumes coming back. Charles Rhyee : Thanks. And if I could just follow-up real quick. Were we seeing these dynamics last quarter? And is it more that -- more of this was prescribed last year during COVID versus this year? And so that's what we -- or is it the depression that people haven't been going to the doctors and you don't see people still really going back to the doctor as much that that's driving this? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, it's hard to know for sure, but I'll give you a couple of thoughts. One is I think it is somewhat related to the physician office visits. Second of all, people are masking, social distancing, washing hands. You don't have the people playing like sports at the same level and all those things and having the injuries related to pain meds and all of those things. So, I think it's a combination of a lot of those things adding up. We've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories. And we've been saying since the beginning of the year, our assumption for guidance for both Pharma and the overall company has been about getting back to pre-COVID -- at or near pre-COVID levels by June 30. And it's good to know that we're seeing that in brand. We're still expecting that. We're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. Those are coming back. But we were hoping to see more of a ramp than these other ones. We're just not seeing it. So we believe that it's important not only through March, but we also looked at our April data. So it drove us to make a decision to change our Pharma guidance for this year. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Next question. Operator : We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yeah. Hi, good morning. So my question is still on generic about on pricing, clearly it's a big debate for investors now. So Mike, what are you seeing in terms of generic pricing, are you seeing accelerated deflation or any other trends, and also if you can talk a little bit about the sell, buy-side spread? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks, Ricky. Thanks for the question. As you know, it's really hard to get into individual components of the generics program, because as we've said for a while now, just calling out sell-side deflation without talking about the buy-side, the cost improvements or launches or overall volumes, it's -- you're really not giving a complete story. And that's why we've really been focused on just discussing how we see our overall generics program performing. And we really are seeing market dynamics are generally consistent with the only driver in the programs I just mentioned being COVID-related volumes in certain categories. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And a follow-up question there. When we think about the sell-side, I think we also need to think about contract renewals that could change dynamics. Are there any contract renewals either for your book of business or across the industry that either renewed recently or there are upcoming that you can point us to, if there any? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. As far as contract renewals go, on the ones that we specifically talk about our three largest ones, which we have disclosed, those still have a couple of years left on them before there's any renewals of those contracts. And everything else as it relates to contract renewals for this year is generally tracking as expected. It's always one of those headwinds as a year-over-year basis, but everything is tracking as we expected at the beginning of this year. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to move over to medical, Mike. Obviously, COVID has created a couple cross currents in that business as far as PPE and then the lack of utilization. Could you maybe just tell us where we are today as we think about those two broad buckets, the benefits that obviously you had and probably continue to see from PPE and testing versus the core business coming back as utilization starts to become more normal? Jason Hollar : Yes. This is Jason. Thanks for the question. I'll start. Within -- let's just step back from a COVID perspective overall for the medical business. As I mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to COVID, a lot of moving pieces, and I'll get into a couple of the key drivers. As a reminder, just like the Pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull-forward for PPE volume that we sold out of inventory we do have a slight negative year over year impact which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. So the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. And what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. So we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, we saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. But as I highlighted, it did improve at a tail end and back to the 90%. And that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. And so, we feel better about how we exited that quarter. And why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well, just that we expected to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. We did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. And that was an offset. And then we continue to see strong volumes with PPE. But again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. And we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with PPE. And those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the PPE products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated and anything else to add, Mike? Mike Kaufmann : No that sums it up well. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Hey, thanks good morning guys. So -- usually, when there is some negative supply/demand imbalance on commoditized products, it can impact price. So with the softer generic volume on those categories that you mentioned, the antibacterials, antibiotics, etcetera, I guess for me, I would just visualize that both the buy side and the sell-side pricing would maybe come down simultaneously on those products in conjunction with the softer Rx demand. I'm just curious if that's consistent with what you saw. I just want to confirm that one way or the other. So not to beat this topic to death, but just wanted to get some confirmation around that? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. That's a hard question to answer in the sense of the level of detail of looking at all of our -- both our buy side and sell side for all those individual categories. Nothing pops out to me related to that component of the driver. As I said, really, overall, the generic program market dynamics were generally consistent. It was more just a volume-related item on those categories. Nothing stands out in pricing, whether it be buy or sell that I would call out. Steven Valiquette : Okay. All right, thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Hey, thanks very much and good morning, Mike and Jason. Just really want to try to understand the puts and takes as we think about COVID going into 2022 from a comp perspective. Can you just remind us what the benefit or what the headwind has been for medical and pharmacy as we think about trying to model that going into next year? Mike Kaufmann : Sure. Yes. I can start and then turn it over to -- turn it over to Jason. As you know, our practice is that we're -- we're not -- we don't provide formal guidance on 2022 until August, but we'll try to give you a little bit of color to be helpful. I'll start with the fact that we still feel really good about our growth areas. So when we think about specialty, at home, nuclear, medical services and outcomes, we feel really good about all of these businesses. We think they all have strong industry trends, strong outlooks, complementary capabilities to our businesses and our -- we continue to adapt their offerings to focus on our customers' needs. So, I would say, we would still expect all of those growth areas to be positive drivers for next year. And then, let me have Jason give you a little bit of color on maybe a few of the other dynamics. Jason Hollar : Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And to enable -- let me just start with, to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. One thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased depreciation that we would expect to flow through. But, of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. Beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority, we have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. Getting into your question around COVID. That is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. As a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal 2020 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with COVID, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. Now this year, and then just in this -- today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a COVID perspective now in this update. So that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal 2021. Now the key question is, exactly how does that roll off down to 2022? And I would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes, nuclear to a similar extent. The brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. It's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal 2022. So there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. Now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with COVID. We would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like PPE and the lab business. But we also have the timing elements associated with PPE pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics, as we go forward. So when I think about the two different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact, we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business. And so, we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. And so they will behave then differently next year. And then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of Cordis. So we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter and we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. And so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal 2022. Lisa Gill : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Question on the Specialty business, It sounds like you're expecting that trend to normalizing in that business. I want to ask how the profitability levels have been running in that business, whether you're seeing benefits from biosimilars. And of late, there's been a call out of maybe some of the oral solid products that are more specialty generic and biosimilars. Are you participating in economics on those? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I would say there's nothing I would call out that's dramatically changing in our Specialty, particularly as it relates to the sales of drugs into the physician office space that we're seeing generally consistent profitability. We are participating in the various different opportunities in there, whether it be actual generics that are in Specialty, the biosimilars. We're participating in all of those activities. We're seeing increased volumes on certain key drugs. And as you know, we've been saying for a while, we have seen oncology come back more quickly than the other areas, but we do expect all the classes of the trade at this point in time within Specialty to be at or near pre-COVID levels by the end of our fiscal year. And then as it goes to our upstream services businesses like our 3PL, our hub and other businesses, those businesses continue to perform well and compete very effectively in the marketplace. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Jailendra Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jailendra Singh : Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could double click into manufacturing efficiencies you highlighted in the Medical segment. Can you provide some details there? And are any of those efficiencies in the Cordis business that will be rolling off versus your core business? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I mean we've clearly had manufacturing efficiencies in our Cordis business, like all of our manufacturing businesses. The team there has just done an excellent job across all of our 30 or more global manufacturing plants at driving efficiencies. There's nothing in particular about the Cordis efficiencies that would change the estimate that Jason just gave you that, that business, when it rolls off, hopefully, in our -- early in our first quarter of next year would have about a $60 million or $70 million earnings associated with it. Jailendra Singh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, you kind of alluded to this already, but have you been able to fully capture the pricing gap that occurred earlier this year as it related to PPE and supplies and the bed business? And I guess also, could you update us on the supply side as we think about your things like access to gloves and gowns to provide for your customers? And then I tack on at the end to relate to Jailendra's question, are there any dissynergies from the Cordis divestiture? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes. So, yes, we have captured the cost increases. The supply assurance program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. What I have referenced, I think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus when the price is recognized can be uncertain, can be relatively volatile and that\u2019s what we continue to look at and to manage. But the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. And then as it relates to -- I think your question was about access to the products. It continues to improve, but especially on the glove side, it's still constrained, but improving day-by-day. There's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. But especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market. As it relates to Cordis and any dissynergies, I wouldn't call it dissynergies. There are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs; there's things of that nature. But when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. We would not anticipate that there are other issues. In fact, I'd go the opposite way. Part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. And so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of a dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains. Mike Kaufmann : The only thing I would add to that, too, to be helpful is we have really invested in our overall own global manufacturing capabilities. And if you remember in my script, for instance, we're a large manufacturer of syringes. We've increased our capacity there by 15 million units on an annual basis. On gowns, we've added capacity to add 20 million-some manufacturers gowns a year. And our mask were at 150 million more masks a year annually; all in our own facilities, which are all either US or near US, they're all North American types of facilities. So, we've been done, I think, a very excellent job in the Medical segment of increasing our capacity and which what really, I think, strengthens our supply chain. And we've also invested in our sourcing capabilities and broadened our relationships with suppliers. So, we feel really good about some of the changes in developments we've made in our overall supply chain in Medical. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to the sort of the headwinds and tailwinds for fiscal 2022. If I'm sort of netting everything out, it sounds like COVID impact for Medical is going to be incremental -- like you considered an incremental negative. Did I think about that right? Can we just go through that one more time? Jason Hollar : Yes. For the Medical business, I would anticipate that the impact of COVID in the fiscal year, so not a year-over-year comparison, but just what's the impact of COVID will be a tailwind for this year. So, the question is, well, what are those same types of dynamics next year? Do we see more permanent longer-lasting PPE volumes, lab volumes? I've referenced the timing associated with the price and cost of PPE that could carry over into next year. But if it goes all -- if everything goes back to what a pre-COVID world looked like, it would imply a headwind. Of course, we expect there to be a more significant tailwind opportunity on the Pharma side, but specifically to the Med business, that's the right way to look at it. And just one thing to add additional color to where I'm sure you're trying to go with the question, is that when we think about our full year guidance of the low to mid-20s percentage growth, obviously, we have within that, some of that benefit I'm talking about. And just to be real clear, even if you back that out, we do have growth in the Medical business, but it is a key part of the growth that we're seeing this year as well. Kevin Caliendo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hoffman for closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And we and the entire Cardinal Health team hope you and your family stay safe and well, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Operator : And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Moran. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results, along with guidance for fiscal year 2022. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectation and yours, primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. This reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to COVID-19 on certain highly commoditized PPE products. To meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain PPE categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices, and longer than normal supply chains. Our analysis at the quarter-end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory. In addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which Jason will cover in his remarks. Throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. For example, we divested the Cordis business, extended our Red Oak Sourcing agreement with CVS Health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability, and made important leadership changes. We are continually reviewing our business, and seeking areas to improve. With the actions we've taken to date, and our plans for FY'22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation. In FY'21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year, and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to COVID-19, we grew EPS. We continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure, and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. We generated strong operating cash flow; prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet. As I reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients, and further improve the resiliency of our supply chain. Before turning it over to Jason, I want to highlight last week's announcement, that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. This is an important step forward for our company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe a settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary relief for our community, and certainty for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to further discuss our results and FY'22 guidance. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we delivered EPS of $0.77, which as Mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain PPE in the Medical segment. Turning to the Pharma segment, on slide six, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. As a reminder, the fourth quarter fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to COVID-19, which to a lesser extent contributed to the growth in the quarter. Pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter, at $358 million. This reflects COVID-19 related volume recovery in our nuclear business, offset by pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. This impact in renewals was in line with our expectations, and generally consistent with prior quarters. However, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that are higher than previously assumed. As we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. In the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements results in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities. I will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22. As we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. Our generics program continue to see generally consistent market dynamics. With respect to other product types, including brand, specialty, and consume health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter. In Medical, depicted on slide seven, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution primarily due to a recovery in elected procedure volumes, and a positive PPE pricing impact. Medical segment loss, of $63 million in the fourth quarter, was due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elected procedure volumes. Additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see elected procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-COVID-19 levels. While our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor, and commodities. We are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts, but as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year. Now, I'll turn your attention to full-year results, beginning with the enterprise. Total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion, with strong top line growth in both segments. Consolidated gross margin decreased 2%, to $6.8 billion. Despite sales growth, SG&A decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to COVID-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. Including COVID-19 operating earnings would have grown in the low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Moving below line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increasing the value of our deferred compensation plan and one-time investment gains. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported an interest in other are fully offset in corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8% benefiting from discrete items. We finished the year with EPS of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net COVID-19 headwind. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to operate with high networking capital efficiency generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full-year. We finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends effects point in time cash flows. We continued to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business and CapEx to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet through approximately $550 million in debt pay down, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As for the segments full-year results, beginning with Pharma on slide 10, Pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 million driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. Pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. Excluding COVID-19, we estimate the Pharma segment would have grown low-single digits in fiscal 2021. Turning to Medical on slide 11, full-year Medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion driven by a net positive impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. As we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of PPE sales and higher volumes in our lab business. Medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from COVID-19 on products and distribution. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain PPE products, partially offset by higher volumes in our lab business. Additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings with putting global manufacturing efficiencies on the year. When adjusting for COVID-19 related impacts in Medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full-year. While our fiscal 2021 results fell short of our expectations. The underline growth we saw in both segments, excluding COVID-19 is this competence as we move into next year and the pandemics effects on our businesses continue to dissipate. Turning to our guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. This reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth in efficiencies across the enterprise, the Cordis divestiture and other assumptions by we will detail momentarily. We expect interest in other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. We anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase or the prior year, primarily result of the fiscal 2021 capability in deferred compensation, not expected to repeat. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. We expect alluded weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million and CapEx of $400 million to $450 million. Transitioning to the segments beginning with Pharma on slide 14, we expect high-single digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued COVID-19 recovery and mid-single digit segment profit growth. We anticipate COVID-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to Pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. While we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year. As mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal 2022, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the COVID-19 related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see Pharma normalized growth in the low-to-mid single digit range. We believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long range growth trajectory of the business. As for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics and our generics program. We expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. We anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued left dollar contribution each year. And we expect opioid related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21. For Medical on slide 15, we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year COVID-19 comparison with low double-digits segment profit growth. With respect to COVID-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to Medical segment profit. We are assuming elective procedures will remain at or near pre-COVID levels for the duration of the year. We expect modern headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher costs PPE products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. And we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the PPE inventory reserve. Outside of COVID-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact segment profit due to the Cordis divestiture. Note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to the exchange rate capability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year. Additionally, we expected investment incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-home business to drive growth and efficiencies. Adjusting for these items, we see normalized medical segment profit growth of mid-to-high single digits in fiscal '22. Finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain costs to persist, particularly in the first-half of the year. We anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year. Now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year, we expect profit growth to be significantly back halfway to in both segments. In Pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted towards the front half, as well as stronger expected second-half performance in our generics program including the impact of COVID-19. In Medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 COVID-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first-half of the year. As a reminder, we also experienced favorable COVID-19 impact in the first-half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude. Throughout the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation, as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder friendly manner. Our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. Along those lines, we anticipate deploying the Cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paid down, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. We expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. In addition, we expect total debt pay down of approximately $850 million reflecting the completion of the remaining June 2022 dead tower at or before maturity. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. To be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward with a sense of urgency to improve our operation and execute our strategy. We're prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double-digit growth as FY'22. And across our business, we're enhancing our IT infrastructure in key areas to increase capabilities and digitization that improve the customer experience and drive productivity. While we expect the benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize and FY'23 and beyond. In Pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights, and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers. Our generics program remains a critical priority. This week, we extended our Red Oak agreement with CVS Health for an additional five years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through June 30, 2029. This ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. We are also investing in data and analytics including our pricing capabilities, as we continue to focus on managing all components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years. We remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community, and our recent annual retail business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched two new digital offering, NavixRx and E-Commerce Storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve healthcare outcomes. In Specialty, we're investing in our Sonexus patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And then our third party logistics business, we're extending our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies. In Nuclear, we received FDA approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent, LYMPHOSEEK in pediatric patients one-month and older. We continue to build out our multi-million dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis, and are also investing to expand our pet capabilities. We expect double-digit profit growth in nuclear over the next several years, and in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct to patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs. Turning to Medical, we've been taking quick decisive action throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our medical business. And this work remains a top priority heading into FY'22. We've recently restructured our organization to establish clear lines of ownership and accountability and made some management changes including appointing a single leader to manage U.S. medical products and distribution as well as the single leader to manage international. With the divestiture of quarter, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit. So we can focus on locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth. We're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients. In addition, our medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. Our at-home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. We continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. For FY'22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility. With respect to the enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. In FY'22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by FY'23. As Jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced disciplined and shareholder friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for Cardinal Health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day. And now, Jason and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. I want to dive a little bit more into the capital deployment priorities you think about into '22. Obviously, you have the Cordis proceeds that are coming in of [$1 billion] [Ph], I believe the [indiscernible] agreement, if I recall, is about $1 billion or so, and I could double-check that in the last quarter's transcript. When you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive, either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market, on M&A, given that you talked about a number of growth priorities, of which I assume there's some bolt-on transactions. Just curious about that philosophy, where you sit now, given that the company is in as strong a balance sheet position as I can recall seeing in a while? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. And we are really excited about the work we've done around that. But I'm going to have Jason give you a little bit more color on it. Jason Hollar : Yes, thanks, Mike. And first of all, yes, I think we had some really great cash flow this last year, so $2.4 billion of operating cash flow. And that resulted in $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. So, as you indicated perfectly, we're stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the Cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago. We're still to add another $1 billion to that balance. As we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to pay down the $815 million that's coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. So that will be some of those uses. And then, of course, we guided towards the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range, and reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about. And as I think about the Cordis proceeds, of course cash is somewhat fungible, but essentially that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown, and a portion of that $500 million to $1 billion. So, we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. You referenced the tax receivable, and I don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. The last quarter, I'd referenced that we expect it by the end of the calendar year. It's still our expectation, like I think a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now; I think COVID has impacted some of the processes, and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. But we still feel pretty good that that's a good approximate timeframe. But when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. So, it's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher end of that range. But, nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that. As you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially we have increased flexibility here. M&A is always on that list, and it depends on the opportunity, the valuation, and what we see delivering to us strategically. And so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year. Thanks for question. Operator : Up next, we'll hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Great, thanks. I just want to expand on that a little bit. I guess I don't understand why you're not being more aggressive with the buybacks. Given the settlement, looks like it's largely done, the cash on hand is greater, the stock is going to come under pretty meaningful pressure today, most likely. What's stopping you from going out and buying $2 billion of stock or more? I mean are there any credit issues or anything else that you're concerned about? And also, on the buyback, if I'm doing the math right, it feels like the numbers don't entirely jive to get to that $0.21. Is there -- is it just simply the timing that it would happen so late in the year is why the buyback wouldn't cover the sort of $0.21 of dilution from Cordis? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, let me start, Kevin. And then I'll turn it back over to Jason. I'll just comment specifically on the opioid piece, and then let Jason give you a little bit more information. The opioid, as we said, we're pleased to get to the point where we right now, where we have a comprehensive settlement out there. But it does have a few more steps left in it. So, we do have to wait and see if we get the states, and cities, and counties to sign on to get enough critical mass in order to make a final decision. And so, we do have some time left on that to make sure we understand exactly with clarity where that's going to be. But we're pleased with where we are as far as an initial step of finally getting something out there for people to consider. And then let me now turn it over to Jason to go into a little bit more the other detail that you asked about. Jason Hollar : Yes, and as it relates to the [indiscernible] on the Cordis that was implied or referenced within there, it's just a matter of the timing of which you assume when we pay down the debt and when we would complete the share repurchases. And so, there's an opportunity for that to have a reasonable range. And that that guidance range, we think, reflects what we think that possibility may be. And -- but the key thing, on a pro forma basis, is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. And we will see, and certainly within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected that divestiture. And as it relates to the [the other] [Ph] question, and somewhat as it relates to credit issues, there's nothing there. I mean, we're on a guidance -- a glide path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. A key part that I referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's come due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us towards those targets. And I indicated, last quarter, that I would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. That continues to be our expectation. There's a lot of factors, as Mike just referenced, that would play into that. But overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, I'll say, overly constrictive from that point. Just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. And we also need to see underlying performance in cash flow over the course of the year. And then, as I mentioned before, we do have some additional flexibility as it relates to the precise timing of the tax receivable. Operator : And up next, we will take a question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jailendra Singh : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I want to go back to your just inventory impact on PPE in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more what products this relates to? And is there a potential that you might have another write-down in fiscal '22, and what kind of initiatives you're putting in place to ensure that this does not happen again? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes, so I'll go and start it and -- so, as Mike mentioned, the key thing here is there's been a lot of uncertainties with the pandemic. And we were first and foremost going to put our customer commitments in front of us. And that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period time. And that happened while there was; obviously, increasing demand, higher prices, and longer than normal types of supply chains. And then we step back, at every quarter we step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is, and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. So, as Mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products, so [indiscernible] is a subset of our PPE, that think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. We saw that move more dramatically over the period. And given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. It was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset. And again, we're not getting into all the details product by product, but it was that type of product that had a little bit of the value add, and therefore as a little bit easier to get more supply into the market, and that drove the prices down quicker than other products. Anything else to add, Mike? Mike Kaufmann : Only, I'd reiterate that our focus has always been and will continue to be on our customer. And it was important to, us from the very beginning of this pandemic, to acquire critical PPE for our customers. And as Jason says, we did ramp up during a period of higher demand and higher prices, and longer supply chains. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : And next, we will hear from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning. And thanks for all the details you provided in the prepared remarks. Just a couple of follow-up questions to understand sort of the moving parts into guidance, so specifically, you talked about the customer renewal, seems like it's CVS, can you maybe help us quantify what the impact is in 2022, and also is there any other renewals that we should be considering in the next 12 to 18 months? And then, the second question in terms of the moving parts are on the investment that you're making, should we think about them as sort of a one-time investment in 2022, or should we now factor just kind of like ongoing resource of investments to support future growth? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, I'll start talk about the renewals, and then I'll have Jason make a comment on the investment. The renewal that we're talking about at the Red Oak renewal is not at all included in what Jason was talking about on customer renewals. That's considered in our overall generics program performance, which we expect to be something that we would expect to be a tailwind next year. We feel really good about where we're headed with all the various components of our generics program and excited to continue to partner with CVS moving forward with on Red Oak. What Jason was talking about in renewals was just the normal renewals. There is nothing unexpected in the fourth quarter customer renewals, they basically came in as planned, and so that was not anything I would consider it as we look for. We don't see customer goals being any different or unusual for us in FY'22. Jason Hollar : Yes. It's relates to the other moving pieces for Pharma that are a part of that underlying guidance. Our growth businesses we expect to contribute. As Mike mentioned, we expect double-digit growth for our growth businesses top line as well as bottom line, and for the Pharma business that would be of course specialty nuclear and outcomes. And then we have the year-over-year COVID benefit that I mentioned would be a key part of that. But as Mike mentioned that the customer renewals is not something that we would anticipate to be significantly different year-over-year. And then your question regarding investments, those investments are next year of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these IT systems in place. We are finalizing a multi-year journey now, and are starting to depreciate those assets. So there will be elevated appreciation that of course is more fixed in nature, but there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of the system tends to be more expensive versus capital. And so, as we're riding that roll out stage that expense will be elevated. And that far we would expect to reduce longer term certainly beyond fiscal '22, but for the balance of this year, we would expect it to be elevated and then thereafter some portion of that will come down later on. Kevin Moran : Next question? Operator : And up next, we'll hear from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the generic volume commentary around certain classes. I know that we saw a clear increase in acute volumes from March into April on the quarter. So what are the classes where you're seeing this and any other specifics on how that's impacting the generic program? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, thanks for the question. So, a couple things on that, we did see some sequential growth from Q3 to Q4 on generic volumes. So that continues to be a positive sign. We do expect our impact from COVID-19 on all generic volumes to be back at pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year or by the end of our Q2. What we're referring to here is, we're still seeing again ramping up, but we're still seeing some less than pre-COVID volumes on areas like anti-infectives, antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals, and some pain medications that we've not seen. Our thoughts are as life continues to get more and more back to normal if that's the right word, kids are back in school, et cetera. We would start to see those drugs being needed more than they probably have historically been needed. So again, expect them to be back to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, but that's really what we're talking about. Very similar to the exact same thing we talked about last quarter. And it's kind of continuing to play out as we should back then. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : And next we'll hear from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : [Technical difficulty] -- The categories that are trending above baseline, I'm curious if you're seeing those same trends as well. Thanks. Kevin Moran : Mr. Valiquette? Mike Kaufmann : I'm sorry. We didn't catch the beginning of your question. So if you could try it again. Thank you. Steven Valiquette : Yes. So I knew at some point it would happen. I would get paying to ask two questions on two calls at the same time. That just happened. So, I guess I'm curious to -- curious to if you could provide more color on the elevated supply chain costs, you mentioned for the Medical segment and fiscal 4Q, you cited that in the press release. I guess I'm curious geographically is this cost pressure mainly in the U.S. or the international as well, in addition to some other color, just that mechanically what's happening there and that's a sale of Cordis alleviate this in any way into a fiscal 2022. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks. I'll start with your second piece first. Really, I don't see Cordis alleviating that at least towards the -- what the guidance we said, of course, there could have been a elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products and Cordis being more international. Obviously it had more aspects, potential fluctuation, but don't see Cordis being a factor there. As far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is I think what you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs. We're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be three to 10x. What they cost to should have been prior to COVID just due to where it's being blocked things like that. So we're just wages, et cetera. So it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. Again, saw that in Q4, we expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. And then as we think things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through the customers, if it's a more permanent type of thing. So we'll be monitoring that and keeping our eyes on that. Operator : All right, and our next question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Eduardo Mestre : Hi, good morning. This is Eduardo on for Elizabeth. Can you guys maybe provide some more color on the $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities? And I guess what areas of the enterprise they expect to generate those savings from? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes, I would say it's very much continuation of what we've done to date, as you certainly recall our initial target was the $500 million and we've come close to accomplishing that after the -- just the first three years. And that was in varied areas everywhere from manufacturing, our footprint worked there to our distribution work all the way up to our functional areas. As we go forward, what we're seeing this next stage is the ability to go from more of the transactional first order benefits of like rate negotiation in areas like transportation and going further into really redesigning networks and getting into more augmented intelligence and things of that nature. We have one area that is allowing us to unlock additional value in this next stage is the Cordis divestiture. We talked about the simplification of our international operating structure. That's a -- that's an enabler for us to continue to go after additional opportunities there and then just continue on and all fronts given that we've got good momentum in place already for the existing initiatives. Mike Kaufmann : Only thing I would add is that just to emphasize something Jason mentioned is around the use of digital to really get after being able to use bots, AI, RPA, et cetera, to get after our cost structure. We've been investing a lot of time on that. Our IT team has done a nice job of building out both people, resources and our businesses and functions are all embracing this as well as making sure we're doing work in the right locations are all other important factors that we see being able to give us some tailwinds going forward and cost savings. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : And next we'll hear from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks so much. Good morning. I just really want to understand as we think about normalization in your Pharma segment, so beyond the renewal. Do you see low-single digit to mid-single digit normalization in Pharma segment profits growth over the longer term, and where are our specific opportunity that you see to maybe further accelerate that growth beyond 2022 at that'd be kind of my first question, and do things like specialty and nuclear that you talk about returning to double-digit. I know they're on the smaller side. Did they help to accelerate that, that low-single digit to mid-single digit normalization? Just any drivers or help you can get around that on a longer-term basis. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks, Lisa. Appreciate it. Actually you hit a lot of it right there in your question is that we did want to provide a normalized growth so that we could share with you what we do believe are achievable longer-term growth rates for both of the businesses that we provided the normalized growth on, specifically the Pharma, I think you said it well, we do expect continued double-digit growth from nuclear and specialty in our outcomes businesses. We see all of them next year being able to grow the top and bottom lines by double-digits. And we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. So, as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment obviously they're going to continue to have more and more impact. We feel really good about the pipeline of products in nuclear and what the work we're doing in our -- the center for advancement of Theranostics. We already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in that center when we opened it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. So we feel good about all of those businesses. And then, as far as the core PD business goes, we think we are well-positioned with some very large and important customers that, that you're aware of. We've got eight more years now on our agreement related to Red Oak, and we feel good about that partnership and that continued positive impact on our generics program. And so those are some of the things I would say, make us feel good about that growth going forward. Kevin Moran : Next question please. Operator : And next we'll hear from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Mike first, I would ask you, with the renewal of the Red Oak agreement, are there any substantive changes to the economics of that agreement? And then number two, you guys called out contingent brand inflation in the pressure -- I'm sorry, in the presentation as the business is starting to mix back towards brand growth. Are you seeing any changes in the underlying economics of the brand relationships and the amount of profits exposed to our brand price inflation? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Two very good questions, so first of all, on brand, what we're seeing there is we're expecting overall inflation rates to just be similar to the last couple of years. So we're not seeing any real changes there. And that's as Jason mentioned, the reason he said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to non-contingent and we've renegotiated a couple of those DSAs over the last year, so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation. As far as overall rates go, I would say we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. We have very strong relationships with manufacturers. And as you know, when anytime there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out. And sometimes they need to pay more fees when they loosen and say high priced item to a patent expiration. And so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturer partners and continue to have what I consider to be a fair market rate for that, and feel very good about that being able to be something that we can continue going forward. As far as the Red Oak renewal, we won't be able to get into any specifics there, but as you can imagine, it's been an excellent seven-year relationship. The team there continues to remain intact. They have decades generic buying experience. The leadership there in the team has just a great group of individuals again with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market, to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. And we continue to partner well with CVS at Board Meetings, et cetera, to continue to drive that. So we feel that the both companies took into in the context, on the market conditions on generics, then we renegotiate it and we feel very good about where we are with our Red Oak extension. Take one last question. Operator : And the last question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe Mike, maybe a question on opioids in the settlement here, and I think there's like 150 days or so that for the plaintiffs to accept the terms of the settlement. What's the minimum participation that's required under this settlement for it to go into effect? So in other words, is it like half the participants have to at least participate and then it's my understanding that the amount that you would pay out would scale down depending on the number of participants. So just wondered what that minimum requirement is. And then what happens if you don't hit that threshold. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question. So you're right. And so the total number that is accrued assumes all 50 states, cities and counties are in. So if any single state or cities and counties within states do not elect to be part of it. The number will come down based on agreed upon proration by states. So it will decline that states not -- and cities and counties do not participate. Second thing to your point, it is multi-steps, there's a point where we get some insights to where the states are. Then there'll be another point where we'll get to understand what about cities and counties and the subdivisions are. And after all of that, we will take a look at what we'll call -- we're calling critical mass. There is no set number. So there's no minimum. Our goal has been and continues to be to get 100% participation on all 50 states in order to have the most clarity, that may not happen in anything less than that, then we as a group, we'll have to sit down and determine if that's enough clarity and participation. It's highly dependent on the states that do and don't participate. So we'll have to really step back and look at it as an overall -- from an overall standpoint, and make a decision on whether or not to move forward. Jason Hollar : One thing I'd like to just clarify, as Mike indicated, if not all 50 states choose, or we come to an arrangement to join that would mean the cash payments would be lower under that structure. It does not necessarily mean the accrual would change. And that would we look at the facts and circumstances of the situation is determined what their proper accounting would be at that time. There could certainly be a difference there that we would need to evaluate. Mike Kaufmann : Good clarification. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the conference back to Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call and for the very helpful questions. I know there was a lot of noise in this quarter, but I just wanted to end with a few thoughts to keep in mind. We did see -- first, we did see underlying growth in FY 2021 in both of our segments, if you exclude COVID-19, which gives us confidence as we move forward -- going forward with the impacts of the pandemic, hopefully beginning to dissipate. Our guidance is for growth next year in each segment. And also if you take normalized growth in each segment, when you normalize for noise, like COVID and Cordis divestiture, we will grow in both segments. We have tailwinds behind our growth businesses. We really expect all of our growth businesses as a group to really grow at least double-digits on the top and bottom line. And we have taken some significant actions such as getting after an additional $250 million in cost savings, closing the Cordis transaction, which will enable us to simplify our operating model and extending our agreement with CVS or just a few of the examples, and it's the first question was in Jason's comment, we do have very strong cash flow generation, which gives us a lot of flexibility to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. So with that, thanks again, and have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today we will discuss Cardinal Health First Quarter Fiscal 2022 results. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call. We please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thank you, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations. As we continue to manage through the global pandemic, we're staying focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. In Pharma we continue to see sequential volume improvement, and are encouraged by the profit growth that we saw in the first quarter. We believe our Pharma business, inclusive of our strategic growth areas of specialty, nuclear and outcomes is well-positioned for growth in FY\u201922 and beyond. Our Medical segment continues to be impacted by the disruptions in the global supply chain that we called out last quarter. Recently, these pressures have rapidly escalated, and we are experiencing significantly elevated product costs due to international freight and commodities. While we believe the majority of these elevated supply chain costs are temporary, we do not expect them to return to normalized levels this fiscal year. As a result, we are lowering our FY\u201922 outlook for Medical segment profit to adjust for these increased headwinds. We are taking actions to mitigate these impacts across the enterprise. And we're reaffirming our FY\u201922 EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. We have been on a journey to simplify our portfolio and strengthen our core businesses, so we are positioned for broad-based sustainable growth as noted in the long-term targets we are announcing today. We are prioritizing investment in our strategic growth areas, and in innovative solutions to meet our customers needs today and tomorrow. And with our improved balance sheet, commitment to our dividend, and now an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy.  Now, I'll turn it over to Jason to discuss our results. Jason Hollar : Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. I will review our first-quarter results and updated expectations for fiscal '22 before closing with some comments on capital deployment. Beginning with total Company results, first quarter revenue increased 13% to $44 billion driven by sales growth from existing customers. Total gross margin decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by the Cordis divestiture and the net impact of elevated supply chain costs in Medical. As a reminder, the sale of Cordis was completed in August second and impacted the quarter's results by approximately two months. SG&A increased 1% reflecting information technology investments in higher costs to support sales growth, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Overall, first quarter operating earnings track in line with our expectations, down 15%. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $2 million driven primarily by lower interest expense from continued debt reduction actions. During the first quarter, we exercised a make-whole call provision to redeem $572 million with outstanding June 2022, debt maturities. We continue to expect to repay the approximately $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes upon maturity. Our first quarter effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 289 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the prior year. This reflects prior year share repurchases, as well as the $500 million share repurchase program initiated in the first quarter and recently completed. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.29. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. This cash balance also reflects our first annual settlement payment into escrow under the proposed opioid settlement agreement.  Now, turning to the segments beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 13% to $40 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Segment profit grew 1% to $406 million, which reflects an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by COVID-19. This was largely offset by investments in information technology enhancements. As a reminder, last quarter we began deploying new technology platforms across our Pharmaceutical Distribution business as a part of a multi-year journey to enhance our IT infrastructure. This rollout is tracking according to plan, and we continue to expect incremental implementation and depreciation costs through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '22. As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we saw broad-based sequential improvement in pharmaceutical demand, including generics. We continue to expect a recovery in generic volumes to pre-Covid levels by the end of the calendar year. Outside the volumes, our generics program continue to experience generally consistent market dynamics along with strong performance from Red Oak. And during the quarter, Pharma saw double-digit contributions from our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear, and outcomes. Transitioning to the Medical segment on Slide 6, Medical revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion driven primarily by PPE sales, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture. Segment profit decreased 46% to $123 million, primarily due to elevated supply chain costs. To a lesser extent, this also reflects the impact of the Cordis divestiture, as well as net favorability in the prior year attributed to COVID-19. As Mike mentioned, Medical segment profit was negatively impacted by increased product costs due to significant inflationary pressures in our global supply chain, particularly in the areas of commodities and international freight. In commodities, we have seen spikes in some key resins, such as polypropylene, that are inputs into our self-manufactured and source products, with recent index prices nearly double where they were last year. And with international freight, we're seeing ocean container costs at roughly 8 to 10 times pre -COVID levels. We believe the majority of these headwinds are temporary, but we do not expect them to abate this fiscal year. We are taking action, including through pricing and aggressive cost management. I will discuss these impacts to our full-year medical outlook look shortly. To wrap up the quarter, despite some impact from the Delta variant on elective procedure volumes, overall, our customers continue to manage effectively and total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre-Covid levels. Additionally, lab testing volumes remained significantly elevated above pre-Covid levels, but was not a material driver to the quarter due to the strong performance in the prior year.  Next on slide eight, a few updates to our fiscal 22 outlook. We are reiterating our EPS guidance range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. This reflects updated expectations for the Medical segment, as well as lower ranges for our tax rate and share count. We now expect our annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We also now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 280 million to 282 million.  As for the segment outlooks on Slide 9, first we are adjusting our Pharma revenue outlook to low double-digit growth to reflect the strong branded pharmaceutical sales growth that we're seeing from large customers. For medical, we now expect fiscal '22 segment profit to be down mid-single to low double-digits. This change is driven by the significant increases in supply chain costs inflation that I previously discussed, which is expected to result in an incremental net headwind of approximately $100 to $125 million on the year. Given the anticipated timing of realizing these cost increases and our mitigating actions, as well as the timing of selling higher cost PPE, we expect a sequential decline in medical segment [Indiscernible] Stepping back, the only large operational item that we see meaningfully different today compared to our original fiscal '22 guidance is the incremental impact of elevated supply chain costs [Indiscernible] medical. Notably, we do not anticipate any material net impact in Pharma from inflationary supply chain costs. And as noted last quarter, we still expect the cadence of our EPS guidance to be significantly back-half weighted. Now to close, an update on capital deployment. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner, and we'll continue to allocate capital through the lens of our priorities, which are unchanged. We have been on a journey to improve our balance sheet and our portfolio, and have made tremendous progress. As we look forward, we see our debt paydown beginning to moderate, which will provide an increased ability to be more opportunistic with our return of capital to shareholders. On that note, 2 important updates. Our board recently approved a new three-year authorization to repurchase up to an additional $3 billion of our common stock, expiring at the end of calendar year 2024. And we now expect approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in fiscal 22, which includes the $500 million of share repurchases executed to date. We believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will be a key driver to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we're targeting in the long term. With that, turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Jason. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded to challenges with resilience and agility, approaching every situation with a focus of delivering for our customers. So they can care for their patients. We're continuing reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve as we navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. We are taking action to mitigate elevated costs and manage through temporary supply chain disruptions in medical. These actions include pricing, adjustments, cutting additional costs throughout the organization and accelerating additional growth opportunities. Outside of a continual focus on the customer, we are directing our efforts to 3 main areas that will support our long-term target of mid single to high single-digit growth for the medical segment. First, we are simplifying our operating model. We continue to take decisive action to reposition the business for growth. We divested the Cordis business, and have begun significantly reducing our international commercial footprint. We have announced and are in the process of exiting 36 initial market, which will allow us to focus on the markets where we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, we are further streamlining our medical manufacturing footprint and modernizing our distribution facilities. We expect these simplification initiatives to contribute to our $750 million enterprise cost savings target, and position us to generate sustained long-term growth. Second, we are focused on driving mix through commercial excellence. Our Cardinal brand portfolio has significant breath, with leading brands and clinically differentiated products such as Kendall Compression, Kangaroo Enteral Feeding, and Protexis surgical gloves, among others. While we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives, we recognized that we are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential. An increase in private label penetration across the U.S. in in-channel customer base, represents a significant profit opportunity, with even further opportunities out of channel than internationally. As we move past the pandemic, we see this as a significant opportunity to both deliver savings for our customers and grow our business over the mid to long term. And third, work fueling our medical segment growth businesses. At-Home Solutions and medical services, which includes OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark. These growth businesses are aligned with industry trends and positioned to capture market share and growth double-digits in FY'22 and beyond. We continue to invest in technology enhancements and innovative solutions that give our businesses a competitive edge. In OptiFreight, we continue to expand our customer base and offerings. And in At Home Solutions, which is now a $2.2 billion business. We continue to see volume growth as scare is rapidly shifting to the home. We are investing in new technologies to drive operational efficiencies and enhanced data visibility. Moving to Pharma. We have 2 primary objectives to achieve our long-term guidance of low to mid-single digit segment growth. Continuing to strengthen our core Pharma Distribution business, and fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear, and Outcomes. We will continue to strengthen our core business by focusing in 3 primary areas. First, supporting our diverse customer base. Over 50 years, we've honed our distribution expertise, and developed a strong customer base across multiple classes of trade with leaders in chain pharmacy, direct mail order, grocery, and retail independent customers, all of whom play critical roles in providing health care access to their local communities. Along those lines. During the quarter, we extended our distribution agreements with CVS Health through FY 27. Second, we're managing our generics program to ensure consistent dynamics, which we continue to see and expect. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY 29. Third, we've been investing heavily in our technology to enhance customer experience and drive efficiencies. We are approaching the end of a multi-year investment journey to modernize our IT infrastructure, which will yield meaningful working capital improvements and operational efficiencies. As for our second overall Pharma objective, fueling our growth businesses. We continue to expect these 3 businesses to realize double-digit growth over the next several years. And as these businesses grow, it will become a bigger portion of the overall Pharma segment. In Specialty, key downstream and upstream initiatives will enable our growth. In Oncology, we're competing differently downstream by transforming from a distribution lab orientation to a focus on supporting independent oncology practices with solutions to thrive in a value-based care environment. We're seeing commercial momentum with Navista TS, our technology platform that helps oncology practices improve their performance in value-based care. We have a strong presence in other therapeutic areas, such as rheumatology, which today is a $4 billion distribution market growing double-digit. We're also encouraged by the anticipated growth biosimilars as more products come to market, such as the FDA approval for the first interchangeable bio similar insulin product. We're well-positioned to support the next phase of biosimilar growth as adoption increases in areas outside of oncology. Upstream, we are expecting strong growth from higher-margin services supporting biopharma manufacturers. We operate a leading 3PL supporting hundreds of manufacturers that continues to see wins, and support new products coming to market, such as in the area of cell and gene therapy. The nuclear, we are expecting continued double-digit profit growth, resulting in a doubling of our processes in this business by FY 26. We continue to build up our multi-million-dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis and are investing to expand our pack capabilities. We're partnering with several companies to grow the pipeline of novel Theranostics. For example, through our agreement with TerraPower, we will produce and distribute Actinium-225, a radionuclide involved in creating targeted therapies for several cancer types. And in outcomes, we continue to see and expect strong growth. This business has added new payers and PBMs, and is expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains to include solutions for medical billing, point-of-care testing, and other clinical capabilities. With respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently increased our total cost reduction goal to $750 million by FY2023, and we are on track to deliver those savings. We're paring cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation, with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. Long-term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend, and our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now, let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. In September, we announced that enough states agreed to settle to proceed to the next phase, and each participating state is offering its political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement for an additional 120 day period, which ends on January 2nd, 2022. At that point, each of the distributors and the states will have the opportunity to determine whether there is a sufficient participation to proceed with the agreement. If all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in a settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our Company. As we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic, and believe the settlement would provide relief for our communities and certainty for our shareholders. Turning to ESG, these priorities remain critical to achieving a healthier, more sustainable world. We recently announced goals to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and increase minority representation in our global workforce by 2030. In closing, what we do matters. And it is our privilege to serve our customers, their patients, and their communities around the world. And now, Jason, I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you [Indiscernible] [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for a moment to assemble the queue. And our first question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan, please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike and Jason and thank you for all the comments. Mike, I just want to go back to your comments around simplifying the operating model on the medical supply side, and, where you talked about driving the mix of Cardinal branded products. One, can you remind us what percentage of sales say are Cardinal branded products. And then 2, can you talk about the margin differential on those products? And then my third and last question would just be that, now that you have the divestiture of Cordis behind you -- the sale of Cordis behind you, are there other assets within Medical that would make sense to divest? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Tough questions to answer, because these aren't things we have historically given. Obviously I can say this. We believe there is plenty of room to grow. Some of our accounts were significantly penetrated in and others obviously were less penetrated in. So we do have good target by account that we're going after. So we think there's plenty of opportunity in there. It's one of the key reasons we believe in our longer-term guidance for Medical is the fact that we can do that. As far as margin rates go, generally, they are much more higher as a percentage and dollars and national brand. There are times and certain preferred brand programs, which is why we have them that we do prefer national brand.  But in general, as a rule of thumb, our margin rates are much more significant on our Cardinal sourced or Cardinal manufactured products.  And then lastly around Cordis, we're always looking at our entire portfolio of businesses to make sure we have the right type of businesses where we are positioned to win. There's nothing that sticks out to me in terms of a certain product category or that, but we are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are exiting 36 countries. So not only do we look at products, we look at products by country and countries, and where we don't believe we have significant growth opportunity, whether it might be too much risk versus benefit, etc. We have made real conscious decisions to aggressively manage the number of countries and which is why we are exiting 36 countries to help simplify the model. Operator : All right. And up next, we will take a question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Mike and Jason, I want to just talk a little bit about the long-term growth targets a little bit here. I guess first is when we're starting the jump off point for these -- for the earnings and earnings growth, are you starting from fiscal '22. And is that a 5-year target that we should be thinking about or are we jumping off from fiscal '21 as the baseline year?  And then secondly, within that, can you just remind us again, what the -- obviously the earnings this year are back half-way -- just remind us what the tailwinds that we should be considering as we build our model for the remainder of this fiscal year. And then lastly, those higher freight and shipping costs, do you assume those go away after this year as we think about it in relation to the long-term targets? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Hi. Good morning, this is Jason, I'll try to capture all those points. Your question is certainly fair as it relates to trying to define the baseline for those longer-term targets. As we indicated in the remarks today, we do anticipate this additional $100 million to a $125 million related to the inflationary environment as temporary. It's difficult certainly to define exactly if that's short-term, medium-term, or longer-term. And at the current moment, we would expect those to revert back to some normalized level in a time frame that is relatively short to medium term. And so when we talk about these longer-term targets, we are not presuming that type of tailwind, right. So it isn't a more normalized state when we provide those targets. You referenced 5-year, so I'd say 3 to 5 years is a reasonable type of time frame for average types of performance levels, to get a broad perspective on the ins and the outs, but we would not expect big shocks associated with items like that, divestitures and acquisitions, things that nature would also be normalized out of that so that we're getting at that core type of performance. And then as it relates to more specifics around elevated supply chain cost, we highlighted within our remarks that its really just two key areas; the international freight and the commodities. In both cases, the reason we believe that they are temporary is that they are at multiple levels higher than what we've historically seen on international freight, which is essentially the cost of getting a shipping container shipped from overseas locations such as Asia to the U.S. We're seeing that cost up 8 to 10 times versus pre -COVID levels. Certainly we would expect that to be significantly lower at some point in the future. And on the commodities, we're talking about a lot of different types of polymers, such as polypropylene. Those levels are more like 2x what we've seen historically. So again, we would expect those to get back to a more normalized state at some point in the future. But again, those are not tailwinds to get us to these targets, those targets are more normalized.  In terms of the second half, a different cadence of our results for the various businesses, we did indicate that with Pharma, we would expect the second half to continue to improve steadily versus where we're at today. Just as it relates to getting back to more normalized stay for underlying generics volume. So that continues to be as expected and also as expected, our investments in our technology investments, we indicated would be front-end loaded, especially with the first three quarters, primarily as it relates to that fourth-quarter. We started to implement those cost increases in the final implementation last Q4. So we start to get the full-year effect of that as we exit the third quarter here. On the Medical side, we did indicate a sequential decline from Q1 to Q2, and that's just related to the timing of realizing that supply chain cost I was just walking through, and all of the mitigating actions that go along with that. And then, also recall that we cited the COVID favorability in Q2 of last year that is not expected to repeat, and in fact, we expect that to be a headwind to this Q2 primarily as a result of the PPE price and cost timing. So we have that Q1 to Q2 cadence. And then of course in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we'd expect a significant COVID tailwind associated with the comparison benefit from the PPE in the prior year. And then in all of our businesses, we expect ongoing stronger contributions from our growth businesses as we see the effects of various initiatives and investments that have been put in place over the course of last year.  Next question. Operator : And next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research, please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Appreciate the supply chain commentary. I'd like to get a little bit deeper here. We used to have guidance on commodity impact. So I think anything you can provide relative to $17 [billion] (ph) of revenue or the cost that you incur to give us some sense there. And then thinking about commodity and freight, what is clearly passed along versus what represents a decision that has to be made? And what I'm really looking for is $100 million to $125 million of increased expense. What does that represent relative to the total expense that you're seeing passed through? Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. Thanks for the question. So let me see if I could help. First of all, we as you know, called out in our fourth quarter of last year that we did expect elevated supply chain costs. So in our guidance for this year for the medical segment, we already assumed a certain amount of elevated supply chain costs, some of which we have plans already to offset through cost reductions, pricing actions, and those types of things, and that was originally built-in. What we saw during the quarter, particularly as the quarter went on, was a significant increase in those supply chain costs, most notably in international freight, high containers that we talked about, as well as commodities. And those we feel will create an incremental $100 to a $125 million of costs for us. Roughly, I would say that $100 to a $125 is split relatively evenly between the impact of commodities and the impact of freight costs. So they were both very, very significant and we saw other minor ones in other areas, but those were the really 2 big ones, both of which we believe are temporary because 1. as Jason said earlier, they are at all-time highs for the most part, significantly higher than where they were and we believe that over time, the market will adjust and those will be able to come back down. So what are we doing about that? That is a net number, the $100 to $125 obviously since we called that out as the adjustments of Medical guidance, is that we are getting after it through pricing actions, passing some of it through. It's hard to really talk about exactly which once you can pass through or not. The market is very complicated. There are contracts that we have to work through. We have to work with our partners, both the hospitals and the GPOs. We have to understand the supply and demand dynamics of each item in the environment. And so we are working through and understanding all of those factors but there is some additional pricing action built into that number. And then obviously since we maintain guidance for the entire Company, we are taking aggressive cost actions across the Company. We are leveraging our improved balance sheet. And we're also focusing on our growth businesses, and pushing our teams to do more faster there. So those are some -- I hope some helpful comments. Jason Hollar : And the only thing I'd add is that this increase is not -- it's related to 2 parts. It's a greater increase in both of these areas of international freight and commodities, but it's also longer expected duration. We had anticipated that they would come back to more normalized levels a bit earlier. So we saw a higher spike and a longer duration. And in terms of just how you model it through on revenue, I'd like to draw -- just draw a little bit of distinction. With PPE, we saw many, many times higher total impact on that product cost, and so we saw a much more significant number of dollars in both cost and revenue that came through. While this is still significant, it's much less meaningful from a revenue perspective, and is not moving that needle nearly as much. Next question. Operator : And next we'll hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my question. So if I'm doing the math right, it appears that the bad guy that is the incremental supply chain costs is larger than the good guy, the lower share count, and perhaps the lower tax rate. Am I doing -- am I thinking about that right. And the fact that you didn't change guidance, is that just you're still within the range but maybe it's the lower end of the range or you were just giving yourself a little room. How should we think about that? Jason Hollar : Yeah. I think your math is accurate for the items that we typically provide guidance. One area that's not explicitly called out but is implied is just the underlying other corporate expenses. And as we referenced a few times already in Mike's specific comments, there's broad-based cost reductions, the $750 million program which we increased by $250 million last quarter, is enterprise-wide and that includes the corporate function. So we have identified additional corporate cost reduction actions that are not included in either of the segments, but do fall through to the bottom line, the total segment profit as well as our earnings per share. Mike Kaufmann : Next question, please. Operator : And next we'll hear from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. I want to dive a little bit more into some of the long-term guidance and concurrent contrast that with the dynamics you're seeing right now in terms of supply chain. I know that a lot of these are already control and clearly, some companies in the space are seeing similar approaches. That being said, as you think about the ways you interact with your customers now, and interact with your partners and supplier partners, are there any ways that you can continue to evolve your business so that maybe we don't see ever spikes like this. But some of the fluctuations and volatility that you have seen at the supply chain in the past. And I'm thinking particularly on some of the raw material cost spikes that do come up from time-to-time. Are ways that can be mitigated in a more systematic fashion going forward so we don't have this level of volatility and [Indiscernible] surprise for stuff that, as I mentioned, a lot of it is -- tends to be out of your control. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. I really appreciate the question. It's a really good one. So let me step back and hit a couple of different pieces, and I'll finish with your question on medical, but I'll take a shot here to emphasize a few others. So there's really, I would say, 3 obviously components to our long-term target, which our long-term target we're talking about is having a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield on averages as Jason mentioned. In Pharma, the -- to your point, we don't really see those fluctuations in commodities and costs affecting their business generally, because if it does, it generally happens in the form of the drugs having increases, which in that model, are able to be passed on and work through the model. And so our goal of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in Pharma is really focused on strengthening that [Indiscernible] balance, getting that right mix of generics, making sure we're managing the balancing through of our margin initiatives and all that as well as then driving our growth businesses, specialty nuclear in out comes, and we gave some color on those. Hopefully, you found helpful and exciting for instance nuclear doubling in the next five-years especially, continuing and outcomes continuing with double-digit growth. We believe the combination of getting that PD business stabilize, which we're seeing and then seeing the growth there is really what's going to drive that. And then of course we mentioned in the use of capital being able to having our debt lower commitment to our dividend, and then the share repurchases. On medical as you mentioned, it's a couple of different things that simplify our operating model, focusing on driving mix and filling our growth businesses. I won't go into those details because we did in the comments. But to your question rollout kind of changes can we make that help. It's really one of the things we are working on with customers right now is how do we change our contracts with our customers to give us more flexibility when there is sudden significant changes in the supply chain, that there is some ability to raise price. Our discussions with our customer -- our customers are being very transparent. We want to be able to make sure that if we're able to do that, we're very willing to tie those things -- indexes and things so they understand that as they come back down. We're not -- we're going to pass lower-cost back on to them, because we don't want to look at this as a necessarily a chance to improve our margins. We'd like to do that through driving mix and launching more products, not on the backs of our customers during a supply chain. So we are working with them to create contracting methods that will allow us to be able to pass those on, as well as help them understand what are the metrics we will do to be able to know for them when they're changed the other direction too. Operator : And our next question will come from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. AdamHeussner: Hi. This is Adam on for Jailendra today. Thanks for taking the question. Going back to your long-term growth targets, just wondering if you take into account the capital allocated to the anticipate opioid segment payments or how we should be thinking about that potential impact as it relates to being able to invest across some of your growth and higher-margin businesses? Jason Hollar : Yes. Good morning, Adams, Jason. Yes. That would incorporate that as we think about the capital deployment side of that. We have for quite some time now included in an expectation of what those payments would be. That's all based upon our current set of assumptions, of course that I would change materially, and that would change your answer, but based upon what we know now, that would be the baseline, for example, the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that we have just completed is inclusive of that as well, as a part of the capital outlay that we would expect over that period of time, and this would be the available capital beyond that. Next question. Operator : And up next we'll take a question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the Medical segment. You mentioned that despite some impact from the Delta variant, that the total elective volumes exited the quarter near 95% of pre -COVID levels. I guess I'm curious if there's any updates on your assumptions for the pace of return to procedures for the remainder of fiscal '22. Is this also a positive factor that helps to offset some of the negatives that you discussed within the Medical segment. Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yeah. The -- there was a little bit of a reduction in that base -- in that level of elective procedures in the first quarter. We started the quarter at close to pre -COVID levels. And as we indicated, we exited in the back at about 95%. And we think that's primarily attributed to the Delta variant. So we see that trending in the right direction. And with the pace of the virus since then, we feel that will continue to improve. And importantly, what we saw in the quarter is we saw an improvement in our Lab business that effectively offset that modest deterioration in the amount of elective procedures. So what we're seeing right now is that those two items tend to generally offset both good and bad depending upon the pace of the virus. So it's nothing significant that we saw in the quarter and as a result, we don't anticipate there being wild fluctuations going forward. Next question. Operator : And next we'll take a question from Stuart Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Stuart Hill : Good morning, guys and this is the second time this earnings season has been [Indiscernible] Jason and Mike, just a quick question on the long-term guide, which is, over the long term, how do you think about the underlying operating earnings growth contribution versus the capital deployment or inorganic growth contribution? Mike Kaufmann : I think if you -- as you break down the long-term targets, when we were really talking about Pharma being low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth, we're really talking about the operating earnings of that segment being in the low-single to mid-single Medical being in mid-single to high single digit. And then the rest of it would come from our dividend yield, as well as capital deployment around REPO to get to the double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. So the guidance on medical and foremost really about operating earnings and I would also say that M&A is not a top priority and that that may occur, and we may have some of that here and there. That is one option with capital deployment. But this is really more focused on what we talked about, operating earnings growth as well as dividend yield and opportunistic repo. Next question. Operator : All right. And our last question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Good morning, so on the long-term double-digit growth, I know you talked about the growth rate being sort of on a normalized basis. So should we take that long term double digit growth back out from 2020 to guidance sort of the abnormal costs that you are seeing, normalized for them and then apply that growth rate to get to 2023. That's the first part of the question and then secondly, as we think about these transitory costs in nature. You talked about a $100 to a$ 125 million costs related to the supply chain. What's the contribution of labor cost to that headwind? Because when we think about labor costs, we think about it as potentially more structural because once you raise someone salaries, it's difficult to bring it back down. So how should we think about that component within the additional cost? Jason Hollar : Sure. Good morning, Ricky. This is Jason. I'll start. As we talked about our long-term target, it's not expected or intended to be each and every year. There's a reason that we do a highlight that is an average over that period of time. So we're not providing fiscal '23 guidance with the statement. With that said, we think that there are over these longer periods of time that these would be the primary drivers and expectations we would have for our businesses. And how you described at about the normalized level as an example that 100 to 125 five were -- we indicated that we anticipate these costs remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22, we're not taking a position at this point as to how much, if any, carries over into fiscal '23, that is a terrific example of an important element of fiscal '23 guidance that we will provide in the future that is not at this point something that we feel comfortable being able to identify. And then your question about labor is a great one. We did not call it out because it is very consistent with what we had last quarter. So while labor, inflation, and those pressures are very real for us, like the whole industry, we are not seeing anything new and unique this quarter versus last quarter, and so we're not adding in any additional costs for that. But I would also highlight that even what was included in the original guidance was not nearly as substantial as the cost that we're referencing for and what was included before for commodities and international freight. Those are clearly the most significant items that drive that fluctuation, and items like labor as well as more domestic related costs such as domestic transportation and other fuel are all relatively low compared to those other 2 primary items, the international freight and commodities. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back over to CEO, Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I'd like to conclude with just a few thoughts. I know the elevated product costs within the Medical Segment carried a lot of attention here today. But I want to just reiterate that, 1. We do believe the majority of these costs are temporary. 2. That we're taking aggressive enterprise-wide actions to help mitigate. And 3. We did reaffirm our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, in Pharma, we are encouraged by the profit growth we saw in the quarter, and the ongoing resiliency in this business. With an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization and our commitment to our dividend, we are positioned to return capital to shareholders while prioritizing investment in our growth businesses, simplifying our operating model, and strengthening our core businesses. And together this gives us confidence in achieving the new long-term growth targets that we provided. With that, thank you again. We hope you all have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 results along with an update to our FY\u201922 Outlook. You can find today\u2019s press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, Jason\u2019s and my comments will be consistent with the update we provided a few weeks ago. Let me start with the few high level thoughts. At an enterprise level, we continue to focus our efforts on three strategic priorities : optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation and deploying capital efficiently. We continue to believe the long-term targets we announced in November are appropriate and we remain on-track to meet our $750 million enterprise cost savings target by FY\u201923. Our Pharma business is performing as planned. We\u2019ve seen volumes continue to improve sequentially and we\u2019re encouraged by the growth we saw again in Q2. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pharma to realize mid-single-digit growth in FY\u201922. In our Medical segment, we continue to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in our core U.S. medical and products distribution business. These impacts, combined with lower than expected offsets from pricing actions, will significantly impact medical segment profit consistent with our update a few weeks ago. While we believe these impacts are temporary, the timing of when they will be, remains difficult to predict. Consequently, we\u2019re urgently working to mitigate the effect of these external macroeconomic challenges on our business. We\u2019re seeing progress in other areas of the Medical segment, including our Lab business in growth areas and we recently extended several key acute care distribution customers. Looking ahead, I\u2019ll elaborate on the actions we\u2019re taking to drive performance, particularly for Medical, after Jason reviews our Q2 results and updated outlook. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter revenue increased 9% to $45 billion, driven by sales growth from existing pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9%, primarily due to the Cordis divestiture and elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Consolidated SG&A was flat to the prior year at $1.2 billion, as the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives offset IT investments and higher operations expenses. Second quarter operating earnings were $467 million. Outside of the incremental inflationary impacts of Medical, these results were generally in line with our expectations. Moving below line, interest and other decreased by 30% to $24 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The second quarter effective tax rate finished at 19.4%, 6 percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items, which primarily benefited the prior year period. Additionally, our second quarter rate this year included some timing favorability. Average diluted shares outstanding were $281 million, 5% lower than the prior year due to share repurchases. Of note, we initiated a $300 million share repurchase program in the quarter, which was recently completed and brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $800 million. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.27. Second quarter operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 billion, and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. In the quarter, we also recorded a $1.3 billion non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge primarily resulted from additional inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints, I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Now turning to segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 11% to $41 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 3% to $426 million, driven by generics program performance. This was partially offset by our previously discussed investments and technology enhancements and higher operations expenses, including cost supporting sales growth such as transportation and labor. During the quarter, we were encouraged to see continued broad-based improvements in pharmaceutical demand consistent with our expectations, including a return of generic volumes to approximately pre-pandemic levels. Our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics, including continued strong performance from Red Oak. Outside of generics, we\u2019ve seen brand inflation trending in line with our expectations. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 5% to $4.1 billion, primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. Segment profit decreased 79% to $50 million, primarily due to inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. This also reflects the timing of selling higher cost PPE, including the net positive impact from this dynamic in the prior year and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of the Cordis business. During the quarter, our products and distribution business continued to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures in the global supply chain primarily in the areas of polypropylene and international freight. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw broader inflationary impacts across the business such as domestic freight and other commodities as well as global supply chain constraints affecting the volume of some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products. I\u2019ll discuss these impacts with respect to our full year Medical outlook momentarily and Mike will elaborate on the actions we\u2019re taking to address these macro challenges and drive performance in our core Medical business. With respect to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, we continue to see strong performance from our Lab business, including significant testing demand generally consistent with levels seen a year ago. And despite some impacts from Omicron and various geographies, demand for surgical products related to elective procedures was comparable to both the first quarter and prior year. Now transitioning to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slide 8. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, primarily reflecting our updated expectations for Medical. We also now expect an annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24.5% and interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million, with the improvement in I&O, including deferred compensation favorability which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate SG&A. As for the segments on Slide 9. For Pharma, no changes to our outlook, we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. For Medical, we now expect revenue to be down low single to mid-single digit and segment profit to be down 30% to 45%. Consistent with the financial update provided a few weeks ago, we expect increased inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints as well as lower than expected pricing offsets to result in an estimated incremental $150 million to $175 million headwind to Medical segment profits for the full year. This, in addition to our November 9 update regarding the pressures and international freight and polypropylene, now reflects a total net incremental headwind of approximately $250 million to $300 million to Medical in fiscal 2022. While these impacts are persisted for longer than previously anticipated, we continue to believe the majority will be temporary as global supply chain pressures eventually abate. While it will take time, we\u2019re committed to mitigating the impacts of inflationary pressures and will continue to work through these dynamics with our customers. Now a few other things to keep in mind in terms of the fiscal 2022 cadence. For Pharma, we expect the year-over-year growth in the back half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due to the lapping of some prior year items including higher costs for the deployment of IT investments and the general sequencing of our growth initiatives. In Medical, we continue to expect an unfavorable year-over-year impacts due to timing of selling higher cost PPE in the second half of fiscal 2022, though not to the same magnitude as in the second quarter. We also will be lapping the large prior year PPE inventory reserve in the fourth quarter. Finally to close, a few reminders on the capital deployment. We continue to expect the pay down to approximate $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity and continue to expect approximately $1 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2022. As we said, we see our increasing balance sheet flexibility supporting more opportunistic return-of-capital to shareholders as our debt pay down begins to moderate enabled by our recent $3 billion share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that capital deployment along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments will drive the long term double digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we\u2019re targeting. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Jason. In Medical, we\u2019re continuing to take action to drive performance and maximize the differentiated strengths we\u2019ve in this business. We\u2019re vertically integrated with distribution through our comprehensive Medical products portfolio, which is generally oriented around the operating room and the intensive care unit. We also have an advantage of products portfolio in higher margin growth businesses. With our diverse customer base, we cross sell products and services spanning our portfolio. To address the challenges in our Medical business, we\u2019re focused on three things. First, evolving our commercial contracting strategy and driving mix. Historically, costs have been relatively stable and industry participants have committed to longer term multiyear contracts. However, the rapid escalation of today\u2019s inflationary pressures demonstrate that our contracting strategy needs to change. We\u2019re in the process of working with our customers to adjust certain contracts to ensure we\u2019ve more pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. With regards to mix, as I noted in the prior quarter, we\u2019ve made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives. We\u2019re underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential which remains a significant mid to long term profit opportunity as we move past the pandemic and associated supply chain challenges. Within our Medical products portfolio, we\u2019re actively improving our key category product offerings. For example, in our confidence product line, we\u2019ve launched a new Cardinal Health brand stretch free and a comprehensive breathable platform. These enhancements directly support and meet our customers\u2019 needs. Second, we\u2019re simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. We remain on track regarding the timing of the previously announced exits in certain commercial markets with 35 of the 36 completed to-date. We\u2019re focused on the modernization of our distribution facilities including breaking ground on a new distribution center in the Midwest with nearly triple the space of the existing facility enabling future growth. We believe that a diverse global sourcing network is important to remain competitive on cost and are investing in additional self manufacturing capabilities including increases in annual production of safety needles and syringes, isolation gowns and surgical and procedural masks in our own North American facility. Specifically for surgical gowns, we\u2019ve efforts underway that would double our North American finished goods production and enhance our supply chain resiliency. Third, we continue to invest across the Medical segment including in our growth businesses, At-Home Solutions and medical services, which are aligned with industry trends and position to grow double digits in FY\u201922 and beyond. In At-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continues to shift into the home. We recently announced an additional strategic investment in Medically Home, a technology company that enables health systems with other partners like Cardinal Health to safely bring the hospital at home for patients increasingly preferred to receive their care. Not only does this hospital at home model benefit patients, it also provides needed capacity for hospitals and delivers care in a lower cost setting. And in our higher margin medical services businesses OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chain and are seeing growth driven by an expanded customer base and diversified solution. We\u2019ve invested in additional technology capabilities to increase our offerings in both businesses. In OptiFreight, we\u2019ve invested in additional technology capabilities focused on building automated technology driven solutions that innovate the way healthcare supply chain leaders manage shipping spend and take control over their transportation logistics. These efforts are connecting suppliers and customers at over 22,000 shipping locations. In WaveMark, we\u2019ve launched a cutting edge supply automation solution for clinical labs, which automates previously manual inventory management task. This enables clinical lab staff to focus on patient care and better managed increased testing demand due to COVID-19. Our Pharma business remains on track to deliver mid-single digit growth in FY\u201922. We continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core Pharma distribution or PD business. This quarter segment profit was driven by the performance in our generics program. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak sourcing, a partnership we also recently extended through FY\u201929 and which positions us well to meet customers\u2019 needs. In addition, our multiyear technology investment to modernize our systems is on track. We plan to complete the rollout by the beginning of our Q4 and look to benefit from the conversion in FY\u201923 and beyond. Second, we\u2019re fueling our growth businesses, Specialty, Nuclear and Outcomes. In Specialty, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business driven in part by Navista TS, our technology platform for value based care. Just this week, we announced a partnership with Ember Technologies to offer the world\u2019s first self-refrigerated cloud based shipping box for temperature-sensitive medicines. As biopharma continues bringing cold chain biologic products to market including cell and gene therapies, this partnership will help ensure product integrity throughout the supply chain. This is a differentiated offering and one that will reduce landfill rates by millions of pounds annually and with biosimilars, we\u2019re well positioned to support the next phase of growth as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas and slides of care. In Nuclear, we expect continued double digit profit growth which will result in a doubling of our profit in this business by FY\u201926. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis where we partner with several pharma companies to develop and commercialize novel Theranostics and we\u2019re investing in our PET capabilities to support robust PET diagnostics. For example, with the FDA approval of Telix\u2019s radiopharmaceutical in Q2, we\u2019re positioned to drive nationwide accessibility and broad adoption of prostate specific PET imaging for physicians and eligible patients across the United States. And in Outcomes, we\u2019re adding new payers and PBMs and expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. Outcomes recently activated it\u2019s 20 million user on its digital patient engagement platform, which enables two-way communication between pharmacies and patients to increase medication adherence. With respect to the Enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We\u2019re pairing cost reduction efforts with balance, discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation with the focus on investing in the business, maintain a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. Long term, we\u2019re targeting a double digit combined EPS growth and dividends yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segment, our commitment to our dividend and our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Now let me provide an update on the proposed opioid settlement agreement and settlement process. As of today, 46 out of 49 states have indicated their intent to join the global settlement. The sign on period for political subdivisions within participating states concluded on January 26. Now each of the participating states are in the process of determining whether there is sufficient subdivision participation to proceed. After we receive notice from the states regarding their decision, each of the distributors will make final determinations by February 25. If all conditions are satisfied this agreement would resolve in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid losses followed by the state and local governmental entities. This is an important step forward for our company as we\u2019ve consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution to the US opioid epidemic and believe that settlement would provide relief for our communities and increase certainty for our shareholders. In closing, our aspiration has been and continues to be that we\u2019re healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner. We will do this by focusing on our customers\u2019 need and delivering the products and solutions that advance healthcare and improve the lives of people every day. We bring life changing healthcare innovation to market harnessing the power of technology, data and insights to optimize care delivery for investing in technology and analytics to drive future growth in evolving areas of healthcare and address healthcare\u2019s most complicated challenges. What we do matters and we\u2019re focusing our resources on building solutions to meet the needs of our customers and their patients now and in the future. And now, Jason and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks, guys. Mike and Jason, I want to talk about the issues with supply costs here, and we\u2019re obviously challenged at the moment. But can you talk a little bit more about As, let's say, these pressures ease, let's say, hopefully, later this year or whenever? Can you talk about how those expenses that you are incurring today roll off? Do they kind of roll off fairly quickly, or is it that these kind of knock-on effects of delays and everything for all your supplies and equipment just kind of just drag even further beyond if we were to see reports that the ports are working as normal? How long is that kind of follow-on effects before everything really would return to normal? And from a P&L perspective, are these kind of expenses kind of overshadowing, let's say, sort of the underlying performance of the division or a little more color on that would be helpful? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Sure. I'll definitely start here, it\u2019s Jason, and then I'm sure Michael has some thoughts as well. But generally speaking, the vast majority of these costs that we've outlined are product-related cost or cost to get the products shipped to United States where our customers typically are. And as such, most of those costs are included in inventory and then expensed as they're sold. So that means that there would be a one to two-quarter delay in terms of when those costs begin to come down and when you would start to see that offset then in the P&L. And that's I think fairly typical for the - what we saw with PPE as well last year in terms of that type of cadence. Now there is some of this, a smaller portion is related to the volume impact of the supply chain constraints, so that's obviously going to be at the time that volume freeze up. There's a small part that the period cost, but it's much less significant. Again, the biggest buckets when you step back and think about the $250 million to $300 million, that's an aggregate that we're talking about, is that international freight is the biggest piece and it's very much inventoried as I just described. And then the second largest would be the general commodities we talked about, commodities like oil-based commodities like polypropylene, that is the big driver that again those would all be inventoried cost and then flowing through. As it relates to the overall impacts to the business, just using Q2 as the example from a year-over-year perspective, this overall aggregate impact of the inflation and net of pricing is the greatest driver of the year-over-year reduction. We did as a reminder have favorability last Q2 as it relates to the timing of PPE pricing cost. So it's a little bit of a headwind than on an absolute basis this quarter, but it's more significant, the comparison to the favorability of last year. And that's about $60 million in this quarter. So that's a relevant piece to the year-over-year impact. And then the final piece as you know, Cordis is running at roughly - last year was roughly $20 million a quarter. So the absence of that business as was divested is that last piece. So I think that gives you most of the key pieces. Mike Kaufmann : Yes, the only thing I would add Charles is that wow everything Jason said is true, the one to two quarters and all that. One thing I want to make sure people understand is we're actively getting after this now. So we're not going to have a strategy of just waiting for these to come down. So we are evolving our commercial and contracting strategies, that is something we're actively doing, working with customers to be able to either pass on some of these prices change or contracting driving our mix as we talked about and continuing to aggressively get after our cost and invest in our growth businesses. So while we will hopefully see these come down because we do believe these are temporary, we're also at the same time getting after things that we need to do manage and operate the business aggressively. Next question? Operator : We will go ahead and move on to our next question now from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Hi, thanks very much. Mike, can I just first start with a follow-up to what you just talked about. When we think about your medical business longer-term, I know you previously had a goal of north of 5% operating margin improvement surge. I know they part of that was the higher margin of Cordis. But when we get back to a more normalized basis, how do we think about what the margin should look like in that business? Mike Kaufmann : Yes, that's a great question. We've now put that out there. I will give you a couple of things. Obviously at the inflation goes away and as we said, we believe this 250, the 300 that the vast majority of that is temporary. So you can add that back to our margin rates as the biggest driver. Second of all, the second thing I would add is we said we want to drive mix. And what we mean by that is selling more of Cardinal Health branded products versus National brand. That's going to also drive our mix in a positive way. We're getting after expenses, that's going to drive our margins to for the segment. And we're growing our growth business, which do have higher margin. So all of our key initiatives not only will drive bottom line, but they all should drive margin rates up significantly. But at this point in time, we're not putting target margin rate out there that we're going after. Operator : And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I want to stay on this topic, and my question is can we talk a little bit about your expectations for some of these specific items may be built into the year or your view on duration? And I separate kind of freight commodity and then the sales volume and duration on how long you pass this on given the new contracting methodology. Can you just give us your take on either expectations today or based on prior experience and what you know today the duration of those trend pressures? Jason Hollar : Yes, again, this is Jason, I'll start. So to your point, it will potentially differ not only by type of cost, but also the magnitude of what we're talking about. So as it relates to first of all, just to the international freight, one thing to highlight is that that particular area of cost has remained at very elevated levels. So at this point, we're not seeing much of a change from where we have been. And so that's something that is a clear part of our pricing focus is to make sure we can get at least a good portion of that recovered. As it relates to some of the other commodities, they've been more volatile. We have seen some that have started to appear to come down that cost sort of looks like they may have plateaued and started to reduce others that have been choppier. And so that environment where the costs are moving around a lot, it is -- provides more challenges as it relates to getting that pricing more established. I think the key is, as you think about the cadence of what this impact is on a net basis, that $250 million to $300 million, we have already incurred about a $100 million of that year-to-date. That $150 million to $200 million that's remaining within our guidance, we see that peaking in the third quarter and that's a combination of not only the cost we expect to be at its highest and then as they start to come down and that takes that delay to get it actually flowing through our inventory to our P&L. That then will start to benefit us later in the year. But also that also the timing of when we would start to see from the pricing actions that we have already begun to start to come through. It is just the beginning, it's not offsetting enough of that. There's more activity that will need to still occur. But it all depends on exactly what that cadence is of cost and the key is that we remain very close to both the GPOs as well as our customers to manage through that on an item-by-item customer/customer basis to get to an answer then that will give us the right cadence exiting the year. With all that said I\u2019ve given the one to two quarter lag even of if costs do come down and even if we have more success with the pricing we would expect there to be a carry over into fiscal \u201923 there will be some impact [on result] of the year but we need to see the cadence of both the cost and the pricing before we can establish that more clearly. Operator : We will go ahead and move on to our next question Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is [Dan] for Ricky. Two questions from us, one as we think about you are moved to little bit more finished goods production back in North America. How should we think about that in terms margin sort of an pre-COVID environment and the impact of margin as we think about your margins in the recent quarts and as a follow up just wanted to confirm updated tax rate interest expense guidance back in today, but that enquired early January updater, is that incremental. Thank you. Mike Kaufmann : Jason will talk about the tax rate then I can talk about the margin. Jason Hollar : There was some small differences in this latest update the tax rate was just bringing down the top end a little bit low and was not much with difference there. The interesting another change I highlighted was in part related to deferred comp and as reminder that just geography between interest and other as well corporate SG&A so, yes there was largely considered in our prior assumptions but as a lot of it is just geography anyway. So there's no material difference in those other updates. Mike Kaufmann : And as far as moving capacity to our North American operations, I would say a couple of things. Generally I wouldn\u2019t say that we would expect much of a margin difference, if it was manufactured outside of North America versus manufactured here. That is not something I would say would be a margin driver, it's more about supply chain integrity, which is why we moved in there. So if there are disruptions in the future, we obviously then have certain key items closer here. So we've chosen as items that can be highly automated, make a lot of sense and freight is a big piece of it. So that we can still stay cost competitive. So again I want to say it's margined generating in and of itself. However by increasing the capacity on some of these items like we mentioned doubling our ability to manufacture our own gown, that does give us more ability to sell our own product which is we drive mix that would increase our overall margin rate. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Jailendra Singh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jailendra Singh : Thank you, and good morning. A run up. With respect to the third, 250 million to the 300 million impact in medical segment, can you be a little bit more specific on how much impact did you see in fiscal first half and how much is expected in second half. And a follow-up to an earlier question, how should be modeled the split between 3Q and 4Q on the remaining impact. I'm trying to better understand if all these initiatives you're putting in place are more focused on positioning the company in better next time you see these kind of pressure or do you think there's a possibility these initiatives result in some near term offsets and are you capturing those in your outlook? Jason Hollar : Yes, I -- if I understood the question right, Jailendra, the I think I'd answer before I'll go and repeat that. So the 250 million to 300 million, 100 million was has already been incurred in the first half. I think about it as kind of a sequential step up, so Q2 was higher than Q1 and Q3 is expected to be higher than Q2. And then that's the period that peaks before it starts to come back down. So there is, it depends on that if we're talking sequential or year-over-year from a sequential perspective from Q2 to Q3 within the medical business. That is just the ongoing cost reductions that we would expect to be always in place that continue those initiatives we talked fairly consistently about are there. Within the other type of PPE impacts, like I said from a year-over-year perspective in the second quarter, it was $60 million headwind. There was a small headwind in an absolute basis in the second quarter that we think will be less in the third quarter. So it's a bit of an offset and not significant but generally speaking it's the inflationary impacts. So the most pronounced from a year-over-year as well as expected to be a little bit greater than in the third quarter. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Things I would add be helpful here is Jason mentioned as we expect some of the inflation impacts to start to hopefully come down some and that will give us a little bit of benefit in Q4. We also see our pricing actions ramping up some in Q4 too because we are continuing to implement additional pricing actions. We have some going into effect here very soon that have been agreed to. So we're working through those. So I would say that that would be a positive item going forward for us. Also as we mention, we are working on our commercial contracting strategies. And so, as we work through those contracts, our goal is to give us more flexibility. So that in the future if there is another instance like this, we are able to react a quicker and address our pricing and work with our partners in a very transparent and productive way because our customers are obviously some of the thing that we have to always have in the front of our mind but we do need some more flexibility in the business and we are working aggressively to work with the GPOs and our customers do that. Jason Hollar : And Jailendra, as you do your modeling for the balance of the year, just remember in the prior year we had the significant inventory charge in Q4 that would of course not be expected to replicate here this year. Operator : We will then and move on to your next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for the details. Mike, you mentioned in your remarks how you had a few customer extensions to some of your key customers on the medical side. Especially against this backdrop of your focus on re-contracting, would love to know a little more detail about how qualitatively those discussions went and in terms of your thought process where we're re-contracting, we're able to test out where you were able to get through and not get through and what customers are willing to accept relative to that change contracting dynamics especially given the obviously extensions on customers that have worked with you, I assume for at least a long time. Mike Kaufmann : That's a great question. Yes, we're -- we are working aggressively on that. It's not just the individual customers, in fact it's just as important to be able to work with our GPO partners to allow us because you really have to coordinate between all three of them. So there's still absolutely work to do but we're seeing some positive signs from both the GPOs and the customers that understand the importance of having a strong supply chain and strong supply chain partners in medical distribution. That these are things that we're going to have to work together. Key things that we've learned to those discussions that we'll be helpful as one, our willingness to be transparent with them so that we understand as costs come up why are they going up and also when costs come down so that they know that you're not continuing to charge a high price when things have got better and we're very willing to work with them on this transparency piece which I think will help both parties understand the importance of what we need to do here from a pricing standpoint. So I would say early indications have been positive but still a lot of work to do as we work on changing our commercial strategies. Operator : And our last question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on as we sort of have gone through a month in the new quarter. Just now you're seeing sort of volumes come back particularly on the surgical side and also on to the home care just so sort of we think about the cadence for that going through the back half of the year? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. And maybe I'll just take the opportunity to just talk about volumes in general because I think whether it\u2019s pharma or medical, the general response is about the same. Within medical, while there has been certain level of choppiness over the last three to six months, largely it's been very consistent with our expectations. We indicated before we are back to near pre-COVID levels and this quarter was pretty consistent with our expectations. And sequentially, from the first quarter as well as the year-over-year, there were not many differences. And so, there's noise but the key is that state-by-state, geography-by-geography, different regions are impacted at different times to different extents but we're just not seeing big impact. That\u2019s because our customers continue to do a wonderful job of providing great service to their patients and that's providing a better balance underneath the volume than what we saw earlier on in the pandemic. On the pharma side, we continued to talk in today's prepared remarks as well as a couple of weeks ago and just that we continue to see that widespread improvement back to pre-COVID levels and we have largely gone back to that point at the end of the second quarter and so we're just not seeing a lot of variability there as well. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Kaufmann for closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Ali. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all of your questions. I like to conclude by reiterating that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts in supply chain constraints. And we're laser focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. So please stay safe and we'll speak with you again soon. Take care, everybody. Operator : And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on both near-term priority and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. At an enterprise level, we're maintaining our focus on our three strategic priorities, optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation, and deploying capital efficiently. In pharma, despite the quarter being a little lower, due to higher operations costs, we remain encouraged by the trajectory of the business. We saw resiliency and overall pharmaceutical demand, strong performance in our generics program and continue to expect pharma to realize mid-single digit profit growth in FY '22. In medical, our core U.S. medical products and distribution business continues to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. We continue to take action to mitigate the effects of these global challenges on our business, including taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and investing in additional supply chain capacity. While we remain confident these actions will deliver value and are encouraged by the other areas of our medical business and our opportunities for long-term growth, the current environment remains highly dynamic. Our updated outlook for FY '22 reflects our most current expectation. I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to drive performance, particularly in medical after Jason reviews our third quarter results and updated outlook. Before turning the discussion over to Jason, it's important to note that the opioid settlement agreement was finalized during the quarter and became effective on April 2. This is an important and significant step forward for our company. We build a settlement is the best way to deliver relief to communities across the United States and allow our company to move forward by putting 1000s of lawsuits behind us. 46 of 49 eligible states, all six eligible territories and over 98% of litigating political subdivisions are part of the national agreement. This comprehensive agreement will settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement with the State of Washington and its participating subdivisions to resolve opioid-related claims on similar terms to the broader settlement, bringing the total number of states with which we have settled the 47 out of 49. While the settlements do not cover all opioid related claims, these comprehensive agreements are a significant milestone toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims, and include injunctive relief terms designed, in part to increase transparency for the supply chain to these products and demonstrate our commitment to the safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, third quarter revenue increased 14% to $45 billion driven by sales growth from existing and net new pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.7 billion a decrease of 7% due to the elevated supply chain costs in medical and the Cordis divestiture partially offset by generic program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting higher operations expenses and previously anticipated IT investments, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture in cost savings initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings decreased 21% to $545 million, primarily reflecting the elevated supply chain costs in medical. Moving below the line, interest and other increased by $8 million, which reflects one-time gains and other income in the prior year, partially offset by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. The third quarter effective tax rate finished at 20.1%, 11 percentage points lower than the prior year due to certain discrete items affecting both periods. Average diluted shares outstanding were 277 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we initiated a $200 million share repurchase program which was completed in April and brings our year-to-date repurchases to $1 billion. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.45, a decline of 5%. In the quarter, we also recorded a $474 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge related to the medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge reflects an increase in the discount rate used in our goodwill impairment analysis. Third quarter operating cash flow was a use of $490 million and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in addition to expecting strong operating cash flow generation, we received the previously defined tax receivable of approximately $1 billion in April. Timing, including the day of the week in which any period ends, affects point in time cash flows and fiscal '22 is unfavorably affected by this dynamic. Additionally, we expect approximately $550 million in total litigation payments this year, primarily related to opioid settlements, which includes the initial payments for the national settlement already made. Now turning into segments beginning with pharma on Slide five. Revenue increased 17% to $41 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit decreased 5% to $487 million driven by higher operations expenses and previously anticipated investments in technology enhancements, partially offset by generics program performance. During the quarter, we incurred higher costs supporting sales growth, including some initial customer onboarding costs and inflationary impacts in areas like transportation and labor. Importantly, we also completed the launch for our planned technology enhancements. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see resiliency in pharmaceutical demand and our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics including strong performance from Red Oak. Turning to medical on Slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.9 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes, which includes the impact of global supply chain constraints. Segment profit decreased 66% to $59 million, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. During the quarter, our U.S. medical products and distribution business continued to experience significant inflationary impacts across the global supply chain, particularly in the areas of international and domestic transportation and commodities. Additionally, increased pressures from global supply chain constraints affected the volume of some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products. To a lesser extent, the third quarter decline in segment profit also reflected a lower contribution from PPE as well as the Cordis divestiture. On PPE, we saw unfavorable price cost timing in the quarter as well as lower volumes as we exited the quarter. We were encouraged, however, by the resiliency in surgical product demand related to elective procedures, which was generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from a year ago. And we continue to see strong performance from our lab business. We continue to take actions to address the inflationary cost challenges and manage through the temporary supply disruptions including pricing adjustments, cutting costs throughout the organization, and investing in our supply chain network which Mike will elaborate on momentarily. Now, transitioning to our updated fiscal '22 outlook on Slide eight. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share, reflecting updated expectations for medical and a few of our corporate assumptions. With the favorability seem to-date from discrete items, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 281 million which reflects the $1 billion in share repurchases completed to-date. And with one quarter to go, we expect CapEx of approximately $400 million. We continue to expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million. As for the segments on Slide nine. For pharma, no changes to our outlook. We continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth, mid-single digit segment profit growth, and as previously indicated a strong fourth quarter segment profit growth. With the combination of our planned technology enhancements, we will now be lapping elevated expense levels from the initial deployment a year ago, which has been a year-over-year headwind last several quarters. We are also lapping a few one-time items that we called out last year, which will create a favorable fourth quarter comparison and we expect strong underlying performance in the quarter. For medical, we now expect revenue at the low end of our previous range down mid-single digits and segment profit to be down 45% to 55% in fiscal '22, which includes a net incremental headwind of nearly $300 million due to inflationary and global supply chain constraints. Additionally, based on volume trends, the update from our previous medical outlook primarily reflects a lower contribution from PPE. Now, let me spend some time sharing a few high-level thoughts on fiscal '23 from our vantage point today, ahead of providing our usual guidance in early August. In pharma, the business is tracking consistent with our long-term targets of low to mid-single digits segment profit growth. With respect to a couple of other notable pharma puts and takes for next year, we do anticipate higher operations expenses based on recent inflationary trends, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. Additionally, with the finalization of the global opioid settlement, we anticipate lower opioid related legal costs partially offset by higher costs for implementation of the settlement\u2019s injunctive relief terms. Together, we expect these litigation items to be a modest net tailwind in fiscal '23. For reference, we are currently estimating opioid related legal costs of approximately $115 million in fiscal '22. We expect a further reduction in opioid related legal costs in subsequent years. In medical, we are highly focused on the inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints affecting our U.S. medical products and distribution business. At this time, we expect a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 as in fiscal '22. Embedded in these are two key assumptions. First, with visibility generally limited to the first half of the year, we are assuming key cost drivers such as international freight and commodities have flattened and will begin to decrease slowly over the course of the next fiscal year, affecting our results in a one to two quarter delay. This would result in a greater absolute impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 due to the amortization of higher costs in the second half of fiscal '22. Second, we also expect a greater impact for mitigation initiatives with various waves of price increases going into effect throughout the year. In total, these two assumptions result in a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints as in the current year. As we exit fiscal '23, we anticipate a run rate where our pricing actions will offset approximately half of the gross impact. Though these inflationary impacts are persisting for much longer than originally anticipated, we remain committed to mitigating the effects on our medical business over time. We continue to believe the majority of these impacts will prove temporary once global supply chain pressures eventually abate or pricing will adjust accordingly. Below the line, we anticipate a year-over-year headwind in our fiscal '23 effective tax rate with the discrete favorability seen in fiscal '22 not expected to repeat. And with our strong balance sheet, we see the potential for accretive capital deployment through a similar level of share repurchases over the course of the year, supported by the $2.7 billion of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program expiring at the end of 2024. In summary, while there's obviously moving parts for fiscal '23, or any particular year, we continue to believe our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield are achievable over normalized longer periods. With that I'll turn it back over to Mike. Mike Kaufmann : Thanks Jason. Let me elaborate on the actions we are taking to drive medical performance and maximize our differentiated strength. First, we're taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies, and focusing on driving mix across our global business. We have implemented a series of initial customer price increases on nine Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also implemented fee increases for certain medical national brands suppliers, offset some of the elevated supply chain costs. We provide the most efficient and effective way for manufacturers to reach our customers and believe these increases help compensate us for the increased cost of providing this value. We have and will continue to be transparent and fair with customers and suppliers and focused on delivering on our service. As it relates to our products and distribution contracts, we are focusing on future pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control. To drive changes in mix, we're investing in new and innovative products to increase the breadth of our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio. One example of increased breadth is our recent launch of the first surgical incise drape using Avery Dennison\u2019s patented BeneHold CHG adhesive, which reduces risk of surgical site contamination, yet still removes easily after surgery without harming a patient's skin. Another example is our recently announced collaboration with the Innara Health, the industry leader in feeding development for newborns and premature infants to design our next generation NTrainer System, making it smaller, more intuitive, and easier to integrate into NICU feeding protocols. We are also investing to increase supply capacity, particularly within our protective surgical glove line, where we have increased our existing capacity by over 30% with a focus on long-term growth. We expect to invest over $125 million to expand our manufacturing footprint with the construction of a new facility dedicated to increase supply of our Protexis brand gloves and drive innovation in this important product portfolio. Second, we are simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. A year ago, we announced our intention to exit 36 market and those exits are now complete. We have also decided to exit another 10 markets where we see limited opportunity for long-term growth. Once complete, these actions will reduce our international commercial footprint by 50%, allowing us to focus on approximately 45 remaining markets where we are best positioned to serve. We are also optimizing our distribution network by consolidating less efficient facilities into larger modern, more efficient distribution centers to deliver improved service to our customers. For example, we recently announced plans to build a new approximately 600,000 square foot medical distribution center in Central Ohio, replacing a smaller facility nearby. This new facility along with others we have planning will improve service and quality, deliver operational efficiency and better support fluctuation in volume and labor. Additionally, our lab business is consolidating manufacturing and warehouse space into a new, larger 100,000 square foot facility. This move centralizes our high growth lab kitting services and supports significant expansion of our direct-to-consumer kitting capabilities. Third, in addition to investing in our core medical business, we continue to invest in our growth businesses at-Home Solution and Medical Services, which are aligned with industry trends. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continue to shift into the home. We recently partnered with Kinaxis to optimize digital supply chain planning, increased medical product visibility and supply chain agility. We're focusing initial implementation of Kinaxis rapid response platform with at home solutions with an expected completion date this summer. Furthermore, we've invested in a new warehouse management system across our at-Home Solutions Network, which we expect to roll out next week. This new infrastructure will improve labor planning based on demand, increased operating efficiencies to deliver on our commitments and streamline and standardize processes across our at-Home network. We're initiating a multi-year strategy to grow our warehouse footprint to our at-Home Solutions in target markets and we'll announce details for a new warehouse opening later this calendar year. And in our higher margin, technology enabled medical services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we've invested in additional technology capabilities to expand our offerings in both businesses. Turning to pharma, we continue to make progress on our two primary objectives. First, strengthening our core pharma distribution business. We have completed all deployments of our multi-year investment to modernize our pharmaceutical IT infrastructure in order to standardize operations, drive efficiencies and enhance the customer experience. These investments, including the automation of business procedures and real-time line of sight transparency for our employees and customers, will result in operational efficiencies and a more connected pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. We expect to benefit from the conversion in FY \u201923 and beyond. We're fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. Especially, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business, driven in part by the Navista TS, our technology platform for value-based care. In March, we further expanded our Navista TS offering with the launch of decision path, a digital solution to help oncology practices lower costs, improve patient care and drive success and transitioning to value based care. Created by Fuse, our internal innovation engine, decision path is built into electronic health record workflow allowing oncologists easily compare cancer treatment options, both by clinical indication and cost at the point of care. And with biosimilars, we are well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas incisive care. We believe the next phase of growth in the biosimilars market will predominantly come from products with a greater retail or specialty pharmacy presence as more retail products with interchangeability come to market. Our significant scale and capabilities designed to support retail pharmacies uniquely positioned us to support and empower those pharmacists as they navigate the important operational complexities of managing multiple biosimilar launches against major reference products. Our Kinaxis digital services portal offers tailored solutions to help patients get on and stay on therapy. Patients who interact with our Kinaxis portal experience shorter time therapy for new patients and no gaps in therapy for existing patients. Digital reenrollment via the patient portal increased approvals within the first 30 days by 10% and delivered a retention rate greater than 90%. In our third-party logistics business, we have 166 manufactured contracts this fiscal year. So far, we have successfully launched 27 manufacturers and we expect [five to eight] [ph] additional launches by the end of the fiscal year. And specific to cell and gene therapy, we continue to win opportunities and have plans to launch five manufacturers in the coming years based on FDA approval and manufacture readiness. In Nuclear, we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Theranostics. Our center for Theranostics advancement and in Indianapolis continues to be in high demand with a number of new innovators and products we are collaboratively doubling in FY '22 versus the prior year. Our outcomes business continues to add new payers, PBM pharmaceutical manufacturers and expand clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. We have combined a reimbursement consulting solution and outcomes connect platforms into a single unified platform that offers reimbursement assistance, decision support and scheduling to identify and complete clinical opportunities. Across the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify, and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing these cost reduction efforts with balanced discipline and shareholder friendly capital allocation according to our priorities. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. Now let me give a little color on injunctive relief as part of the national opioid settlement. Injunctive relief relates to controlled substance anti-diversion efforts and includes enhancements to governance, independence and training of personnel, due diligence for new and existing customers, ordering limits for certain products and suspicious order monitoring. In addition, we and the two other settling distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for 10 years. These relief measures are intended to create additional transparency. And while there is additional costs, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic. In closing, what we do matters, we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner by delivering the products and solutions our customers need, advancing health care and improving lives. And now, Jason, and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question guys up. Like, obviously, it looks like there were a number of items here in the fiscal third quarter, particularly the pharma segment, and you highlighted that we're going to be lapping a number of these as in the fourth quarter and you're maintaining the fiscal '22 guide in that segment. Can you just remind us what those items are that we're lapping now? I know that technology investments you mentioned is one. But could you kind of help us size those so we get a better sense? And is that then the right kind of jump off point in the pharma segment as we look into '23. And then, part of that you mentioned higher sort of operational expense and you kind of maybe highlighted inflation hasn't like wage inflation. You kind of mentioned that should mostly just be in the first half of the year. Can you touch on why that might only be a half year impact and not just a new baseline? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes. This is Jason. Let me go ahead and start. There's a number of questions. Hopefully, we can catch them all. So in terms of the IT enhancements, what we mentioned at the beginning of the year, and it's still very consistent with what we've seen rollout is about $80 million of incremental costs that we saw in '22 versus '21. And we indicated that would be spread somewhat evenly over the first three quarters of the fiscal year. So you can kind of think of roughly that 1/3rd per quarter is what we've been experiencing all year. First two quarters, we had other actions that drove growth above and beyond that headwind. But that was with the inflation included in the third quarter drove that 5% reduction. As it relates to the fourth quarter, the other unusual items -- beyond that lapping so there's very little year-over-year change as relates to IT enhancements in the fourth quarter. So that headwind goes away in Q4. But we also referenced last Q4' 21, that we had some unusual items that were adversely affecting us. So that becomes a year-over-year tailwind for us this Q4. And then in addition to that, we indicated here on the call today, just before this, that we're also seeing some volume underlying operational improvements that are expected for the fourth quarter that then would also continue on at that point. As it relates to inflation, what we saw here in the third quarter was elevated, it was a little bit higher than what we had expected. It is consistent with the range of our guidance. But nonetheless, it's an item that does impact our Q3 and we're expecting it to impact Q4. And then, carry over our comments for the first half of fiscal '23 are just presuming that costs will continue on at a similar elevated level and be a year-over-year headwind such that by the time we get to the second half of fiscal '23. It would then lap it at that point in time. Think I captured all your questions there. Operator : All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I recognize you had some unprecedented headwinds, but throughout the guidance has appeared to assume stabilization or improvement. And so we've seen step downs of 100 to 125, 150, 175 and now 300. It sounds like for '23, you're trying to let us know that we're going to be lapping and it doesn't get better, though there are actions being taken. Can you give us a feel for what actions you would take if it turns out that things continue to get worse? And have you thought about the profitability of elements of the business what might need to change or even whether the business might be better positioned for rebound if it's a multi-year rebound under someone else's ownership? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I'll take that and then Jason can fill in if I've missed any of the components of that. Thanks for the question. So, yes, well, we had said last quarter, we expected 250 to 300 of incremental cost. And now we think it'll be nearly 300. So that's adjusting the inflation component of it up to 300. And then, you also heard Jason comment in his comments that we saw some, as we look forward into Q4, we see some PPE cost, timing, and PPE volume impacts for us in Q4, that will also be an incremental negative for '22. So that's what's in our updated guidance to go to the new 45 to 55 down versus where we were before. So that's the change of the two key items that changed there. Again, there was some small stuff we mentioned in pharma and all that, we believe it's manageable within the guidance for pharma. So no call out any changing guidance for pharma. But that's the drivers for what we chose in medical. As far as looking forward to '23, what we are trying to indicate is that we do believe, as we annualize, if you think about the inflation increase over the year, and it sits in our inventory for a while. So using the $300 million, obviously, we believe that will annualize to a greater number next year. And so inflation actually on an absolute basis, the total impact of inflation will be greater next year in '23, than it was in '22. That's what we were talking about there. But then on the flip side, we also already has implemented price increases some in March and additional ones, as I mentioned, that go into effect here, essentially, July 1, that as we look at those and additional price increases that we would intend to take during the year that we also will see a greater positive impact from price increases next year. So while inflation on absolute will go up, the positives that we will get from increased pricing will also go up. And the two of those will net to a similar to slightly down overall net impact next year in '23. So that's how we're thinking about it next year, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to focus on those items and where we have opportunities based on the market, based on the conditions in costing, we will take more price to market. And what Jason also said to be helpful, our goal is that when we exit the year, next year, we plan to have at least 50% of those inflated items offset through either pricing actions that we will have taken either both to manufacturers and to customers, or we will obviously have seen some of those costs come back down. So we do plan to exit at that level. So that's kind of financially, I guess, an overall summary of that. To your question around the medical business, we still continue to feel very good about this business. As I look at this business overall, yes, our medical products and distribution business is having some challenges, no doubt about it, obviously, with lowering guidance three times. But when we look across the rest of the portfolio, whether it be at home, OptiFreight, Lab, WaveMark, we continue to see very strong growth from all of those businesses. And we feel really good about those. We feel good about the actions that we're putting in place. As always, we're always constantly because I'll look at our portfolio and make adjustments as necessary, but we feel good about where we are with medical at this point in time. Operator : And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and thanks for all the color. Mike, I want to dive in a little bit more about the comments you made tying into next year on medical. As we think about both the fiscal 3Q numbers and the implied fiscal 4Q guidance. Is that the right annualization and jumping off point as we think into next year and along those lines with the pieces that you've given us. Where do you see the dynamics, I know it's early, but around all these pieces coming together towards some level of EPS growth relative to long range planning. Jason hinted that you'll be below that. But should we expect to see EPS growth next year? Jason Hollar : Yes. So let me start with that. This is Jason. And the 23 elements that we are providing here for medical entirely focused on the inflation component, that is clearly going to be the most significant item that we are focused on for both the current year and what we know will impact us this next year. We have not -- this is not a full comprehensive guidance. And this is not meant to be complete with all the moving pieces. As Mike indicated, we're very focused on all those growth businesses that he mentioned, there's going to be other operational elements that we'll be working through. And that will provide more color on. As it relates to inflation that $300 million impact this year, is by far the most significant item. And when we think about our long-term targets, the reason we use the phrase normalized is items like that $300 million do need to be adjusted. But as it relates to other moving pieces for fiscal '23, that will come at our normal guidance update next quarter. Operator : All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Lisa Gill, JP Morgan. Lisa Gill : Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. Staying on the medical supply side of the business, I just want to better understand just a couple of things. Mike, you talked about the opportunity now to mitigate some of this by taking some price increases. Is there any reason I mean; we've been talking about all of these headwinds and pressures for several quarters now? Is there any reason why one, you haven't been able to do that historically? And why now you'll be able to do it. And then secondly, can you maybe just talk about the competitive landscape? Is there anything in the competitive landscape that has prohibited you from taking mitigating price increases during this time? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I would talk about it in two buckets. And as reminder, one, on the branded medical products, when we see price increases from those manufacturers, we are able to pass those through because it is like you're used to on the pharma side a cost-plus type of model. So whatever that cost is, we pass it on. So what we're talking about specifically here is the impact on Cardinal branded products, whether it be the Cardinal brand or Kendall, Curity, Kangaroo, all of our brands that we have, as we see input costs going up, whether that be transportation, ocean, freight, commodities, et cetera. Those are the types of things that are impacting. And so as again, as I think about the entire medical segment, remember, it is highly focused in this one area. As we look across the rest of the segment, we see really good progress on our initiatives and the various activities that we have going on. Specifically related to this to your point around taking pricing. As you know, taking pricing in this marketplace is complicated. First of all, you have to work not only with the actual customers themselves, but you also need to work with the GPOs and make sure that you are communicating what you intend to do when you'll do it, you have to give notice. Remember, in many cases, these are contracts that we have that could be multiyear contracts in place at a fixed price, because this is an industry that has historically not seen large fluctuations in pricing. It's been relatively stable in while you might see little things here and there. It's generally been very stable. And so the industry itself has been comfortable with doing longer term pricing. Obviously, that model needs to change going forward based on what we've seen in this hyperinflation environment that we're in that not only has occurred but seems to be lasting at least a little bit longer. And so this is about working with customers on redesigning the contracts, working with the GPOs working directly with the customers. We have been having those conversations. So we did take price increases on five categories, effective March 1. We recently added four more categories. This represents 1000s of SKUs. In fact, it's almost half of our Cardinal Health branded portfolio, we have now taken price on. And to your point, when we compete on products that's not just against the other distributors. And in fact, in most cases, it's against many other folks in the marketplace, including some of the branded suppliers. So we do have to understand what they are doing in the market and understanding how that as we raise prices, we still remain competitive in the best option for our customers. Operator : And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, couple of questions here. First of all, Mike, if we just step back, I think you talked in the prepared remarks about investing in building in a new facility in the medical segment. But if you really think back and we think about sort of the two segments that you have. Are there any synergies between drug distribution and medical segments in what is really the rationale to own a business on the medical side that has been underperforming for a very long time? Mike Kaufmann : Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Couple of things. As we've said before, we do see some synergies between M&P. We go to market together with our GPO selling teams. We share corporate overhead together. We work on our innovation and technology group. Together, we work together on back-office types of things. Clearly, acute care customers are common to both segments. We don't see as much synergy as between the large distribution businesses, obviously, because we maintained separate warehouses. And there's different needs for the customers there in terms of specific go-to-market strategies. But we do see it a lot with our complementary businesses. Our at-home business works with our pharma distribution business, our OptiFreight business works with them. So we do see working together there. So that being said, we do see opportunities, but as I've always said, we will always look at our portfolio. We will always look to see what is the best opportunity to create shareholder value. And so at this point in time, we feel good about where we are and where we're headed. But there's nothing off the table when it comes to looking forward in order to create value for shareholders. Operator : And our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the medical utilization assumptions embedded in sort of 4Q and then your comments regarding 2023, both maybe on the surgical side and at-home volumes? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. Right now, what we're seeing is, we're seeing elective procedures be pretty similar to what we would say pre-COVID. Now, that's a hard phrase to use anymore and it's probably one we'll begin getting away from because trying to measure something that's now over two years old, with lots of puts and takes with new items and changes in the marketplace and everything else. It's a little hard to compare to something that old at this point in time. But roughly what we would say is that elective procedures in Q3 were pretty similar to the prior couple quarters prior to and similar levels to pre-COVID. We expect about the same for Q4 and are not really expecting any differences in '23 as far as that goes in either direction. We're not expecting that there's a big build-up of unmet needs that are going to fly through the system, or vice versa, that we should see a significant reduction. Now, obviously, that could change if there's a flare up with COVID or something like that. But right now, we don't see anything at this point in time that we would forecast for the rest of this year next year as it relates to differences in elective procedures. Operator : And we'll take our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Jason, the med surg business, I'm going to stay on this one did about 60 million in EBIT in Q3. And that's kind of the midpoint of the Q4 guide. But as we think about your fiscal '23 comments, we know that inflation is building, and the impact tends to lag. I guess is the right way to think about med surg in fiscal '23, this is kind of the jumping off like the back half of fiscal '22 almost overstates the operating earnings run rate of the business. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the magnitude of how far down it can go in fiscal '23. And to what degree can pricing initiatives kind of offset that? Jason Hollar : Yes. The area I can probably be a little more helpful is on the timing associated with that the impact of that inflation from a year-over-year perspective will be more unfavorable in the first half of the year. If you think about what we had in fiscal '22, Q1 had much less of an impact actually hitting the P&L, we had seen the cost start to come -- start to build in terms of what was procured, but what actually hit the P&L escalated much more greatly in the second quarter and as increased from there in Q3 and Q4. So that comparison from a year-over-year perspective will be unfavorable for those elements, all things being equal. But given the magnitude of what we're talking about, I would expect that to be one of the more significant items, especially in Q1. And then, as we get to the back half of the year, as I indicated in my comments and Mike reiterated a few moments ago, with the expectation that we are able to offset about half of the run rate at the end of the fiscal year as we jump into '24, that would imply especially over the second half of the year, that would be trending more favorably, and then we would have a much more of a tailwind associated with those items. There are always other moving items within each year in our guidance. As you go back and look at all of our commentary this year, there have not been too many significant items referenced other than inflation. So this one singular item is going to be the key driver of the year-over-year results for the medical business next year. There will be other color, of course back to the growth businesses and other changes in underlying assumptions. But this will be driving the underlying performance for the segments very significantly from a year-over-year perspective. Again, in a general similar magnitude, perhaps, a modest headwind associated with it, based upon those underlying assumptions. Operator : And your next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just on the medical, I don't think you've given in a while, how much of the revenues there is Cardinal branded products at this point, roughly. And then, as you're talking about the offset that will come from pricing -- your price increases, offsetting about 50% by the end of next year of fiscal year. Are there any other things that are meaningful that could be impactful? I mean, I don't know diversification of sourcing, maybe toggling back and forth in the Cardinal brand and products. Anything else beyond just pushing through price increases? Or are we basically waiting for the backdrop to improve from a macro perspective? Mike Kaufmann : Yes. We don't -- we have not given any actual mixed percentages in terms of how much of our volume is Cardinal Health brand versus others. So I can't do that at this point in time. But what I will say is that there's opportunity for growth there. We know that's an area that we're excited about. We continue to put things in place like working on our incentives for our sales force, expanding our product line to have more items to drive mix to what you heard in my comments on what our project is doing with Avery Dennison and Innara Health. So we're both looking to expand the line as well as drive the mix through our sales reps and continuing to work with customers. So while we don't give it, it's an area where we do see some real opportunity going forward to grow. As far as other things to your point. So yes, number one is going to be pricing to customers that's going to be an issue. I also mentioned that we are taking fee changes to our manufacturing partners to increase the fees. Our costs, as we said have gone up, the service that we provide to manufacturers we believe is their best option to be able to get to market and get to the customers that we service. We want to obviously be fair with them and be a great and trusted partner. But we do need to make sure we're charging fairly for our services. So we have and our taking fee changes to those manufacturing partners that we have on the medical side in order to help compensate us for the great service that we drive there. We continue to look at our cost side of the business. We continue to feel good about our $750 million cost takeout and we're continuing to look at opportunities to be even more aggressive on that and we will continue to do that going forward. And then, in our growth businesses and focusing on those growth businesses, whether it be at-home or OptiFreight or Lab, we're continuing to make investments, as I noticed, noted around what we're doing with our lab business and a new facility to grow, that we've got some IT rollout of some new systems and OptiFreight and in our at-home business that are going to both improve our costs and increase our offerings. So those are the ways that we're going to be getting after over the next year and over the following years to grow this business. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Eric Coldwell : Hey, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the first question. I think it was Charles asked the pharma comp in 4Q '21. You identified some good guys from last year, you have not given more specifics today on what those are, I think, we're all pretty hectic with earnings and everything else a lot changed in last year. Can you just remind us what those items were in the fourth quarter of '21 that were that were bad guys? And how much they were? So we know what the year-over-year good guy comp is going into this quarter? And then, are there any new good guys, things the street wouldn't know about? That you know are going to hit in the fourth quarter that get you to your pharma profit margin target. Thanks very much. Jason Hollar : Yes. The primary item that we referenced last Q4 was inventory adjustments. We did not provide any specific number; I think we might have referenced modest. And so it was a reasonable number that you can look at the growth rates there and how that was impacted to provide a range. The key again, was that we no longer have the headwinds of that 20 million, 30 million per quarter that we've seen over the first three quarters related to the IT enhancements. And then, we have had some incremental volume through, we referenced some net new customer volume within the pharma business that started to ramp up in the third quarter and is more significant in the fourth quarter. And those will be the most significant items that drive at year-over-year. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great thanks. So regarding the elevated operating expenses in the pharma segment exiting '22, and into the first half of fiscal '23. I guess it's still not clear, which elevated cost categories you're able to pass through to customers, versus which ones you're absorbing in your own margins, when thinking about fuel costs, other transportation costs, higher labor expense, et cetera. So I guess just to confirm in which cost categories, are you seeing the greatest increase in the operating expenses that you're not able to pass through to the pharma customers? Thanks. Mike Kaufmann : Yes. I would say in general, the majority of these are not items that we can pass through, there are opportunities on fuel surcharges for sure, as those remain elevated to pass those through. But I would remind you, there was a couple other things. Some of these costs were also focused more on the third quarter such as we did roll out just a few weekends ago, the final rollout of our multiyear [PMOD] [ph] project. So we've had some rollout costs and some making sure that we do that right. In the quarter, we onboard some new customers during the quarter, and there's some initial costs there that we also incurred during the quarter. So I would say that the bucket is, there's a small amount that's passed through to the customers. There's another part that's a little bit, I would say temporary in the third quarter because they were unique to some work we're doing in the quarter, the majority is elevated transportation costs, that we do see more permanent for at least for a while until it begins to come back down across the portfolio and those are not able to be passed on. That being said, when we look at the level those the amount of costs we're taking out of the business. That's why we're still comfortable with reiterating our overall guidance for pharma that while they are somewhat elevated in the third quarter, there's something that we would expect and are continuing to address going forward to manage the both our guidance for this year as well as still feel confident about our longer-term guidance as it relates to Pharma. Jason Hollar : And just to be really clear in this point. We're not talking about any type of product cost inflation that's flowing through pharma business that is very much captured in the pass through. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Kaufmann, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Kaufmann : Just want to thank everybody for their time to be on the call today and I appreciate all the questions. I will just reiterate that we are taking action to mitigate these inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. And we're focused on driving improved performance across all of our businesses. Take care and I hope to talk to all of you soon. Bye-bye. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Moran : Good morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's Quarter and year-end fiscal 2022 results along with our outlook for fiscal year 2023. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.  Joining me today are Mike Kauffmann, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer; and Chief Accounting Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties.  Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Kaufmann : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As I am sure many of you have seen, a short time ago, we issued a press release, announcing that I am stepping down as CEO and as a Board member of Cardinal Health, but will continue to serve through August 31. Effective September 1, Jason will become Cardinal's new CEO. He has also been appointed as a board member effective today. They say timing is everything, and I believe as we start a new fiscal year, the time is right for me to step away as CEO and open the door for a new leader to take Cardinal Health forward over the coming years. I have been blessed to be part of the Cardinal Health family for 32 years. In that time, I've seen our company grow and evolve in many ways. We are truly essential to care, and I'm honored to have been part of it. Jason has been a tremendous partner over the past 2-plus years, and has been instrumental in many of our strategic initiatives. He deeply understands our business, priorities and industry landscape. And the board and I are confident that he is the right person for the job.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the kind words and the opportunity to work closely with you these past few years. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be taking on this new responsibility. I am grateful for the trust and the confidence the Board of Directors is placing me. I would also like to thank you, Mike, for the leadership and the many contributions to the company over the years. I hope to preserve the culture that you've helped ingrain into the fabric of our organization, and I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition. I also want to welcome Trish English, who will be serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Trish most recently served as our Chief Accounting Officer and has been a valuable member of the Cardinal Health family for over 16 years. I look forward to continuing to work with her in this new capacity while we conduct an external search for a permanent CFO.  Before stepping into the details of our financial performance for the quarter, let me step back and summarize the key points this past year. Within our Pharma segment, while we experienced the effects of industry-wide inflation and incurred incremental technology investments. We grew the business 5%, consistent with both our original guidance for the year as well as our long-term growth targets. The Medical business was more significantly impacted by these inflationary dynamics, which drove a significant impact on our results. However, we have strong mitigation actions in place, including pricing and will present a plan to you today that mitigates all of the inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts plus an additional 8% of compounded annual growth by fiscal '25.  Underlying these operating results this past year was a significant focus on cash flow, which results in increased financial flexibility. We are absolutely focused on shareholder value and intend to deploy these incremental funds to additional share repurchases for fiscal '23. While we remain in a dynamic environment, I'm excited to share further details of our plans with you today, and commit to continue to provide increased [indiscernible] drivers and the key metrics underlying our performance. So let's now turn to some of the details driving our results in the fourth quarter, beginning with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $43 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new PD and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 26% to $451 million driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand sales mix, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs.  As we've previously noted, this also reflects a favorable comparison due to the prior year inventory adjustments. During the quarter, our generics program, including Red Oak, saw strong performance and continued to experience consistent market dynamics. Regarding the inflationary supply chain costs, we saw impacts in areas that expectation and labor, which we expect to continue into next year. We also incurred higher cost supporting sales growth. And with ongoing progress in opioid litigation matters, we saw a decrease of approximately $15 million in opioid-related legal costs.  Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 11% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes. Medical segment loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter was due to net inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints and products and distribution. On a year-over-year basis, the favorable comparison to the prior year of $197 million PPE inventory reserve was mostly offset by the net inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts, a lower contribution from PPE and the Cordis divestiture.  During the quarter, our products and distribution business saw an approximate $100 million impact from net incremental inflation and supply chain constraints. This reflects a gross impact of approximately $125 million and approximate $25 million offset from our mitigation actions, which includes our initial wave of price increases on 5 Cardinal Health brand categories that went into effect back in March. I'll elaborate on our plans for further mitigation in fiscal '23 and beyond shortly.  As mentioned, it continues to be a highly dynamic medical environment, and our Q4 results came in lower than we had previously expected. This primarily reflects overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower contribution from PPE. Stepping back, Demand for PPE has fluctuated significantly over the past couple of years. We saw lower volumes as we exited Q3 and the fourth quarter experienced further declines. We believe this primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels and to a lesser extent, some PPE category-specific customer losses driven by supply constraints during the pandemic. We continue to have strong conviction in our overall value proposition, which includes leading brands and clinically differentiated products. For context, PPE represents approximately 15% of sales in our overall Cardinal Health brand portfolio, as you'll see on Slide 20.  Moving below line. Interest and other increased by $36 million to $64 million due to a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments compared to gains in the prior year. As [indiscernible] deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, a onetime write-down of an equity investment impacted EPS by $0.06 per share. The increase in other expense was partially offset by lower interest due to debt reduction actions. As indicated, we repaid the $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 25.4%, approximately 3 percentage points higher than the prior year. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.05, an increase of 36%, primarily reflecting the growth in pharma segment profit.  Now transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. Fiscal '22 revenues increased 12% to $181 million, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin decreased 3% to due to the Cordis divestiture. Total company SG&A increased 1%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, our previously mentioned IT investments and higher costs to support sales growth, mostly offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings decreased 12%, which primarily reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million related to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in medical, partially offset by Pharma segment profit growth. Interest and other increased 24% to $165 million, largely due to the items affecting the fourth quarter. Of note, this came in higher than our guidance primarily due to equity investment write-down in the quarter. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.1%. The net result was fiscal '22 EPS of $5.06. Now turning to the balance sheet. In fiscal '22, we generated robust operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. This includes the previously defined tax refund of nearly $1 billion and favorable timing of working capital. Additionally, in fiscal '22, we made approximately $500 million in litigation payments, primarily related to opioid settlements. In July, we made our second annual payment under the national opioid settlement agreement of approximately $375 million, which will be reflected in Q1 fiscal '23 operating cash flow. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. This year, we invested approximately $385 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down approximately $850 million in debt to reduce leverage and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  We ended the year with a cash position of $4.7 billion, which does reflect some timing favorability with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 14% to $165 billion, reflecting consistent drivers with the fourth quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 5% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by generics program performance and an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by investments in technology enhancements and inflationary supply chain costs. To be helpful, the tailwind from improved volumes and the headwind from incremental IT investments effectively offset in fiscal '22, each approximately $80 million on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw an approximate $50 million headwind from inflationary supply chain costs, primarily in the second half of the year.  Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Fiscal 22 medical revenue decreased 5% to , primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. To a lesser extent, lower products and distribution volumes were partially offset by growth in at-home solutions. Segment profit decreased 63% to $216 million, primarily due to the net inflationary impacts in global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. Additionally, the favorable comparison to the prior year PPE inventory reserve was offset by a lower contribution from PPE and the divestiture of the Cordis business.  Now for our fiscal '23 guidance. On Slide 13, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.40, which reflects the following assumptions : First, for the enterprise, we expect interest and other between $140 million to $170 million, which assumes approximately $550 million in debt paydown for the March 2023 notes at or before maturity. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding between $262 million and $266 million, reflecting our plan to complete between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases over the course of the year. And supporting our capital allocation priorities, we expect to adjust free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which excludes litigation payments and any other significant and unusual or nonrecurring items.  As for the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14%, driven by growth in existing and net new PD and specialty customers. We expect segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5% based on the following key assumptions. We expect continued stability in overall pharmaceutical volumes along with consistent market dynamics within our generics program. Continuation of the inflationary supply chain costs we've seen in the last 2 quarters should result in approximate $50 million headwind primarily in the first half of the year. The completion of ERP technology enhancements should be an approximate $30 million tailwind. We expect opioid-related legal costs, including initial costs for implementation of the settlements in adjunctive relief terms of approximately $80 million in fiscal '23, a $20 million tailwind. And we see increased contributions from our growth areas, primarily specialty, including biosimilars.  Before moving to Medical, a couple of points from the Pharma fiscal '23 . Similar to last year, we expect the year-over-year segment profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted, which primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of inflationary supply chain costs in the first half. Specifically, in the first quarter of next year, we expect segment profit between $400 million and $420 million. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought additional color may be helpful given the puts and takes over the last several quarters. Now turning to Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to decline in the range of 3% to 6% due to lower PPE sales and lab testing volumes. We expect segment profit ranging from a decline of 10% to growth of 10%, reflecting the following assumptions. We expect a similar net impact of approximately $300 million from inflation, global supply chain constraints and mitigation actions in fiscal '23 or a minimal impact on a year-over-year basis. This assumes an approximate $475 million gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints, partially offset by $175 million of mitigation actions, including pricing and evolving our commercial contracting. While still significantly elevated relative to historical levels, we're encouraged by the recent improvements in spot rates of certain cost drivers such as international freight and some commodities. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized and have historically been reflected in our P&L results on a 1 to 2 quarter delay. However, in the current period of elongated supply chains, it is closer to 2 quarters. Our current assumption is that the impact of inflation in global supply chain constraints will peak in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and gradually decrease over the next couple of years. Additionally, along with the pricing actions that went into effect at the start of the year, we are implementing additional ways of increases over the course of fiscal '23. We continue to expect that as we exit fiscal '23, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints.  In terms of other key assumptions for medical and fiscal '23. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we expect an approximate $50 million tailwind from an improvement in PPE margins. We plan to sell through the majority of higher-cost PPE in the first half of the year and for PPE margins to normalize as we exit the year. We expect the PPE tailwind to be offset by a similar headwind from lower lab testing volumes. We also anticipate a headwind of approximately $50 million from re-baseline incentive compensation following fiscal '22 underperformance. And finally, we expect increased contributions from our strategic growth areas, primarily at Home Solutions.  On Medical's quarterly cadence, while we are assuming a similar segment profit total in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22, we do expect the cadence to be the reverse of the prior year. Specifically, in the first quarter, we expect segment profit ranging from a loss of $20 million to profit of $20 million. We expect the gross impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints in the first quarter to be approximately $150 million, approximately 25% of this offset through our mitigation actions. As for the rest of the year, we expect the substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal '23, particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, global supply chain constraints, inflation mitigation and PPE. While there are many moving parts in fiscal '23, we are confident in our long-term outlook and our reiterating our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield over longer normalized periods. Additionally, we are introducing a new target for at least $650 million in Medical segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by the medical improvement plan that we are introducing today.  Slide 17 highlights our 4 areas of focus to improve medical performance. Number one, mitigate inflation and global supply chain constraints. We plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal '24 and are targeting to exit fiscal '23 offsetting at least half of the gross impact on our business. Our second wave of price increases went to effect on July 1 on 4 more categories. We plan on the next wave commencing on October 1. In addition, we've executed distribution fee increases for certain suppliers, and we are actively working with customers and GPOs to adjust language in our product and distribution contracts as they renew, allowing for greater price flexibility to respond to current and future macroeconomic dynamics. Two, optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand portfolio. Our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio, which includes nearly $4 billion of non-PPE categories, offers leading brands and clinically differentiated products. Plan to grow Cardinal Health brand sales by a compounded annual growth rate of at least 3%, which will generate $75 million or more of incremental segment profit over the next 3 years.  This growth will be achieved through 2 key areas of focus. First, R&D and new product innovation. We see opportunities in key categories such as new nutritional delivery, where we will be launching the next-generation Kangaroo [indiscernible] feeding platform. Second is increased product availability as a result of investments within targeted categories such as surgical gloves and electrodes. For example, in our surgical glove portfolio, we are investing $125 million for construction of a new manufacturing facility dedicated to increased supply for leading for Texas brand gloves. Third area of focus is to accelerate our our growth businesses, primarily at Home Solutions. These businesses have growth rates in excess of our core, along with a higher margin opportunity, and we've been making investments to drive at least $60 million of total segment profit by fiscal '25. At Home Solutions, for example, is now a $2.4 billion business that has consistently grown top line at around 10% as patient care continues to shift into the home. And finally, our fourth area of focus is to continue our simplification and cost optimization efforts. We expect actions that increased productivity in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, supply chain and back office to yield at least $50 million of net cost savings by fiscal '25.  Going forward, we are focused on driving simplification through value improvement projects, transportation management and further optimizing our sourcing and manufacturing footprint where possible. We expect these initiatives to contribute towards exceeding our existing enterprise $750 million cost savings goal by fiscal '23. While on the topic of our supply chain, let me take a moment to share some additional color where we have received a number of investor questions. We operate a highly diverse global supply chain with approximately 2/3 of our Cardinal Health brand revenue coming from self-manufactured products. We have invested in additional self-manufacturing capabilities, many in our own North American facilities. And today, approximately half of our Cardinal Health brand revenue comes from North America in total. To best serve our customers, we continue to believe in the importance of a diverse global supply chain, and we are focused on responding to any global supply chain disruptions with resilience and agility. In summary, we believe the introduction of measurable proof points in each of these 4 areas of focus provides visibility to measure progress against our plans going forward.  Now let's turn to the Pharmaceutical segment where we continue to focus on strengthening our core PV business and investing in our growth businesses, primarily specialty. In Pharma Distribution, with our significant technology enhancements that we've been working on over the past several years, substantially completed, we now focus our attention on increasing productivity, maximizing working capital efficiency and prioritizing the customer experience. With our generics program anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak, we continue to further enhance our capabilities as we focus on share of wallet and maximizing margins. We recently held our Retail Business Conference where over 4,000 customers attended live for the first time in 3 years and had an opportunity to see and experience our latest innovations. We also had the chance to register for services that would help them create an online shopping portal, advisory support to optimize reimbursement and central fill compliance packaging services.  In specialty, we are continuing to see downstream momentum in oncology and emerging therapeutic areas driven by our offerings, including the Vista TS. We announced a tuck-in acquisition of the Bank care GPO and investment in their main services organization. These will further strengthen Specialty Solutions cornerstone rheumatology GPO, which offers innovative office management solutions and robust specialty drug access to over 1,300 rheumatology providers nationwide.  Upstream with biopharma manufacturers, we are investing for future growth in our 3PL business as evidenced through our cold chain storage expansion, which increases our current capacity by 200%. We also continue to see strong growth in SynXis our patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care. And with biosimilars, we are proactively addressing common barriers to adoption by investing in education campaigns to build awareness, clinical comfort and ensure accessibility. We continue to be excited about the future growth in the space and remain well positioned as new biosimilars come to market. In closing, while there's a lot of work to be done, I'm excited to work with our 44,000 teammates and executing our plans to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond. With that, I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question today from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : I want to say best of luck to you, Mike Kaufmann, it's been great working with you all these years. And I look forward to hopefully staying in touch. And congratulations, Jason, on becoming CEO. I really want to start with -- obviously, you talked about this huge ramp getting the medical side of the business back to $650 million of profit. And Jason, you just talked about 4 different areas. I really want to just focus on the first area, and that's growing Cardinal brand products. And obviously, for someone like myself that's followed the company for a long time, has kind of ebbed and flowed as far as the focus of the company? Can you talk about, one, why now you think that you can really accelerate that? Two, I think you talked about nutritional. We've had others that have had problems in that area, right? Why do you think that, that's a good area for Cardinal to go into? And then secondly, when we think about physician preference, et cetera, what are you hearing in the market around private label product to give you some of the insights as to the opportunities that you see here specific to Cardinal brand products. So I'll stop there. Jason Hollar : Yes. Great less to start off the discussion. Thanks, Lisa. So first of all, let's start with your first one there about why now. So ebbs and flows. I understand what you mean. And of course, I think what you're referring to is we especially talked about the sales force right before the pandemic. We've made a significant restructuring to have that team very much focused on driving our Cardinal brand mix and then COVID occurred and it went from a sales-focused challenge to now a supply chain challenge. And of course, our sales team as well as our customers were very much focused on PPE and in giving care to COVID patients and the change in the mix was not exactly the highest priority. So I think it's always been a focus of Cardinal, but we recognize that we needed to change our priorities to align with our customers' priority over the last couple of years. But behind the scenes, especially with the pandemic, our medical team realized that we needed to invest in our own supply chain capability, our own products and a lot of the capacity that is necessary for the manufacturing, either whether it's our own products or source products to ensure further resiliency.  So now that we are getting a little bit more normalized, and we see that we have to invest in that supply chain, it not only helps provide resiliency to our customers, but also allows us to grow high-margin products where we have the right to win and expand our margins further. So now is the right time as we start to move on and allow our sales team to get reengaged and focus on driving that volume. But of course, we need the capacity and the products to allow them to be successful. You asked a specific question about nutritional. That's just one area, right? We have a very broad, diverse product when we are successful in the category today. The King Group brand is a market leader. So this is not necessary we're getting into it. In fact, that's what gets me so excited about this item, it's opportunity. The 2 items I referenced, the surgical gloves and nutritional are already areas were significant leaders we are with good margins, good growth. We have the opportunity to just get our leadership through additional products and additional capacity. So it's actually a lower with risk strategy than entering in separately.  As it relates to your last question, again, we have a very broad, diverse products, and we can manufacture. We can source and we are to use all tools available to us and use that diverse capability, internal external with partners or ourselves and continue to adapt and evolve as the market demands and when we look at the supply chain state that go behind that. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George Hill : And Mike, I'll echo Lisa's comments and wishing you well. And I guess, Jason, I don't mean this question to sound insensitive, but I guess given the company's recent performance, could you talk about why the Board choose to not run a process to replace Mike? And why you guys kind of went with an internal promotion? And just kind of -- I don't know if you're able to comment at all, just kind of on the board's perception of company performance and how it kind of wants to evaluate management going forward? Jason Hollar : I certainly will not attempt to speak for the Board, but what I will say is that my time both here as well as elsewhere in industry, I'm very focused, very tenured on driving operational performance within the business. I have made a mark within this organization. I've been very focused on capital deployment, driving cash in the company and have made that impact. When I think about what -- why I feel like I'm the right person going forward here, we have a lot of great assets within the organization. We have a wonderful culture. We have wonderful products, leading positions, great growth areas. But with the pandemic has shown us is that we need to go back to some level of basics here in terms of the operational core and driving efficiency, driving simplification, so probably doing fewer things, but doing them better. And that focus and that attention to derisking the model and driving this profit improvement plan for the Medical business. The pharma business has been very resilient. We hit our both short- and long-term goals this year. We need to keep doing more of the same, while also continuing to grow those growth areas, of which, of course, specialty is the largest one. So we're in a very different phase there. And then with this plan today, we're really highlighting how aggressive we're going to be with our capital deployment that when we generate that cash, $3.1 billion in '22, we're going to deploy it effectively. I'm well positioned to take us through those challenges that we've been faced with and I am going to be absolutely focused on taking the next steps here. Operator : We now move to A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : It's [indiscernible] on for A.J. I just want to echo my congrats on Jason and Mike as well. So you mentioned the various costs have been coming down within the Medical segment and understanding there is a lag between when the spot prices come down versus when it flows through your P&L. Should we take it that any further decline in the spot prices would be upside to the medical outlook for FY '23 and beyond? And then alongside that, you talked about the 3% revenue CAGR for the Cardinal Health brand products. I guess what are you assuming in terms of pricing growth moving forward and alongside that utilization? Jason Hollar : Okay. So to start with the spot prices. Well, that's why we always talk about the net impact is because obviously, there's a gross impact and the pricing and other contracting items that create that net. And so as I think about that dynamic in the short term, as I think you indicated and understand, it depends on what it is, right? It's inventory costs like the freight -- international freight, the product freight or the commodities that will be rolled in and that will be more of that 2-quarter lag.  But as it relates to the domestic transportation, that piece, which hasn't moved very much in either direction, that is a little bit more real time. So it kind of depends on what costs you're talking about. Long term, we believe there's going to be a parity to pre-pandemic levels for this. So if costs weaken, get lower then some of the pricing actions may change. In the near term, I don't think pricing is going to change. Under all these pricing scenarios, we're still not covering -- expected to cover more than half of that impact. So overall, we think in the short term, yes, the costs are going to flow more to minimizing the impact of what we have. But again, that would be most likely in the second half of the year.  In terms of the 3% CAGR I'm not sure I fully understand the price question there. But within our Cardinal Health, it's specifically related to that $4 billion bucket that I referenced in my comments that the underlying volume is what that's related to. There is pricing that goes along with that. But I would say it's more on the volume side and the pricing side that's driving that type of CAGR. It's not double dipping on the pricing actions. That is presuming a normalized level of inflation in pricing, and so then it would be more a volume driving that incremental value Operator : Moving to Michael Cherny of Bank of America. Michael Cherny : And Mike, obviously, same here, but I wish you best wishes as you move on. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. maybe, Jason, to dive a little bit also into the medical transformation plan as you think about the totality of Cardinal as you step into the CEO seat. As you think about the moving pieces that you have and the drivers to push back towards growth, can you give us a sense as well on how much the linkage between the pharma and medical side will be able to help allow you to hit these targets that you've laid out? And how do you view the synergies, especially among this revamped medical outlook between these 2 segments going forward? Jason Hollar : Yes. So when I step back and think about that plan, the area that is -- there's a couple of areas that could be impacted that have connectivity there. Probably the first one is the simplification and continued cost optimization. Those types of initiatives are wide ranging. And as we implement a particular project to reduce cost. It's a lot of cherry picking between the segments and the corporate functions, when one person has a good idea, we push those across all of them. And in some cases, we're leveraging that scale. We're doing a lot of centralization of work to standardize and offshore back-office activities, things of that nature, using digital tools that when we can invest in those types of technologies and capabilities essentially and blow that out to the whole organization. So that's certainly a piece of it. And then when we talk about the -- growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, while there's not a lot of crossover selling, we do have the same customers. And so those relationships, those discussions can spot into a variety of different opportunities. So that's not a huge enabler of that type of item, but it could be a component of it. And I would say that, that's probably the areas that there's the most overlap. Operator : We move now to Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Best wishes, Mike and excited to where we see in your new role. As I have a question just in terms of -- you talked about, I think, on the last call that you had gotten sort of 50% of SKUs sort of at a higher you've been able to pass through higher costs there. I was wondering if you could update that because I know you said in your slides, obviously, you were going to have offset about 50% of that gross impact exiting '23, and I know there are a variety of things in there. So I was just wondering if you could update us on that. Jason Hollar : Yes. So that reference to 50% of SKUs was reflective of the expected July 1 price increases. So that is effective July 1. Now since then, we've now discussed and are informing everyone of the October 1 increases. I didn't provide that exact number. But remember, that's just the percentage of SKUs that we're touching. I think the more important way to think about it is the percentage of mitigation that we're targeting. So let me kind of walk through the flow and how I think you should think about it for this upcoming year. So as an anchor point, I just walked through in the prepared comments, in Q4 '22, what we just finished is about a 20% mitigation. So we indicated there was a $125 million gross impact with $25 million of pricing. So a 20% mitigation.  We expect that 20% with the July increases and phasing in over the quarter, that's going to increase that to 25% average for the first quarter of '23. Now we would expect that to continue to increase each and every quarter over the course of the year as we roll through various other increases. I mean these are the big ways, but there's always going to be other increases along the way and our supplier fees that go along with this, too. And then that 25%, we expect to double by the time we exit fiscal '23. So we expect a run rate of about 50% by the time we exit fiscal '23. And then as I indicated in my comments, we would expect to exit fiscal '24 with 100% mitigation. By the time you get to the end of '24, we would expect that part of this inflation continues to come down. So our growth impact in '24 would trend lower and then our pricing would trend higher until effectively, those 2 numbers offset. Operator : We now move to Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steven Valiquette : I also just want to congratulate Mike on rewarding 30-plus years at Cardinal. And Jason here, so you hoping you'll have 30-plus years at Cardinal's well I think it put you in your late 70s, but I think you can do it. Jason Hollar : [Indiscernible]. Steven Valiquette : Just the 10% to 14% revenue growth in pharma jumped out is pretty high. I guess I was curious for more color on the drivers of growth within that as for fiscal '23, obviously, more color around the double-digit top line within the pharma Jason Hollar : Sure. Well, yes, no, yes, okay. Got it. I think there's a couple of key points. First of all, it's very consistent with what we've done this past year and that was driven by a couple of key drivers. And I think you should think about the drivers as being similar because one of the drivers we've referenced a few times is some net new business that we referenced team in beginning in the third quarter of '22. So that would be a little bit more of a front-end loaded type of revenue benefit as we see fiscal '23. And then we've also been highlighting the strength in our large customers large book PD specialty. And we've seen some really good volume in the brand category. And so as you know, some of that larger customers and some of the brand volume doesn't always bring with it a tremendous amount of margin, but that's one of the reasons why you see very robust revenue growth and still profit growth well within the range of what we've indicated for both our short- and long-term goals. But those are the biggest drivers. Operator : Next, we move to Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Rivka Goldwasser : And Mike, on my very best wishes and Jason, congrats and good luck. So a couple of follow-up questions here. So just to get a sense -- and Jason, thank you for clarifying the $150 million in a headwind -- in gross headwind in the first quarter versus the $125 million. So as we think about it seems like you're -- in your guidance, right, you're assuming that the headwinds are going to get worse in the first quarter versus the run rate, the run rate? I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about this correctly, and then we'll will slowly improve throughout the year. As we think about the mitigation, I think your numbers imply about $38 million, right, in mitigation from better pricing in the first quarter. When you're saying 50%, should we assume basically double from that to $75 million. I just wanted to kind of like understand the reference of that 50%.  And then an additional question on the the Cardinal brand because it seems that that's a really important part of sort of the longer-term plan. It seems that it's about 29% of revenue for the segment that comes from Cardinal Health brand. So one, how do you envision this revenue mix, what it will be by 2025? And then -- how should we think about sort of the EBIT mix? It's 29% of revenue? What percent is it of profits today? Jason Hollar : Okay. Okay. So starting with the pricing. I think you got it fairly close, but let me clarify a few points. Yes, on -- you got the math right for Q1 that would be pretty close to how you should think about it. So yes, the gross impact is increasing a little bit from the $125 million in Q4 to the $150 million in Q1. And that is -- just to make sure we connect all the dots. Yes, spot prices, we see are starting to soften in a few areas, not all areas of some going dose direction too. But generally speaking, there's some benefit there, which but it's not impacting our P&L because it's got that 2-quarter lag. So when you think about when the international trade specifically it started reducing dramatically about 2 months ago -- 2, 3 months ago, there was a really big reduction. So you wouldn't expect that and it didn't reduce -- there's been a consistent reduction over the last several weeks. So it's going to take some time for that to flow through. So certainly, Q1 can see any of that benefit. And that's why you see the growth impact still increasing is because that's from 5, 6 months ago as well. As we think about the exit and you're trying to get the math on the pricing, is the pricing double from that probably not because what you're missing, I think, in your math is that, that $150 million should come down over the course of the year. We are anticipating it will come down in part because of that international freight. So that will begin to come down and then pricing will continue to go up. But by the time we exit, again, that exit rate would be around that 50%. But but lower than the $150 million and higher than the $37 million, $38 million from the first quarter. As it relates to the revenue mix, that's hard to say. I I'm not ready to answer that specifically. The one thing I'll highlight is, as we indicated, $2.4 billion of revenue for at Home is a meaningful number when you look at that. So as a matter of -- are you doing calculations on the full segment or only on medical products and distribution at $2.4 billion of revenue, it's been growing consistently at 10%. We expect to continue growing robustly. And so that will, in a way, have a mix effect, so a percentage of revenue in the total segment, that will be a bigger piece of medical product distribution, most likely the smaller piece. So we'll need a little bit more math before we can respond more clearly on that one. Operator : We now move to Eric Percher of Nephron Research. We move to our next question, Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Mike, congratulations and best wishes with everything and Jason, I look forward to working -- continuing working with you. I wanted just to maybe follow up, Jason, you talked about really using the cash and deploying it. And obviously, you outlined an amount for share repurchase. When you think about getting to the $650 million sort of target in medical operating profit. Can you talk about maybe sort of M&A or other kind of capabilities that you might want to add? I know that we spent the last few years actually divesting assets. But is part of that growth inorganic as well? And then secondly, producer price index kind of fell below -- was below what people expected. When we think about the gross impact from inflationary pressures, are you starting to see some of that ease as well given sort of this July report? Jason Hollar : Okay. So the short answer for the medical improvement plan is no, M&A is not a cornerstone of that plan. We will be looking to always augment, especially our growth businesses. So when I -- when we talk about that second point, accelerating our growth business primarily at Home Solutions, that is very much an organic investment story. We are investing in distribution capacity, that 10% growth does mean that we have some constraints and we need to invest in that to ensure that, that business can continue to grow profitably. So that is not a cornerstone. In fact, I would say maybe a little bit of the opposite. A lot of what this plan is, is very focused on the core. It's very focused on -- we have -- we just increased our CapEx guidance this year from where it's been in the past.  That was hinted at and signaled last quarter where we talked about some of these capacity investments that, again, we still are relatively low risk and a good return. So it's more of that type of investment that we're focused on and that we believe is a better balance of risk and return as we drive this plan forward. We won't ever ignore it, and it could be a pillar -- or I'm sorry, it could be an enabler at some point later on, but it's not the focus and not necessary for what we're doing.  As it relates to PPI, I think just one maybe I kind of talked about a lot of the pieces, but one area that is often referenced as a key driver for a lot of our cost is just oil in general. That has come down. So PPI in general, I don't pay much attention to. I do look at the price of oil at least 2, 3 times today. It does have an impact on a lot of input costs and we talk about polypropylene, polyethylene, polystylene, all these poles have some input costs that are petroleum based that does impact it.  But the supply demand dynamics are so wonky right now that it's hard to see a one-for-one transition of these input costs. And I think at some point, that will come through, but we're really not seeing it that much. We are seeing lower diesel costs. So that's going in the right direction. That I would expect at some point will help with the transportation rates, but we're not necessarily seeing those elements, where it is most striking is the international freight. And that continues to be the one that is clearly running lower but it's just going to take time for that to run through our P&L. But I wouldn't call that an inflation-driven or input cost-driven point, the cost of diesel fuel for a freight as small. It's the supply and demand dynamics that we're all out of whack early on the pandemic that appear to be getting a bit more in line. That's why at this point, I believe that, that cost will maybe not keep going down at the pace of that going down, but it does feel like we're seeing more flat and down days for those costs than updates everything else, we're going to have to get more data to be able to provide additional input. Operator : We now move to Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Again, congrats to both you, Mike and Jason. I guess my question is going back to the Medical segment. There's a lot of execution that needs to take place between now and 2025 to hit these targets. Are you happy with the team in place? How do you enhance your probability of success here internally? Is it bringing in new people, more people? Or do you feel the team in place can do it?  And the second part of that question is a lot of this is price increases, which you've talked about, how are you competitively position now when it comes to price? You talked earlier about losing some share in medical because of PPE capacity and availability earlier. How are you now positioned competitively when it comes to pricing? And are customers asking for any offsets anywhere else? I know you talked about some guarantees and the like, but I just want to understand the competitive positioning as well. Jason Hollar : Yes, I am happy with the team in place. This is our plan. They've been working on this for quite some time. We have shared elements of it conceptually with our investors with you all in the past. What this is doing is putting a finer point on this plan and making it more visible the commitments that we're making. We are leaning into some of the investments I mentioned before, especially on the CapEx. I do think that we need to continue to augment some of the capabilities. We have several very key new team members on that team that when you think about a lot of the supply chain challenges that we're talking about over -- especially this past year and even with last quarter, we have augmented the team significantly with terrific talent, industry relevant talent, but most importantly, product talent, talent that knows the supply chain knows manufacturing that was able to make an immediate impact in finalizing this plan and allowing us to take it over line. So I would not be presenting it this way if I didn't have the confidence that we have the people behind it to actually execute it. The other thing I'll say about a plan like this is I absolutely understand the intent of your question. because there are several things that need to happen here. And one thing I've learned in my 2 years here is that it's not what's on the piece of paper that ends up taking a sideways. It's the things that are unforeseen, like COVID and like inflation. And so with that said, that's why you see after every single one of these actions, at least or $60 million plus or $50 million plus is because our internal plans are definitely more aggressive than this. And we know that there's going to be some unforeseen things that are going to make us exceed some of these items so that we can hit it.  So yes, a lot of execution, but we have the team and we have the plan in place, and that's where we have to start. As it relates to your question on competitiveness, I think I'd like to answer that maybe a little bit more broadly because let's just talk about inflation. As long as we have a cost competitive sourcing, manufacturing footprint, then inflation that we incur absolutely needs to be pushed down to the final customer. By its nature, inflation in most industries, the most periods of time, don't get absorbed in the supply chain, there's not -- especially in distribution, there's not the margin to absorb inflation. And so when that higher cost with the industry's cost over a longer period of time, we would expect that to flow generally speaking. But how you get there is a very choppy type of process. That's why this is taking 2, 3 years. It's also certainly because of the contracting nature where a lot of this is rolling over into more permanent contracts in addition to shorter-term actions. So there's nothing about industry dynamics. There's nothing about our competitiveness that indicates that we should be losing margin here. We have to be versatile and move our supply chain if we're uncompetitive in a particular area. But if we're competitive on a cost perspective, there's no reason we can go back to historical margins. Operator : We now take our last question today from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Am I coming through this time? Michael Kaufmann : Yes. Eric Percher : Perfect. So Jason, as you take on the new role, I think a couple of questions came down to what you will do different. And what I heard during the call was you've had a desire to be more aggressive on returning capital to shareholders and opioid settlement behind you, strong balance sheet. We're going to see that I heard the focus on cost management. I want to ask if there are other elements that you think are important for us to understand. And then I want to also ask pointedly, will you reassess the portfolio and consider what hedging needs to be together long term? Jason Hollar : Yes. So let me start. Whenever I step into any project let alone a role, it is always about defining we're the best opportunity to create value. Where is the opportunities, what are the challenges? And what is clear to me is that until we can get better evidence of the progress on our medical business, we're going to be challenged. And so that is why I'm so focused on this medical improvement plan, why we provided such clarity on it is that it is absolutely one of, if not my greatest focus especially in the near term.  And when you think about kind of any type of process to fix anything, it has to be, first and foremost, defining what the challenge is. And I do want to step back for a moment. When you think about the challenges in the medical, I know there's been a lot of adjustments. I know there's been a lot of noise. But when you think about the vast majority of the issues, they do stem from one very common theme, it is related to the supply chain.  Now I can start and highlight all the external influences with that and blame things that have happened to us, and then it's very, very true. But when you think about where we were pre-COVID, this type of business, this type of industry was extremely stable. Our volume is predictable, especially in areas like PPE to think about going up 5x, 10x in terms of demand overnight and then not having a supply chain that could adjust with that, it really impacted our ability to execute in that environment in our diverse, low-cost global footprint what went from a strength to a challenge pretty much overnight. So now we've learned from that. That's what this plan is talking about. It's building in resiliency and capacity into our system so we can be a lot more flexible. We can derisk the model while also growing profitable categories.  So this is very much a cornerstone of what needs to be the focus, but it's not not just cost. It's simplification to reduce cost. It's also about driving the right time, driving organic binding high-margin volume in simplifying everything about how we operate so that we can be more nimble and we can derisk. And then, again, within both segments, there is an absolute need to continue to grow our growth businesses. What you heard me say today was more of an emphasis on specialty and on at home. Of course, we love all of our growth businesses. But what I'm really indicating here is for us to achieve the $650 million what we need are those 2 businesses to continue to grow the top line and to have a good flow-through on that incremental volume that comes with it. And with that, then we have high confidence that we'll be able to get the pieces of growth for both segments necessary to hit their longer-term objectives.  So that is very much a growth-based story, but it's about, again, prioritization and being really, really focused on the core of both businesses so that these 2 growth businesses can build from there. In terms of the portfolio, it's something that I believe in continually evaluating our portfolio for all of our businesses. And the company has demonstrated this in the past. You know about China and not of health and more recently, ports. We've monetized several billion dollars over the last several years through those activities and was responsible with the capital deployment thereafter. I'm not going to attempt to define what the appropriate long-term course of action is for this business for the medical business. But under all scenarios, what's really, really clear to me that the near-term actions need to be very focused on this improvement plan and then that will set us up for the best actions thereafter. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks. Michael Kaufmann : Thank you. Before Jason ends the call, I would like to say that I appreciate all of your congratulations and comments and enjoyed working with all of you. I look forward to a smooth transition with Jason, and have complete confidence in his leadership. Jason, to you. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I want to also thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call today and for all your questions. In addition to the leadership succession, I acknowledge that we drew a lot out of you today, including new disclosures, various puts and takes and examples of incremental actions that we are taking. We did all this in an effort to provide additional visibility as we are confident and excited about these opportunities to drive growth. But there are 3 key takeaways I want to make sure that you have,  First, we are committed to improving our results as demonstrated by the introduction of our medical improvement plan. Second, we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our Pharma segment, which continues to meet both our short and long-term objectives. And third, that we continue to take actions that are in our shareholders' best interest.  With that, thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. During the Q&A portion of today's call, we please ask that you try and limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Now that I've had a couple of months to settle into the CEO role, I'm feeling even more energized and excited about the opportunities in front of us. By recent conversations with customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders have reinforced my perceptions that our company's role in healthcare and our mission to improve the lives of people every day remain as critical as ever. Our customers and their patients rely on us to deliver the right products to the right places at the right time. And yet, there's also a collective recognition of the need for simplification, focused execution and clarification of our company's strategic direction. Our goal today, along with reviewing our recent results is to summarize the key near-term priorities and progress to date on our plans, which I will discuss later in my remarks. However, before I turn it over to Trish, let me share some initial perspective on the first quarter. Overall, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued stable fundamentals in our largest business and tangible progress in Medical. In Pharma, we tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, as we delivered growth while managing industry-wide inflationary headwinds. We are encouraged by the ongoing stability in prescription volumes and strong performance of our generics program. In Medical, the quarter's results were also a little better than expectations we announced in September. While I'm pleased with our team's efforts in the quarter to achieve these results, there is more work to be done to drive better, more predictable financial performance in line with the underlying potential of this business. We are highly focused on executing our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives, which I'll cover in greater detail later in my remarks. Across the company, our team is operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward and committed to creating value for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Trish to dive deeper into our results and outlook. Trish English : Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you all. Today, I'll share details on three areas of focus. Our consolidated first quarter results, the key drivers underlying our segment's performance and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook before turning it back to Jason for final remarks. First quarter total company revenue increased 13%, driven by Pharma segment sales growth. Gross margin decreased 2% to $1.6 billion, due to net inflationary impact in medical and one month impact of the Cordis divestiture, partially offset by our Pharma Generics program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 7%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and other operating expenses such as higher costs to support Pharma sales growth. This increase was partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings decreased 20% to $423 million, reflecting the decline in Medical segment profit, primarily due to net inflationary impact, and partially offset by growth in Pharma segment profit. Now moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased 25% to $27 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 16.9%, approximately 7 percentage points lower than prior year due to certain favorable discrete items. Diluted weighted average shares were $273 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. We are focused on balanced disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital deployment and in mid-September, we initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to complete in the second quarter. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $1.20. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We generated first quarter operating cash flow of approximately $25 million. This includes total litigation payments of approximately $390 million, primarily consisting of the second payment under the national opioid settlement. Adjusted free cash flow in our first quarter was $342 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.5 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 15% to $46 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Pharma segment profit increased 6% to $431 million, driven by Generic program performance and a higher contribution from Brand and Specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we were pleased to see strong execution and continued consistent market dynamic in our generic program including Red Oak. As we previously note, inflation continue to impact supply chain cost across the industry, particularly within transportation and labor. We saw an approximate $20 million year-over-year headwind from these areas, which was consistent with our expectations. This headwind was effectively offset by year-over-year tailwind on from our completed ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on slide 6. First quarter revenue decreased 9% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to PPE pricing and volumes, and to a lesser extent, the Cordis divestiture. Continued strong growth in our at-Home Solutions business offset some of this revenue decline. Medical segment loss of $8 million was due to net inflationary impact in products and distribution, as well as a lower contribution from PPE, both of which I will discuss in more detail. Importantly, these results reflect approximately $20 million in total inventory charges related to our previously announced simplification actions. This includes the sale of our gloves portfolio that is primarily utilized in non-health care industries. As a reminder, this non-core product line has been a source of volatility and distraction in recent years. These actions, despite the one-time costs are an example of our ongoing commitment to strengthening the medical product and distribution business through simplification. During the quarter, the growth impacts from * incremental inflation in our product and distribution business was in line with our expectations of approximately $150 million, and we successfully achieved our inflation mitigation target of 25%. Our mitigation efforts have continued to accelerate, most notably with the implementation of the second wave of product pricing actions in July. Jason will elaborate on our plans for further mitigation shortly. Now, a quick update on the overall utilization environment. We've previously noticed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower demand for PPE, which we believe primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels. In the first quarter, we saw generally consistent overall products and distribution volumes sequentially, including with PPE. While we do anticipate gradual improvement in volumes relative to these recent lows, we continue to expect choppiness in demand levels going forward. Now for our fiscal 2023 outlook, beginning on slide eight. We are reiterating our EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.40. This includes our updated medical segment outlook, which has been adjusted for the impact of simplification actions in the first quarter and a few below-the-line improvement. Based on the first quarter performance, we are confident in lowering the top end of the ranges for interest and other, our effective tax rate and diluted weighted average shares for the fiscal year. We now expect I&O in the range of $140 million to $160 million, an ETR between 23% and 24% and diluted shares between $262 million to $264 million. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on slide eight remain unchanged. We are also reiterating our fiscal 2023 outlook for the Pharma segment seen on slide nine. We continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14% and segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Before transitioning to medical, two key call-outs on the Pharma cadence. First, with stronger start to the year, we now expect more balanced year-over-year profit growth between the first and second half of fiscal 2023. And specifically, for the second quarter, we expect segment profit dollars to be similar to the first quarter. Now turning to Medical. We expect segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%, which, as I indicated, reflects the impact of the simplification actions in the first quarter. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, there is no change to our expectation of a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic. And while we've seen some decreases in spot rates of certain cost drivers, such as international freight, other areas such as commodity costs remain significantly elevated. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory. And in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two-quarter delay. While we now expect growth inflation in the second quarter to be similar to what was seen in Q1, we are implementing additional actions and working proactively to mitigate these pressures. It's important to note that, we continue to expect that as we exit the year, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the growth impact from inflation. On Medical's quarterly cadence, in Q2, we expect similar segment profit dollars since the first quarter, excluding the impact of the first quarter simplification actions. As we have noted before, we continue to expect a substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal 2023 and particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, inflation mitigation and PPE. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Trish. I concluded our August earnings call with three key takeaways that, I'd like to provide updates on, number one, improving the underlying performance of the Medical segment through our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. The key driver to achieving our segment profit target of at least $650 million by fiscal 2025 is our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints. Though elevated inflation has persisted in the macro environment for longer than expected, we are on track to exit fiscal 2023 offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact on our business. As I previously mentioned, we plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal 2024. Our third wave of price increases went into effect on October 1, and we are planning additional actions for the third quarter. To-date, we have adjusted product categories representing nearly 90% of US Cardinal Health brand sales, excluding PPE. Additionally, we successfully adjusted language in product contracts as they've renewed to allow for greater pricing flexibility to respond to macroeconomic dynamics. We've also executed distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. Outside of our mitigation actions, we expect the largest contributor to our growth to be our ability to optimize and grow our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio. This will be achieved through new product innovation and increased product availability as a result of targeted investments. Additionally, I'm confident in our ability to optimize our cost structure and our sourcing and manufacturing footprints as we focus on driving simplification across the medical organization. The team is energized by the goals we have laid out in the medical improvement plan and has already hit the ground running on execution. Moving to item number two, for the Pharma business, continuing to build upon the growth and the resiliency that we've seen by executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily Specialty. Similarly, continuing on talent and leadership, we are excited by the appointment of Debbie Weitzman to CEO of the Pharma segment. Debbie has a deep understanding of our industry landscape, long-standing and strong relationships with our customers and a proven track record as a commercial and operations leader across her 17 years at Cardinal Health. Debbie's deployment was part of our recently announced segment restructuring designed to reduce complexity, drive productivity and efficiency gains, and simplify how our customers and our manufacturing partners to do business with us. These changes are intended to maximize the strength of our pharmaceutical distribution and Specialty businesses, bringing together similar services under one team, enabling us to respond faster and more effectively to changes in the healthcare landscape, while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Simply, it is allowing us to reposition with both the right talent and organizational design. In Specialty, we have a robust service offering, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and we continue to build upon our capabilities. In the area of oncology, we've expanded our best-in-class offering for value-based care, the Navista TS, which will continue to serve as a vital resource for oncologists transitioning to the new CMS enhancing oncology model. In rheumatology, we've closed on our recent tuck-in acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and our investment in our managed services organization has expanded our capabilities in the space and contributed to new customer growth. In just 30 days, this cross-functional leadership team worked diligently to onboard over 250 healthcare providers onto our distribution and logistics platforms. With biosimilars, we remain well positioned to distribute and provide the surrounding services as they come to market, particularly in the new therapeutic areas and sites of care. We continue to expect increased contributions from biosimilars in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Upstream and Specialty, our third-party logistics business continues its strong growth with more than double the launches in the first quarter compared to a year ago, as well as double-digit new contract wins. And our continued investment towards the digital transformation of our Sonexus access and patient support business has enabled us to realize benefits from new business wins and expansion of existing clients. And finally, number three, a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. This includes maximizing sustainable, profitable growth and cash flow generation, as well as a return of capital to shareholders. We continue to expect strong and resilient cash flow generation, supporting our capital allocation priorities. We are prioritizing organic growth, deploying CapEx to the highest value projects. We've made tremendous progress in reducing our long-term debt, which has created additional flexibility for shareholder returns. We were pleased to initiate the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter and continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal 2023, in addition to our ongoing dividend of over $500 million annually. Beyond these actions, we also announced enhancements to our governance structure, including four new independent Board members and a new business review committee, tasked with supporting a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. Our business review committee, which I chair, has already held multiple meetings and is working through the detailed review covering every business. We expect to share conclusions publicly at an Investor Day in the first half of calendar 2023. In closing, I recognize there is still a lot to accomplish, yet I remain excited about these opportunities to drive growth. I believe that our resilient business models, robust operating cash flow generation, favorable capital structure and capital allocation flexibility differentiates us in this time of macroeconomic uncertainty, and I am confident in our future. Before we open up to Q&A, I do want to spend a moment thanking our dedicated team around the globe. We've had a number of opportunities to connect with them across the last couple of months, and is truly a privilege to lead every day. They are driving the execution of the initiatives that we've discussed to date to deliver for our shareholders, for our customers and for their patients, and we are very much looking forward to the opportunities that remain ahead. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the sort of embedded expertise in the back half of the year. You obviously at the first quarter and you had some nice outperformance and hitting some early milestones and key initiatives. But in terms of like, how we think about that outperformance versus sort of how you still see the progression in terms of the quarterly ramp in the back half, more color on that would be very helpful? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. And as your question, Elizabeth, specific to any particular business, or are you just talking generally? Elizabeth Anderson : Specifically in terms of Medical, but I would also be curious on the Pharma side as well. Jason Hollar : Okay. Yeah. For Medical specifically, it's the biggest driver by far will be the mitigation actions to address inflation. That's \u2013 as we talked, our first pricing actions went in place March 1st, of fiscal 2022. And then we had another wave in July of fiscal \u2013 the very beginning of fiscal 2023, and then another price adjustment that occurred October 1. We do expect further price adjustments in the third quarter of the fiscal year. And then at the same time, we would expect, especially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to start to see some of the lower costs, especially with the international freight piece, finally starting to hit our P&L. As Trish highlighted in her comments, the supply chain remains very elongated. And so we would anticipate, it's going to take, again, at least a couple of quarters before lower costs actually come through the P&L. But as we indicated in our comments, the international freight is really the only area of any significance that we're seeing cost reductions at this point. We do see some of the other commodities coming down, but not to the same extent. The other key component from a first half, second half perspective for Medical is just the normalization of PPE. We talked about the higher-cost PPE being on our balance sheet when volumes fell quite a bit at the latter part of fiscal 2022, that meant that higher cost save in our balance sheet longer, and while we're pleased to see that it feels like we've come off the lows here from the fourth quarter in terms of demand, it remains still something that will take a few quarters to work through. And then beyond that, really for all of our businesses, it's just a normal cost reduction and other growth initiatives over the course of the year, just build up. Within Pharma, the specific item to remember from a first half, second half, specifically the third quarter is always just the recognition of the brand inflation. While that continues to be a small portion of our overall brand margin less than 5%. It does remain highly concentrated in the third quarter. And that's the biggest driver for that particular business. Next question, please. Operator : We will now take the next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : All right. Thanks very much. Jason, I want to spend a couple of minutes on the pharmaceutical distribution side of your business. So a few things. One of the things that really stuck out to me is you talked about strong performance in your generic program, and having enhancing programs going forward. I kind of think of where we need to be in generics. So maybe can you talk about what you're seeing in the market and incremental opportunities? And then secondly, when I look at the revenue on pharmaceutical distribution, you're coming in well above where the industry is. Can you maybe just talk about where you see that over time? And again, even your guidance is above where industry rates are? Like what's the key drivers there? Jason Hollar : Yes. Let me start with the revenue point. So revenue for -- this particular quarter we highlighted was driven by brand products as our -- with our larger customers. So when you think about the flow-through of that, that typically brings with it a lower margin profile, but brand has been very strong, and our larger customers have been an overweight of that. So kind of winning with the winners. We -- our bigger customers have been growing nicely, and that has been driving our revenue quite a bit higher, but that tends to be the lower margin product. And so, that's why you don't see quite the same flow-through in terms of margin dollars. That's fairly consistent to what we've seen for quite some time. We also highlighted in the third quarter fiscal 2022, some new business wins that did benefit our revenue as well. And with that, it means that the first half of fiscal 2023, we would anticipate our revenue having a little bit of a tailwind relative to the full year, because we will then anniversary lap that new business win come the third quarter of fiscal 2023. And so your first question -- I'm sorry, the first question on generics. Yes. So it continues to be a very consistent dynamics in the marketplace. Some of the new business wins have benefited that as well. We continue to have a very strong performance within Red Oak Sourcing. And the underlying utilization continues to be much more consistent and stable and predictable than what we've seen ever since the beginning of the pandemic. So it feels a little bit more as business as usual and less fluctuations and then underlying that, driving margin through sourcing and driving the new business through our system. So those are the primary drivers. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the contracting. I think the last time Cardinal went through a lot of contracting through COVID, it ended up kind of working against you, as things reverse. So I just want to understand more about how you're amending these contracts. Are customers comfortable with this? Is there any pushback? There seemingly is efforts on amongst almost all hospital companies to reduce their supply costs right now or reduce costs in general. So just wondering how it works? Does it -- is it impacting you immediately, or is this more of a cushion for longer term? Anything there would be helpful. And then one other follow-up. I read that there was a real estate transaction done, and now that was part of the business review potential outcomes was to maybe monetize some real estate. Can you talk about the opportunity size to be able to do that in terms of generating capital for the business? Jason Hollar : Sure. So on the contracting, first of all, Kevin, I'm presuming you're talking about the medical inflationary price impacts? Kevin Caliendo : Yeah. Jason Hollar : Yeah, okay. So the way the pricing that we've defined, those are temporary in nature to get us to the contracting that you're talking about. So as the contracts renew, those temporary price increases are then flowed through to the permanent structure with then having adjustments within there so that we don't have the same issue again in the future that we've had to experience here. So as you can imagine, those contracts roll over the course of multiple years, we've highlighted three to four years. And we're still in the earlier phases of an innings with that. However, I'll tell you, it's going consistent with my expectations. These are never easy conversations. But to your point and how you even frame the question, inflation is everywhere. And while some of this is more temporary in nature, a lot of it is going to be long-lasting and permanent. When you think about specialty labor, right, those costs are never going to come down and a lot of the transportation costs feel like it's going to be at very elevated levels for quite some time. So there's some components that will be more variable. But ultimately, the one thing that's clear to us is that, there will be a permanent step-up increase in that level of cost. And depending upon exactly how the Fed moves here and how macro economic factors roll into this. We need to be positioned so that we have a structure that allows us to claw this back by the time we exit fiscal 2024. So again, not easy, but it's a process that our customers understand that, we're in the middle of this supply chain, and that we have to have the assistance to be able to offset these costs. And you can just look at our public financial statements to understand that, we're not making anything in addition on this. We are still funding this gap and that's why we have this urgency on this issue and why it's our highest priority as a business. As it relates to the real estate transaction, we've had some small transactions. There's nothing material at all to call out. The \u2013 there's always evaluation. We do own some real estate. It is a component of one of those factors that we look at. At this point, it's too early to talk about any type of opportunity with that. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. And can you speak a little bit to the long-term strategy and what's feasible in terms of your opportunity to improve mix and increase your exposure to Specialty over time? And as we think about kind of specialty, can you also speak to the biosimilar opportunity and your near-term positioning to participate with like HUMIRA biosimilars as well as others? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Well, first and foremost, absolutely, I appreciate and understand the question. This is a key reason for our recent reorganization within the Pharma segment. We have structured the team to have specialty in PD altogether, reducing the complexity, driving not just productivity, but more importantly, simplifying how we go to market with both our customers as well as the manufacturing partners. So this is all to recognize the importance of driving that favorable mix. The market is going to, in part, be a rising tide but we definitely want to do as much as possible to participate as much of that growth as there is. We did just recently acquired Bendcare that gives us additional exposure here. We have invested organically in all the different businesses and tools that I referenced in my script. So we're investing both inorganically as well as organically and have now a structure and a leadership team that's intensely focused on this. So we feel like we're really well positioned to be able to take advantage of that into the future. On biosimilars, that is absolutely a component of this as well. The same point. We've invested into our capabilities and our team. We participate in that today. It is a nice driver for our business, not large enough that we have called it out specifically. But nonetheless, it is an area that, as we continue to see evolution of the sites of care in the therapeutic areas, then we would anticipate that to be further opportunities for us, and it fits nicely into our capabilities. I know we get a lot of questions specifically about Humira and how that is going to benefit us. There's a lot to be still played out here in terms of how all participants drive the different processes for this, specifically the payers and PBMs, how they go to market and work with the market to implement these evolutions. So a lot to be learned there. But the point is, we are positioned very well, we're able to take advantage of that. But there's some level of uncertainty, but we do have confidence there will be a tailwind for us going forward as it has been in the last few years as well. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael Cherny : Good morning. I have one kind of just technical question and then a bit more on the numbers. So just first, on the ASR, you said you launched it in mid-September. Is there any way to quantify how much of the ASR you completed in 1Q relative to the timing of the 2Q finish? And then, on the guidance, and I hear you on especially the trajectory of medical per Elizabeth's question earlier. But if you think about the moving pieces and what you updated today, it seems like there's more tailwinds when it comes to tax interest expense and share count than there are headwinds on the medical guide down. Any thought about why reiterating the guide versus not maybe bringing up the low end of the minimum? Jason Hollar : Sure. As it relates to the ASR, the -- your technical question. Yes, about 80% is what you would expect for the immediate benefit. And like you appropriately referenced, it was implemented in mid-September, so a relatively small impact to the current quarter. As it relates to the guidance changes, well, hey, it's the first quarter. It's certainly early. We're also talking about -- still a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're also talking about a lot of news out there that we're always looking at in addition to our own data in terms of utilization. So as our comments highlighted, we did not see a lot of surprises as it relates to utilization in either of our businesses, either our segments this particular quarter. And that was certainly welcome, given what the last couple of years have looked like. But nonetheless, we continue to see more data points on that through a lot of external references, and that's something that we continue to look at. But mathematically, I don't think there's that much difference in terms of the offsets that we took, both in the takedown with medical driven in part by that simplification efforts, but then also those other items where we took the top end down. It's still a reasonable range considering how early it is in the year as well as the drivers that are all around us. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thank you. I'd like to return to Medical and relative to the offset that you're attempting to achieve in 2023, it sounds like we have three factors, the pricing efforts, letting some of the supply chain and cost flow through or normalize and then access to private label. Could you speak to what portion of the offset for fiscal year 2023 falls into those buckets, if you think those are the right buckets? And then as you move to 2024, how does that change in terms of how much is driven by each of those factors? Jason Hollar : So just make sure I understand the question. So we have our gross inflationary impacts and then we have the mitigation actions that get us to the net. You're specifically asking about the mitigation actions, and how to think about what's driving those, both for 2023 and 2024? Eric Percher : Exactly. What are the most material factors of the mitigating actions and how do they change 2024 versus 2023? Jason Hollar : Yeah. By far, it's pricing. That is \u2013 there's opportunity. And of course, what we want to do is work with our customers as much as possible to reduce what is necessary to flow through in terms of pricing, but the amount that can be moved on those items as well as others is relatively small. So, pricing will be the predominant element there. The other component is just the cost coming down naturally as well. So we have two things happening between now and the end of the fiscal year. Pricing will continue to go up period-to-period, quarter-to-quarter. And our costs will, at some point here, peak, which we're pretty close to that. We believe we indicated similar gross costs in Q1 as what we expect in Q2, and especially into Q4 with the international freight piece, that's the one area that we have some confidence is going to come down. And so I know your question is specifically on the mitigation items, but the gross will come down is expected to come down right now, specifically because of the international freight. The other components to inflation and other commodities, especially, we are seeing them come down a little bit in some areas, but not very significantly, and certainly at a pace less than what we had thought. And a handful of them are actually going up. But overall, I would expect to exit the year, with a little bit lower cost run rate than what we have coming into the year. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Jason, I'm going to come back to the MedSurg segment again. I was just wondering if there's kind of a way to quantify like what part of the book has the new contracting terms in place? And I don't know if you can talk about kind of the actions taken by peers. And then kind of \u2013 I kind of roll that into kind of timing of implementation like you kind of talked about the two quarter lag between \u2013 not really the lag, but like kind of the timing of the supply chain in that segment of the book. So I'm just trying to think about how long it takes the entire book to get re-contracted into the new terms? And kind of what is the end date by which we should expect the full MedSurg book to kind of be operating under the new model? Jason Hollar : Well, it's going to take at least a few more years to get to, the essence where you're going with that to get the full book there. But it will be relatively consistent between now and then. So every \u2013 remember, these are not necessarily massive clip event contracts. Our product \u2013 we've got a couple of dozen different product lines, and they have different dates with different GPOs and different customers. So it's a fairly consistent stair stepping towards that. It's not like one big clip event. So you can think about it as every day, we have to work on this. And every day, it's incredibly important that we roll over the temporary prices into permanent prices given the permanent nature of so much of this cost. So we are considering different ways to give you a little bit more insight to that. I'm not going to go into that further yet, other than to say we are having the success as expected with this. We feel it's the right thing, and we feel very good about this plan, and there's still a lot of work we need to focus on, but it's the right plan. It's the right thing to do and we have not been surprised with this at this stage of the year and at this stage of the plan. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Hi. Good morning. I might just ask, obviously, you've got a lot of things going on and seemingly having some success with your simplification and mitigation strategies. Now you have this business review committee. Are the -- and that's -- I know it's still early in getting up and running and going. Are the guardrails as to the things you're already doing to improve performance versus what the business review committee is doing pretty clear? And did I hear you right in the prepared remarks that you think a review committee will have an update at the calendar 2023 Investor Day? I assume that would be preliminary if there's anything to share them. Jason Hollar : Sure. So, yes, there's a charter for the business review committee. It's very consistent to what I provided in my comments. Of course, there's a portfolio element. There's a strategy and operations element. And importantly, there's a capital allocation framework. As we communicated before, we had these types of evaluations and communication with our board prior. We now have new Board members. Of course, we have the business review committee as well. So it's a bit more of a formalized process. We are taking full advantage of the insights and experience that all of those board members are bringing to the discussion and the business review committee acts as any other Board committee, where we work and provide insights and advice to the broad Board and make it a bit more of a formal process. But the guardrails are, as I just described there and it's very clear what we work on. As I share it and I lead the agenda, I've, of course, also listened to the committee as to what they believe are the key areas of opportunity, and it's very collaborative and constructive. So from my perspective, we're getting good insight. I think that all of our Board members, but the committee specifically is doing the best we tend to think through the lens of the investor and make sure that we're driving the business, we're evaluating the portfolio. And, of course, we're in a fairly uncertain time, both operationally and from a macroeconomic perspective. We have that filter as well that comes through our work that we evaluate. But nonetheless, we -- as I commented already, we are meeting frequently. We are meeting with urgency, and we're very focused on this. As it relates to the readout, yes, you heard that right, the calendar 2023 -- by the first half of calendar 2023, we will have that Investor Day. And we'll have an update as to what is potential to update at that point in time. And I see this as a journey, not necessarily just a sprint, but we are working with urgency to have as much completed by them as possible. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two really here. Just a follow-up, on the Medical guide, I might have missed it, but \u2013 obviously, you've changed it. Was it \u2013 has there been any change in your assumptions in the macro environment between July and now that's \u2013 is it really macro driven is how \u2013 in fact, because it seems like you have control over the pricing part of things \u2013 is it just waiting for the environment itself and some of the natural inflation that's floating around here to come in line to get to your targets? And then secondly, there's been news a lot about shortages in amoxicillin. Just any of your thoughts here on truck shortages, elsewhere possibly in the supply chain, any thoughts on the outlook there? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. Yeah. In terms of Medical, it's \u2013 the underlying performance that we are anticipating for the business is really unchanged. The key item we highlighted is the simplification cost that has been wrapped into this. But the underlying business volume utilization, other performance elements are relatively unchanged. There's always puts and takes. Not a lot of new news there for really either business. In both businesses, we had a few non-recurring items, a little bit of timing in medical. But overall, not too many surprises there. As it relates to any type of product shortages, there's always some of that in any of our business. There's a few items that are being chased within the Pharma segment. Nothing that, I would call very unusual and certainly. Nothing at this stage that I would anticipate being a significant impact or really any noticeable impact for the segment for the current quarter or the fiscal year. But that's why we believe that, obviously, just sourcing in general is an incredibly important function, specifically to Generics, it's the Red Oak Sourcing is a huge driver for not just cost control, but for delivery. And certainly, there's been some strong demand for some of those products like amoxicillin that you just referenced for respiratory challenges that we're seeing some drive for in the marketplace. But again, it's something that we don't think will be either lasting or any type of impact for us. Next question, please. Operator : And our last question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So you guys touched on this topic a little bit, but this quarter, we saw your largest publicly traded hospital distribution and self-manufacturing MedSurg competitor really struggle with delayed product reorders by their acute care hospital customers who chose to deplete the stockpiled items. So I know you have a different set of SKUs versus that competitor for the self-manufacturing component. But can you just confirm that you generally are able to successfully track the level of inventory sitting within your health system customers in the Medical segment and currently, we hopefully not seeing a similar inventory destocking trend within the health system customer base that could be a risk factor for the recovery as the fiscal year progresses? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes. So those types of comments are very consistent with what we've been saying in the last couple of quarters. So we have seen destocking of our customers' inventory. We are very close with them and have that dialogue all the time and that is what we have been seeing. We referenced in our comments that our volume, specifically to PPE, but even more broadly is fairly consistent sequentially from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year. So we're not seeing significant changes in the poll, but we did call this out last quarter because it was a fairly significant reduction we saw sequentially at the latter end of fiscal 2022. So the concept we absolutely have referenced ourselves and have seen, but we have seen pretty consistent demand patterns here this last quarter. And while it's still very early in Q2, I can say that we haven't seen anything significantly different so far at the beginning of this quarter as well. But there's really nothing else to add at this point. So I think that's the final -- final question. So I'll just end it with just a couple of closing comments here. I'll end where I began my comments this morning that I am pleased with the progress that we're making in our core business fundamentals. We are driving lasting improvements in both segments while maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Aaron Alt to Cardinal Health as our incoming Chief Financial Officer. We're excited to have Aaron on board. He brings a breadth of financial and operational experience to our organization, including a background in distribution and he's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks. I'm confident he will be a valuable addition as the leader of our finance organization, contributor to our executive committee and a seamless fit with our company culture. Aaron Alt : Thank you, Jason. Good morning. I am excited to be part of the team here at Cardinal, particularly at such an important time not only for our company but for the entire health care industry. What attracted me to Cardinal Health was the broad portfolio, the overall culture and the leadership team that is motivated to win. While still early days for me, I can already tell that while there's work to do, Jason and the team have a plan and there are significant opportunities for value creation in front of us. I look forward to interacting with all of you further in the weeks and months to come as I continue to ramp up. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. Now let's begin with some high-level perspectives on the second quarter. Overall, our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum against our plans. In Pharma, we've seen ongoing stability in the macro trends and underlying fundamentals of the business. In the quarter, we saw particular strength in overall pharmaceutical demand and strong performance from our Generics program. We've seen an increase in contributions from Specialty products, which is a key strategic area of focus. And we continue to effectively manage through the inflationary headwinds affecting industry supply chains. In short, Q2 was another data point that Pharma is a resilient and growing business. In Medical, we remain highly focused on our medical improvement plan initiatives. Overall, despite some puts and takes, Medical's Q2 results were consistent with our prior commentary, and we were pleased to see a return to profitability in the quarter. We continue to take actions to drive more predictable financial performance, in line with this business' underlying potential. At an enterprise level, we continue to see benefits below the operating line from our capital deployment actions and favorable capital structure. With the first half of fiscal 2023 behind us, we are pleased to raise our full year EPS guidance and outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment. Our team remains focused on executing our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I will update you on these priorities in a few moments. Before I turn it over to Trish to review our results from the quarter and revised outlook, I'd like to thank her for stepping in as interim CFO over the past six months. Trish has brought leadership and continuity to the organization and will be instrumental in ensuring a seamless transition with Aaron. Thanks Trish. Trish English : Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with our consolidated second quarter results. Total company revenue increased 13% and gross margin increased 3%, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4%, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs. Benefits from our enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives offset some of this increase. Operating earnings of $467 million were in line with the second quarter of last year, this reflects growth in Pharma segment profit offset by the decline in Medical segment profit, which was anticipated. Moving below the line, interest and others decreased nearly 30% to $18 million driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our second quarter effective tax rate finished at 23%, approximately 3.5 percentage points higher than prior year, primarily due to net positive discrete items in the prior year period. Diluted weighted average shares were $263 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. In the second quarter, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and initiated a new $250 million program, resulting in a total of $1.25 billion deployed year-to-date. We continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2023, which reflects our continued focus on maximizing shareholder value. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share growth of 4% to $1.32. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $439 million, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $781 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.7 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. As a reminder, we continue to expect to pay down the $550 million of March 2023 notes at maturity with cash on hand. Now I will cover our segment performance, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 15% to $48 billion, driven by brand and Specialty Pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 9% to $464 million. This was driven by a higher contribution from Branded Specialty Products and Generics program performance, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we saw strong overall pharmaceutical demand, including from our largest customers, reflecting their strength in the market. To a lesser extent, we also saw year-over-year contributions from the net new customers that we've previously mentioned and a more robust seasonality with cough, cold and flu products as others have noted. Regarding our Generics program, we are pleased with the solid execution and consistent market dynamics we continue to see. This includes strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, not only controlling costs, but also in maximizing service delivery for our customers. Within our supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the industry-wide inflationary costs being in the areas of transportation and labor. In the second quarter, these inflationary impacts were generally consistent with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, this headwind was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from our complete ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs. Okay. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, including PPE pricing and volumes. Continued strong growth in our At-Home Solutions business partially offset this decline. Medical segment profit finished in line with our prior commentary, decreasing 66% to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and net inflationary impact, partially offset by an improvement in PPE margin. During the quarter, the net impact from inflation was in line with our expectations, and we achieved inflation mitigation of over 30%. This sequential improvement from the first quarter was driven by the continued acceleration of our mitigation efforts, including the implementation of additional product pricing actions in the quarter. On our last two earnings calls, we have discussed overall volume softness in our Products and Distribution business. In the second quarter, we saw generally consistent overall volumes on a sequential basis, including our Cardinal Health brand products. With respect to PPE, we did see some slight improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Additionally, we made significant progress in selling through our higher cost inventory on our balance sheet leading to normalized PPE margins in the quarter. Now for our updated fiscal 2023 outlook beginning on Slide 8. We are raising our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the lower end and $0.10 at the higher end to a new range of $5.20 to $5.50, which represents 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This update reflects improved outlooks for the Pharmaceutical segment and for interest in other. We now expect interest in other in the range of $115 million to $130 million with the improvement primarily driven by the increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on Slide 8 remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 9 in the Pharmaceutical segment. We are raising our outlook for revenue to a new range of 13% to 15% growth and for segment profit to a new range of 4% to 6.5% growth, both of which primarily reflect our strong first half performance. As we look to the second half in pharma, we anticipate the year-over-year profit growth to be fairly balanced between the third and fourth quarters. Turning to medical. We continue to expect a revenue decline of 3% to 6% and segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, we continue to expect a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2023 or a minimal year-over-year impact. On the cost side, while still at elevated levels, we\u2019ve seen a general stabilization across most areas along with improvement in international freight. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory and in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate two quarter delay. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation. And finally, no changes to the expected cadence of Medical segment profit. We continue to expect segment profit to improve sequentially and be particularly weighted toward the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around the net impact of inflation, and to a lesser extent, a gradual improvement in overall volumes and the continued implementation of our cost savings measures. For the enterprise, a key factor continues to be the overall utilization and demand environment. In pharma, we expect continued strength in overall pharmaceutical demand in the second half, albeit, at a more moderate rate than we\u2019ve seen to date. In medical, we expect a gradual improvement in overall volume, including with Cardinal Health Brand. Therefore, if the trends from the first half of the year continue, we would anticipate segment profit more towards the upper end of our range in the Pharma segment and more towards the lower end of our range in the Medical segment. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Trish. Let me now provide a few updates on our three key strategic priorities for fiscal 2023. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. Importantly, we remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. I am pleased with the incremental progress achieved in the second quarter as we mitigated over 30% of the growth impact to our business in Q2. Taking a step back, over the past nine months, we have made a series of widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories. We\u2019ve also executed supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency. We\u2019ll continue to monitor cost trends and work with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions. As we have taken a transparent approach working collaboratively with our partners, we continue to make progress on this front by successfully adjusting product contracts as they renew. We are also including language that allows for greater flexibility to respond to future macroeconomic dynamics. We continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation and to fully mitigate inflation by the end of fiscal 2024. Outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio. As Trish indicated, the market demand environment in medical has been relatively stagnant over the last couple quarters. Additionally, some of our higher margin Cardinal Health brand categories remain underpenetrated, which we are addressing through target investments to increase product availability, new product innovation and a continual focus on commercial excellence. For example, we recently expanded our sustainable technologies manufacturing facility in Riverview, Florida, doubling the size to roughly 100,000 square feet. This facility will enable us to better meet increasing demand for single use device collections, reprocessing and recycling services, supporting future growth, while also delivering supply resiliency, sustainable solutions and cost savings for customers. We\u2019re also investing to accelerate our growth businesses primarily at-home solutions where we\u2019ve seen strong growth fueled by the secular trend of care shifting into the home. Our new Central Ohio distribution center equipped with robotics and automation technology will be fully operational soon as we continue to expand our footprint to match the sustained growth of home healthcare we are seeing in the industry and our business. And in our higher margin Medical Services business, OptiFreight Logistics recently expanded its offerings with total view tracking, a new capability offering healthcare providers real-time shipment tracking to enhance supply chain visibility and resiliency. Second, moving to the Pharma segment where we\u2019re building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We\u2019re focused on executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily specialty. In the first couple months, we\u2019ve already seen efficiency and effectiveness gains from our recently combined pharmaceutical and specialty distribution organization. We\u2019ve seen strong growth across specialty distribution, including within acute health systems and alternate care. Additionally, our recent acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their managed services organization has been positively received by customers. Part of the recent segment organizational changes, we also created a new sourcing and manufacturer services organization, enabling a more holistic approach to enhance our strong pharmaceutical manufacturer partnerships. This includes strategic sourcing along with the high demand area of manufacturer services. In Q2, we saw double digit growth from manufacturer services where we continued to invest to build upon our capabilities such as our leading specialty 3PL and Sonexus, our access and patient support portal. And in the area of cell and gene therapy, we are excited about the work we are doing in this emerging space across all of our service offerings, expanding our capabilities and the opportunities we see in the future. We are investing in automation and enhancing technology across our supply chain today in order to drive operational productivity for the future. We\u2019re striving to deliver a flawless end-to-end customer experience supporting our strong and diverse customer base. For example, a recently announced collaboration with Palantir will offer customers a solution that connects diagnostic and clinical data with real-time purchasing and consumption data. By leveraging AI and machine learning, our customers will be empowered to make better purchasing and inventory management decisions for their businesses and patients. We are privileged to serve and partner with leaders across the various classes of trade, such as retail pharmacy chains, mail order and grocery, as well as retail independence, long-term care and health systems, all of whom provide essential healthcare access for their respective communities. And lastly, a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In addition to the shareholder value creation initiatives we\u2019ve already announced such as our governance enhancements and simplification actions, we continue to place a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Our Business Review Committee continues to work through the comprehensive review of our company\u2019s strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. We plan to hold an Investor Day in June 8th in New York City, where among other topics we\u2019ll provide an update on our company\u2019s long-term financial outlook, detail our growth strategies, and share any relevant conclusions from the ongoing review. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on our new ESG report, which was released just last week. This expanded report outlines the steps we\u2019re taking to operate in a more sustainable and equitable world through our established ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We continue to make progress against our long-term targets and are committed to regularly updating our stakeholders. We believe that we can simultaneously drive ESG improvements in support of our ongoing business transformation. In closing, while there remains work to do, I\u2019m encouraged by our team\u2019s progress to date and excited about the opportunities ahead. I want to thank our dedicated Cardinal Health employees for driving the execution of these critical priorities and who keep our customers and their patients at the center of everything they do. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill calling from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and thanks for all the details, Jason. Just on the medical side, one of the things that stuck out to me is you talked about the improvement and you talked about needing improvement in volumes. So as we think about that, can you maybe talk about your expectations around surgical procedures as we move into calendar 2023, the back half of the year? And secondly, has part of the issue on the hospital side been staffing issues? And as they start to resolve that, will things get better for Cardinal as well? Jason Hollar : Yes. Hi, Lisa. I think you\u2019re connecting all the right points there. That\u2019s what we hear from our customers and broadly from our peers in the industry, is that there continues to be some constraints as to getting to the free level of demand there. And we do think that\u2019s a component of what\u2019s impacting the lack of growth that we\u2019re seeing within medical. It\u2019s impossible to tell definitively, but that\u2019s the anecdotal feedback that we are hearing. To help provide a little bit of color around the impact and that\u2019s why we \u2013 Trish had made some comments within her commentary there highlighting that we do anticipate a gradual improvement over the course, so not significant, but getting back to closer to more normalized level of growth. As a reminder, when we provided our medical improvement plan, we highlighted a 3% CAGR total volume growth over the three year period and we anticipated that about half that would be market growth, about half that would be our own innovation and capacity expansion plans for our products. So you\u2019re talking about a couple percent type of growth that would be more normalized and that\u2019s kind of differentiator between our more of a midpoint of our guidance to what would be more in the lower end, and that\u2019s why Trish provided that type of clarity. Lisa Gill : So is the right way to think about that kind of half of it, Jason, you feel like you have some level of control because it\u2019s new products that you\u2019re bringing to the market, and the other half is you\u2019re going to have to wait to see if those volumes come back? Or do you feel like you really truly have visibility around the whole 3% that you\u2019re talking about? Jason Hollar : Yes. No, I think you have it generally right. Now remember that a lot of the part that we have control over is new product innovation and fast expansion. So that\u2019s always an element of the three year plan I would expect to be weighted a little bit more towards the later end because it takes time to school up those investments and getting those products into the market. So we didn\u2019t ever indicate it was a linear type of plan. And volumes, we have to be careful too that we\u2019ve had a period here last two to three years that\u2019s been incredibly choppy in terms of the volumes. Obviously down during the beginning of the pandemic and has come back for the most part. The last couple of quarters have been very predictable, very consistent types of volumes, but that\u2019s \u2013 even that\u2019s a bit of an anomaly from what we\u2019ve had over the last few years. So presuming that that maintains then that\u2019s the range that we should be thinking about. But if we get back to an increased level of volatility, which at this time we don\u2019t foresee but that\u2019s certainly a possibility as well. Lisa Gill : Okay, great. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit more about the pharma improvement in the back half of the year, specifically like as you\u2019ve had time to sort of think through the pharma reorganization and sort of continued cost cutting benefit is that\u2019s what\u2019s improving the operating profit growth. Are you starting to get pricing in certain places where you hadn\u2019t before? You can help us kind of understand that mix. And then secondly on the interest expense guide, it looks like the back half guide has a big sort of step up versus what you did in the first quarter \u2013 the first two quarters of the year in terms of interest expense. So is that just sort of changes in cash balance in terms of the net interest contribution or is there \u2013 are there other factors going on there? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes. I\u2019ll start with your second question there because you nailed it. It\u2019s really about cash balances. We don\u2019t anticipate there being significant differences in the interest size. Let me just kind of step back. We have a very fixed interest expense for our debts. So our interest expense side is quite predictable and known. It\u2019s really the interest income is the part that we\u2019ve seen favorability in year-to-date and our cash balances were higher than anticipated over the first half of the year. We do have the $550 million note coming due here in March that we anticipate to pay down and there\u2019s just a seasonal aspect of our cash flow as well. So we would not anticipate the same lower levels or I\u2019ll say improved interest income that reduces our interest expense in the second half, like what we saw in the first half. So you should take away that we continue to have a very advantaged balance sheet, especially as it relates to the fixed variables mix of our debt. As it relates to pharma, it\u2019s really more about volume than anything else. We\u2019re not seeing a lot of other key variables underlying the dynamics within the generic business continues to be very consistent. We continue to see very broad-based volume strength. Q2 was certainly very strong quarter as it relates to volume and we saw that broad base, I referenced in my comments between Trish and I, brand, specialty as well as generics. It is a lot of volume drivers within that. And as we think about the growth in the second half of the year, it\u2019s very consistent with what we had indicated at the beginning of the year. So our second half expectations remain consistent with what we had indicated before. A little bit less growth than what we\u2019ve seen in the first half. And that\u2019s just a reflection of, again, Trish\u2019s comments that we anticipated being closer to more normalized level of growth in the second half. But if we maintain the same level of strength that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters then there\u2019s some opportunity behind of that. And then just other \u2013 one other comment there about the Q2, why it was so strong. If you\u2019re thinking about it from a year-over-year perspective, we also just have the added points that we did introduce a new customer in the third quarter of last year. And that has been a nice tailwind for us the last four quarters. But this will be the last quarter until we start to lap that. So that\u2019s part of the driver from a year-over-year perspective. And then, not significant, but there is an element of cough, cold and flu. That\u2019s a nice little tailwind for the quarter. But at this point we don\u2019t anticipate that being a driver for the full year. In fact, this could be a little bit of a headwind as it relates to Q3 specifically because it looks like the season is ending earlier than normal. So those are all the key moving pieces. Elizabeth Anderson : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So just to parse through your numbers a little bit, I just wanted to get a sense. You\u2019ve had strong outperformance here to date based on typical timing, annualization and what you\u2019re calling for relative to growth rates. It seems like there\u2019s more opportunity for upside on your EPS. I know you talked about medical base list that you see now coming at the low end of the range. But can you give us some of the other potential concerns or headwinds that are built into this number? Just mathematically, you could argue that your EPS baseline should be higher and annualizing it, you\u2019d get there too. So I want to make sure I understand all of the \u2013 I guess, takes against the positive puts that you updated in your guidance. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks, Michael. First of all, overall I think it\u2019s a balanced outlook that we have. I think a couple of the key drivers in the first half, second half I just went through on Elizabeth\u2019s question. Interest expense is going to be higher. We expect to be higher in the second half. So that\u2019s one of the components you\u2019re thinking about from an EPS driver. And then pharma is a key driver as well, still solid growth in the middle of that range that we had at the beginning of the year. Not at the same pace of growth that we had in the first half, but still growth. And also just to kind of step back a little bit, and we had a similar level of growth, about 5% growth in the prior fiscal year. So now we\u2019re on 18 to 24 months, a pretty consistent, stable, much more predictable type of growth that we\u2019ve seen in that business as we\u2019ve step farther and farther away from the pandemic. And we think overall that\u2019s balanced. Of course, in the second half of the year there\u2019s a meaningful step up in the Medical segment performance, and that\u2019s of course being driven more than anything by the pricing on inflation and the first instance we would expect of cost stepping down as it relates to the international freight. But all the other drivers I think are fairly consistent with what we outlined. Question, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Erin Wright calling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Thanks. So you haven\u2019t really participated much in COVID treatment or vaccines, obviously with the contracts that are out there. But as those open up to the private market, could that provide an opportunity for you as we\u2019re looking into next year? And maybe thinking about some of those other anomalies kind of into next year, what are some things that you\u2019re thinking about in terms of opportunity across that core Pharma segment as well in terms of drivers? Or is it a continuation of the same in terms of specialty drivers in other ways? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. Thanks, Erin. Overall, first of all, as I think about fiscal 2023, it\u2019s a fairly normalized level performance that we have in our current outlook. Again, growth for the reasons I highlighted is a little bit stronger in the first half than what is in our longer-term targets. And we\u2019ve seen that very broad strength that I would not expect to continue long-term at that pace, especially when we consider that incremental new customer. The longer-term, I think what this year reinforces is that we\u2019re on track for those long-term growth targets. Specifically to your question around COVID therapies and vaccines, you have it \u2013 your inclination is correct. We\u2019ve participated very little on any of that. Over the pandemic, frankly, we\u2019ve had more of a headwind than a tailwind because the volume impacts on our underlying utilization. Of course, we\u2019re all the way through that at this point in time and have been so for about a year. So we\u2019re at a very normalized level at this stage. As it relates to commercialization, I think all data points point to that beginning in the summertime, of course, after our fiscal year, so certainly no impacts for 2023. There would be some opportunities for 2024 and beyond. However, I\u2019d highlight the types of products and vaccines we\u2019re talking about historically outside of the pandemic have not been significant drivers of profitability. So it\u2019s something that should be a tailwind, but I would not jump to the conclusion that it will be as significant as what we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace for others, given how the government had isolated that and procured for that. So something we\u2019ll keep an eye on and clearly something we\u2019ll be providing some context for further as we understand it better and as we get closer to the \u2013 that point in time. And the one final point on that is even though the commercialization is scheduled for the summer, there\u2019s certainly a lot of dialogue and uncertainty as to exactly how much a stockpile within the government and how long will it take for that to work through. So while it may go commercial, it could take us some time to actually see a pull in terms of non-governmental sources. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of George Hill calling from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. And I guess, Jason, my question\u2019s probably a derivative of Mike\u2019s question, which is kind of given the guidance for the year and the expectation to the back half, it would seem that the Street is probably too high. So I guess maybe could you talk about the big moving pieces just as it relates to the back half of the year? And should we think about the current guidance as probably a little bit on the conservative side? Or are there real areas of weakness, particularly in medical that we should be worried about in the back half of the year as it relates to where the company claims to deliver results, kind of versus where the Street is? Jason Hollar : Sure. I\u2019ll try George, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to sound very similar to what I said to Michael. Again, I feel good about the balance that we have here. I feel very good about the progress to date. We have growth \u2013 implied growth in the middle of the range for farming the second half of the year. So if volumes continue at a more recent pace, then we\u2019d have some opportunity. On medical, a lot has to occur still for us to execute upon our plan. It\u2019s very consistent with the plan. We have good step up expected to continue sequential improvements. This guidance provides us sequential improvement for each and every quarter throughout the year. We would anticipate the next quarter \u2013 next two quarters to have sequential improvements as it relates to the ongoing pricing for inflation, the ongoing cost reductions, a gradual improvement in volumes. But importantly the big step up will be in the fourth quarter as we see international freight, which is a very high confidence element now, given that we\u2019re now less than six months by the end of the year. These lower costs are almost certainly going to flow \u2013 start to flow through our P&L here in the fourth quarter, still at levels well below the pricing we\u2019re getting. But nonetheless, that\u2019s a pretty well-known part of that equation. So a lot of action still in front of us, but the plan remains entirely intact. And so when you talk about the first half \u2013 second half, you\u2019re implying there\u2019s some difference somewhere. And I think the primary difference is related to the growth within Pharma, still growing. And maybe one other point that remember, Q4 of last year for Pharma was a very strong quarter \u2013 we had very strong growth. It was a good quarter, and that's one that we still anticipate there being growth on top of that this year as well and that low to mid single-digit range. So we feel good about where we're at. There's opportunity in Pharma. There's some things we got to watch out on Medical, and we continue to execute all the below line items very consistent to our expectations. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrea Alfonso calling from UBS. Please go ahead. Andrea Alfonso : Thank you so much, Trish and Jason. Appreciate you taking the question. So just on the Med/Surg side, again, you've discussed the different tranches of price increases on the Med/Surg side that you're going to be taking with customers. I guess we just sort of love to get a qualitative update on GPO and customer receptivity in general. And should we expect, as we think about the cadence for the second half that, that would \u2013 those were more fully manifest in the numbers in 4Q? And again, sort of just as a corollary to that, you've highlighted some investments around private label. With the current constraints in the purchasing environment for hospitals, have you observed changes in just the general appetite here for private label? Thanks so much for the question. Jason Hollar : Terrific. Happy to do so. So on pricing, I would think about pricing as being a fairly stairstep process beginning back with our first temporary price increase in March 2022 so what we have \u2013 and when we first shared was the 20% mitigation of inflation soon after in the fourth quarter of last year, then that went to 25% in the first quarter of this year. And then now we're saying it's over 30%. So you can see that, that's a fairly consistent stairstep. And that's how I think about the pricing side, less on the temporary price increases going forward and more on the rotation to more renewals as they come up, and that's just a national function of where we're at in this process as we get farther away from the initiation of those temporary price adjustments. So a continuation of more of the same. How you get to a widening of that 30% to 50% by the end of the fiscal year is the costs starting to come down. So \u2013 and again, that's largely focused on the international freight. So pricing, I would expect to just continue blocking and tackling all the way through to the end of fiscal 2024 is where most of the prices will adjust. And that's why we indicate that we won't get to full mitigation until about that point in time. As it relates to private label, I think it's an interesting related question to pricing. Because yes, we want to work with our customers. All of our customers are dealing with challenges beyond the inflation in this category. They have actually much bigger challenges in other categories. And the desire on our part is to work with them if there's a possible win-win to find value in other ways, whether that is into more private label. It's \u2013 of course, we're doing everything we can to offset the increase \u2013 of the increases to start with to mitigate the inflation through other nonpricing means. And of course, part of this is also working with the supply base. And we indicated that we're working on the distribution fees as well so that the supply base does their part. We do our part and our customers are going to have to absorb this as well. So if the whole industry has to address this, and that's the collaborative approach that we're taking with it. Kevin Moran : Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee calling from Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just two real quick ones maybe on the model. First, Trish, I think you talked about Pharma distribution. We should think about the \u2013 it sounds like you're kind of saying the contribution should be kind of even through the back half of the fiscal year here. It's a little different than I think when you look back at normal seasonality, anything specific that you'd call out to why that might be this year? Jason Hollar : Yes, let me take that. So that comment was the growth rates were going to be even year-over-year. So you're exactly right, Charles, that there will continue to be the expectation of a normal seasonality. That largely comes from the brand inflation, albeit much lower than what it has been historically. We're still talking less than 5% contribution, but that is all in the third quarter. So sequentially, we would still expect the third quarter to have that element associated with it. Trish's comments were specifically related to the year-over-year growth rates being relatively equal between the two quarters. Charles Rhyee : I see. Okay. I might have misheard. And then maybe if I can just follow up on \u2013 you keep talking about the at home \u2013 I'm sorry, you keep talking about at-home solutions and how that's a good growth driver. In the past, you've kind of given a little bit of a breakout of the size of the business. Is there any kind of additional color you can give us here in terms of sizing of this business? How much it's grown relative to the rest of the segment? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes. You can also go to our segments. But note, this is one of the two businesses we, every quarter, provide incremental revenue information on. And that business, I think, last year was $2.4 billion of revenue. And I believe, for both the first and second quarter, we grew it by around 9%. But again, you can look at the segment footnote to get the precise numbers each and every quarter. Charles Rhyee : All right, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette calling from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So on Page 5 in the slide deck, you talked about \u201cjust generics program\u201d as one of the positive key variables. So I just wanted to get a little bit of color just to confirm kind of what you're referring to as the biggest component within that. When thinking about \u2013 are you just referring to just better generic volume and generate compliance rates with customers? Or is it just better buying through Red Oak. And also it's been really a much stronger new first-time generic launch calendar as well. But just curious, what's the biggest piece within your comment about just the generics program, thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes, overall, the biggest component for this particular quarter and most quarters that we've seen more recently has been volume. I continue to use the statement consistent market dynamics that's referencing essentially the margin per unit. Yes, there's ongoing deflation, but the buy-side sell side continues to be relatively in balance. And so when we see a year-over-year driver, it's driven often by volume and/or mix. And we continue to see very broad strength across all the products, whether it be generics, brands, specialty \u2013 and so this particular quarter, we saw that as well. Again, not the biggest driver. But when I talk about cough, cold and flu, a lot of those products have gone generic. They're more mature products, so they do tend to carry with it a little bit lower margin price points, things of that nature. But that would be a component as well. But again, I'm only highlighting that, given how many questions we get on the topic, not that as a significant driver. But overall, the short answer is volume and mix. Steven Valiquette : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Eric Percher calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Question on nuclear theranostics, can you remind us where your investments are targeted in 2023 and where and when do we see ROI on those investments? And then given the development around Alzheimer's treatments, what are you looking for relative to approval or policy change on testing that could lead to more significant step up in demand in that business? Jason Hollar : Sure. So the theranostics business launched sometime last six, nine months, and we are starting to see now more of that contribution over the last couple of quarters. So it's in the ramp up phase. So we are seeing positive returns already on those investments. This is a business, a business case. And the thing about the nuclear business that is both wonderful and also at times a little bit frustrating is that the business is a long-term business. It means that we have good visibility long-term, but also it means that we have to wait until we can get that benefit. Theranostics has been something we've been working on since, well before I arrived here in the organization three years ago, and it's one that we're now seeing the fruits of all those investments and efforts from that team. As it relates to the second part of your question, Eric, I get lots of questions around trying to link our business, our nuclear business to specific approval, specific other drugs and therapies and how we can attach that. I would say that the beauty of this business and the success of this business is that it's not directly linked to a very specific particular outcome. We have broad expertise capabilities, we are not dependent on any one particular area, and is that diversification and of which we're seeing with the theranostics expansion being even more accentuated because we get to work with so many more manufacturers and partners that it just creates a broad opportunity for us to grow across the spectrum. So our business case for continued growth, our goal of achieving \u2013 doubling as a profit in this business from fiscal 2021 to 2026 is predicated on a lot of singles and doubles, not triples and home runs by, by attaching to a blockbuster type of drug.  So beyond that, we don't talk about individual drugs, individual manufacturers or products. And so like I said, I just don't think that's the real draw for this business is the breadth that we have and the broad capabilities. Eric Percher : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Taji Phillips : Thank you. It\u2019s Taji on for Brian. So you mentioned expecting stabilization of supply chain headwinds, particularly in freight transportation. Can you just discuss any sense you might have around the cadence of that proven moving forward? Jason Hollar : I wish I had more clarity. I would say that it's a lot more stable than it has been over the last few years, and we have to break apart freight into the components. So within international freight that I believe was an anomaly that is unlikely to occur anytime soon, if ever again we need to be prepared for it. We have diversified our supply chain further as a result of the living through that. But where those costs are, they're still elevated in certain areas, right. The main China to North America channels are much, much lower, but there is now a lot of sourcing through other parts of Asia that are higher than historical levels, but nowhere near the peaks. So we're clearly seeing at least an 80% reduction of what those were at the peak. And certainly much closer to pre-pandemic levels. So as it relates to international freight, it's not my big worry at this point, and it's one that we have to continue to keep an eye on and manage. The more elevated remains the domestic transportation it's still \u2013 it's also down from its peak, especially as it relates to anything related to diesel fuel. So that's also off its peak, and we're seeing certain pockets of improvement, but it's still very elevated compared to pre-pandemic. And there, I have less confidence that it's going to materially reduce from here. There's a lot of inputs that go into transportation other than just diesel fuel. You have the equipment and the drivers all which are higher costs and they're not expected to come down any time soon. So I expect domestic transportation to be higher, longer, perhaps forever. And it's why we need to have permanent pricing is because that component. But on the international freight side, that is why we are not pushing for faster price increases right now is because we believe that will be coming down on our P&L this next quarter. And as we get through fiscal 2024, those two lines, the price line and the cost line will finally intersect and we can see that that will be fully mitigated. Question, please. Operator : Final question comes from the line of A.J. Rice calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Yes, thanks a lot. I know growing specialty has been a priority for the company and this management team to set out. And you've mentioned that again today that you're having progress there. I guess, can you just maybe tell us where you're seeing success in the specialty area and is the plan progressing about as expected as it was talked about over the last year or so? Or is that an area not performance for you, or how would you describe that? Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes, it's absolutely meeting our expectations. It was a call out in terms of the broad volume that we had this last quarter. So we had strength across a number of many different categories and customers. We also called out double-digit growth within our sourcing and manufacturer services group which is a key component of the upstream elements of specialty. So the business is strong, it's large, it's growing nicely. We have \u2013 I think like the rest of the industry, biosimilars is a nice tail one that we're seeing, not large enough to call out as an individual driver. Our 3PL business, especially with the regulatory approvals being a little bit more normalized is well positioned. And we're continuing to invest in areas that will be growth opportunities in the future, whether that\u2019d be cell and gene or just where value-based care is going. We have our Navista TS platform, so we're investing organically. And of course, within our inorganic, we've had a nice success with our Bendcare GPO and the investment in the MSO that I think has given us some additional opportunities to think about in the future as well. So not any 1 item to highlight, but there is strong breadth across many different pillars of the specialty business that we feel good is a very strong foundation and platform for future growth. I believe that was our last question. Yes. Thank you. And I'll... Operator : Yes, there are no further questions. So I will hand you back to host to conclude today's conference. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just to summarize real quick. I'm pleased with the continued stability in Pharma, as we just discussed here today. As well as the progress that we're making in the medical business. We are committed to executing on our key priorities, including maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. So with that, thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect. Hosts, please stay connected on the line.",

I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded, and for the duration of the call, your lines will be in a listen-only mode. However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to hand the call over to your host today. Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Moran : Good morning. Today we will discuss Cardinal Health's third quarter fiscal 2023 results, along with updates to our full year outlook. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Jason Hollar, our Chief Executive Officer; and Aaron Alt, our Chief Financial Officer. During the call we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask to limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're pleased to deliver another quarter demonstrating progress against our plans with our Q3 results led by continued momentum and growth in the Pharma segment. With a strong overall performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal '23 EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance. Our Pharma business is a resilient and growing business where we're well positioned given our critical role in the pharmaceutical supply chain and strong and diverse customer base. We've seen ongoing stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business, including consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We've also seen continued broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories and classes of trade. Pharma team is executing our plans to build upon this growth, both in our core distribution operations and in Specialty, where we're focused on capturing the increasing demand for Specialty Products and Services. In short, we're pleased with the resiliency and strength of the business and to be able to raise our Pharma outlook for fiscal '23. Medical, we remain confident in our medical improvement plan target of at least $650 million of segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by our inflation mitigation and growth initiatives. While we are making progress with the second consecutive quarter of positive segment profit, we remain focused on taking actions to drive more predictable financial performance in line with this business's underlying potential. For several quarters now, we've seen demand for our higher margin Cardinal Health brand products remain generally stagnant, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal '23 outlook. We continue to achieve progress with inflation mitigation, the number one key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. Across the enterprise, we are operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward. We're collectively focused on our three key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment, and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I'll provide some further updates on our continued progress shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated outlook. Aaron Alt : Thank you, Jason. I am pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role with nearly 90 days now under my belt. What I could see from the outside has proven to be true on the inside. Cardinal Health is a business with a strong leadership team and engaged board, a defined strategy, a strong balance sheet and plenty of operational opportunities to promote value creation for our stakeholders. I'll begin today with the enterprise's strong results for the third quarter. Total revenue increased 13% to $50.5 billion and gross margin increased 6% to $1.8 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, which were offset in part by our comprehensive enterprise wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings of $606 million were 11% higher than the third quarter of last year, driven by significant Pharma segment profit growth with opportunities remaining for us to achieve Medical segment profit increases in future quarters. Moving below the line interest and other decreased 32% to $28 million, driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our third quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.4%, slightly lower than we had expected, reflecting some positive discrete items in the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares were 258 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to continued share repurchase actions. The net result of the progress against our strategy was adjusted earnings per share of $1.74 in the third quarter growth of 20% versus the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity with $4 billion of cash on hand. The business generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $2.1 billion. Given our cash balances, we ended the period with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. And in further support of our strong investment grade rating, during the quarter, we paid down $550 million of maturing March 2023 notes with cash on hand consistent with our plans. We also extended our $2 billion revolver of backup liquidity until February of 2028. Earlier in my remarks, I referenced return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $378 million to shareholders through a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program and payment of our long standing dividend. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.5 billion through share repurchase and made nearly $400 million in dividend payments. Now I will cover our segment performance beginning with Pharma on slide five. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $47 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong, broad based pharmaceutical demand, particularly from our largest customers. GLP1 medications also provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 23% to $600 million. We were pleased to see that this progress was driven by both positive generic program results, including volume and mix, and by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products. Within our generics program, we continue to see consistent market dynamics and strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing. With regards to branded and specialty products, the higher contribution reflects a modest benefit from manufacturer price increases. As a reminder, while over 95% of our overall branded margin is derived from fixed fee-for-service agreements, the contingent portion is highly concentrated in our fiscal third quarter. Moving to the key growth area of Specialty. We've seen strong double-digit growth across specialty distribution along with our upstream manufacturer services. Our nuclear business, which is tracking ahead of plan, continued its double-digit growth, including benefiting from recent launches of Novel Theranostics. Within our pharmaceutical supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the incremental inflationary cost pressures seen industry wide. And in the third quarter, these net impacts were not material on a year-over-year basis. Finally, in the quarter, we lapped more significant opioid related legal costs and higher costs related to the now completed ERP technology enhancements. Now turning to Medical on slide six. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to expected PPE volume and price declines. Medical segment profit decreased 66% versus prior year to $20 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix. Additionally, these results reflect both net unfavorable non-recurring adjustments, including simplification actions and some modest year-over-year improvements in PPE margins. Similar to Q2, we observed normalized PPE margins in the third quarter. Regarding the demand environment, we've previously discussed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including Cardinal Health brand. In the quarter, volumes for our Cardinal Health brand products were roughly flat sequentially. We achieved inflation mitigation of over 40% during the quarter, driven by our continued efforts. We also saw benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives such as in our manufacturing and supply chain. Now for our updated fiscal '23 outlook beginning on slide eight. Our team is working hard and we are seeing positive results in key parts of our portfolio. As we move into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $5.20 to $5.50 to a new range of $5.60 to $5.80. At the midpoint, this represents a $0.35 cent increase and 13% year-over-year growth. This update primarily reflects an improved outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment for the year, as well as a more modest short-term outlook for Medical. While we will save commentary or updates on long-term segment guidance for our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th, we are sharing today that we are reaffirming the long-term financial guidance in the medical improvement plan for the Medical segment. We are also updating some key enterprise wide assumptions as seen on slide eight. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect interest and other in the range of $95 million to $105 million, a non-GAAP ETR of approximately 22% to 23% for the year and adjusted free cash flow generation of $2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 262 million to 263 million, reflecting our year-to-date repurchase activity and continued expectation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '23. Finally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 million, reflecting the timing of our continued investment to drive organic growth. Turning to the segments on slide nine. In Pharma, with a strong pharmaceutical demand and performance that we've seen to date, we now expect full year revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15% and segment profit growth between 10.5% to 12% growth. We are extremely pleased with the ongoing resiliency and strength of the business and our plans to drive double-digit profit growth in fiscal year '23. Yet when looking at the more normalized performance of the Pharma business, it's important to note our fiscal '23 outlook includes two non-recurring year-over-year tailwinds. First, as noted, we experienced a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases in fiscal year '23 that we assume is unlikely to repeat in future years. Additionally, relative to the prior year comparisons, our previous fiscal year '23 guidance assumed offsetting year-over-year impacts in total between several non-recurring drivers, higher than usual inflationary supply chain costs, lower opioid related legal costs and lower costs for technology enhancements compared to fiscal year '22. However, we now expect the in-year comparison to fiscal year '22 for these items to produce a modest year-over-year tailwind unique to fiscal year '23. We will provide insights into our long-term targets for Pharma during our Investor Day, including some early guidance for fiscal year '24. Turning to Medical, we now expect a revenue decline of approximately 6% and a segment profit decline of approximately 50% for the year. This updated outlook reflects three key changes. First, third quarter actual results, as I've already discussed. Second, updated assumptions around Cardinal Health brand volumes, namely that we will see relatively consistent demand patterns for the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, delayed realization of lower costs, which we have previously incurred primarily related to international freight. Based on our updated volume expectations, we now expect some of the previously anticipated fourth quarter improvements in the P&L to shift into fiscal '24. As a reminder, on the cost side, we've seen significant improvement in incurred international freight costs, which are capitalized into inventory on our balance sheet. These costs are then recognized in our P&L results on a delay as we sell through the products. We continue to have strong line of sight into this eventual benefit. However, due to timing, the impact to our fourth quarter results will be more modest than previously assumed. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year, offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the approximate $60 million sequential improvement in Medical segment profit embedded in our guidance primarily reflects the combination of three items. First, the normalization from the non-recurring adjustments from Q3. Second, continued improvement in progress on our mitigation initiatives, including the benefit from the previously incurred international freight costs. Third, and to a lesser extent, normal seasonality improvements in the fourth quarter. So in financial summary, an excellent financial quarter overall, our raise to guidance with opportunities still in front of us. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. Now a few key updates on our three strategic priorities for fiscal '23. First, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. We remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, and I'm pleased with our continued incremental progress on this critical front. We've now mitigated over 40% of the gross impact to our business through our mitigation initiatives. This includes widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories, supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs, and our focus on other offset opportunities such as additional sourcing efficiencies. We continue to work collaboratively with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions on our path to fully mitigating this headwind by the time we exit fiscal '24 through these collective actions. By taking a transparent approach, we are also advancing our re-contracting efforts, successfully adjusting long-term product contracts as they renew, and including language that allows for greater future flexibility. While costs generally remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a stabilization across most areas, along with improvement in international freight. We believe we are now past peak overall cost levels as the improved international freight costs will begin to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. We remain committed to our mitigation efforts, as highlighted earlier. To drive growth outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, accelerating our growth businesses and driving simplification and continued cost optimization. As Aaron indicated, demand for our Cardinal Health brand products has remained generally stagnant over the first three quarters of fiscal '23. We believe market demand will improve in fiscal '24 and '25 coinciding with our ongoing initiatives to increase product availability, drive new product innovation and implement other commercial improvements. As an example of product innovation, we recently unveiled the new Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding platform at the ESPEN Congress. OMNI is the only enteral pump cleared to accurately deliver thick formula and is designed to meet enteral feeding needs from the hospital to home, infancy to end of life. OMNI has received very positive feedback from both clinicians and patients, generating excitement for the launch in early fiscal '24. Outside of US product and distribution, we're driving growth in other key areas of the segment. at-Home Solutions, Medical Services, including OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark and international products and distribution. For example, in at-Home Solutions, we are expanding our footprint to match the sustained growth of home health care we are seeing in the industry and our business. Our new Central Ohio distribution center is now operational. This new location is the next step in supporting our growth strategy and will be equipped with systems and automation capabilities to improve safety, service and operational efficiencies. A new audited storage and retrieval system will increase throughput and capacity. An ideal technology for at-Home Solutions facilities that are primarily focused on direct-to-patient fulfillment. In OptiFreight Logistics, we are accelerating our growth as a leader in tech-enabled logistics management by driving best-in-class customer experience and continually diversifying our product offerings. And we continue to take action to drive simplification across our Medical business by optimizing our distribution and global supply chain network and through our active approach to product life cycle management. Next, in Pharma, we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We are privileged to serve and partner with a broad customer base, providing essential health care services in their respective communities, including leaders in retail pharmacy, mail order, grocery and health systems among the many classes of trade. We support our customers by bringing significant scale and leading offerings to market, including our comprehensive generics program anchored by the capabilities of Red Oak Sourcing. To keep pace with the strong and resilient demand we are seeing from our customers, we continue to focus on strengthening our core operations by continually developing customer focused solutions and investing in new technologies across our supply chain. Our goal is to continue providing innovative tools that address the unique challenges of our customers while unlocking value and further efficiencies across our distribution supply chain. We're also prioritizing the area of specialty through our actions and investments. Our new organizational design is driving efficiencies and further effectiveness, enabling us to move quicker and better prioritize the needs of our customers and manufacturer partners. Downstream, we've seen continued double-digit growth across specialty distribution, including in health systems and alternative care. And in the physician office channel, our acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their MSO continues to drive a differentiated engagement model for rheumatologists through our expanded capabilities. Upstream with biopharma manufacturers. We again saw double-digit growth for manufacturer services in the third quarter. Our leading specialty 3PL continues to win new business, including in the area of cell and gene therapy. Through Q3, we supported 27 product launches with double-digit launches anticipated in the fourth quarter. And in our nuclear business, we're seeing a growing demand pipeline for our Center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis. We've seen strong volumes from recent Theranostics launches, such as radiopharmaceutical supporting prostate-specific PET imaging. With the continued success of the business, combined with the innovation that's occurring in the space, we continue to be excited about this very promising area. And lastly a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. We have placed a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders. This is evident through our plans to return over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23 through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pursue opportunities for additional shareholder value creation. Our management team has made significant progress in realigning our operations to drive focus and simplicity. Our work is ongoing and we continue to work through a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations with the support of our Board and the business review committee. Given the importance of this work today, we announced that the Board has extended the term of the committee for an additional year through July 15, 2024, and we have also extended the term of the cooperation agreement with Elliot. We are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day on June 8th in New York City and the opportunity to further articulate why we believe Cardinal Health is well positioned for long-term success and our plans to maximize shareholder value. Among other topics, we plan to detail our growth strategies and provide updates on our long-term outlook, capital allocation framework and the ongoing business and portfolio review. Before I conclude, I want to thank our Cardinal Health employees who are advancing our key strategic priorities and fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. While there's still work to do, I am encouraged by our team's continued progress and excited about our future opportunities. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Michael Cherny coming from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can just dig in on the Medical side and just get an understanding, especially given the bridge dynamics between where you're run rating versus the build to the $650 million in '25. Is there any way you can go into more detail about what the quantitative and qualitative components of what led to the nonrecurring piece that's been absorbed within the segment? And then as you think about the dynamics behind that, how does that roll off over time as part of that build towards the longer-term multiyear targets? Jason Hollar : Sure. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Let's break down the inflation into the components as a way of giving you the pieces I think you're asking for there. And we've given you enough of this, you can back into these numbers, but let me just be really explicit around the impact of inflation across the quarters in fiscal '23 and what that then implies for '24 and beyond. And I think that will get at most of your questions. So the first half of the year, namely within Q2, somewhere around Q1, Q2, we saw the peak net impact of inflation, gross inflation net of the mitigation actions. And then specifically in Q2, we had about $100 million included in our reported Medical segment earnings. Now we have had improvements over the course of the last quarter. So in Q3, we saw both the ongoing pricing dynamics as expected and the costs continue to be incurred at lower levels as expected. And what that did then was drove a P&L benefit related to those mitigation actions of $20 million to $30 million for the quarter. The difference in the quarter is that both Q3 as well as Q4, our volumes are now expected to be lower. So what we see in the P&L is a little bit less than what we had anticipated. But what we're spending on those incurred costs are coming in as expected. So again, that's Q2 to Q3, a $20 million to $30 million improvement in the net impact. And then we expect pricing to continue to improve as we roll over more and more contracts into the new permit structure. And then we have ongoing the international freight especially continue to roll through our P&L, again, at a slower pace than originally anticipated, but we still expect that benefit in the fourth quarter, and that's another $20 million to $30 million. So as you think about that Q2 to Q4 journey, that's $40 million to $60 million or let's call it about $50 million of benefit just related to the mitigation actions. So again, the actions are entirely consistent with our expectations. It's just that volume component is effectively delaying the benefit of what we see until some of it spilling over into fiscal '24 more than what we had anticipated. So that's the biggest part of the bridge because our guidance implies an $80 million-ish type of run rate in the fourth quarter. And so getting that Q2 to Q4, $50 million of that, that kind of gets you there. Now to your point, in Q3, there were some nonrecurring items, some puts and takes that we don't anticipate will continue on into Q4, let alone 2024 and 2025. So that's kind of in and out and not really something to think about so much in terms of that overall bridge. Now the last part of this story then is, okay, so that gets you to the run rate of about $80 million in the fourth quarter. And as I said, we started with $100 million at the beginning of the year, Q2 impacted because of inflation. The $20 million to $30 million each quarter takes you down to the $50 million in Q4. That implies that in that $80 million of profit as we exit the year in our Q4 results, still includes $50 million for the quarter related to the net impact of inflation. That's the opportunity that we remain committed to. Nothing we're talking about here is different than our expectations. I continue to expect us to fully mitigate through pricing of the ongoing renewals as well as this cost will continue to come down in terms of what impacts our P&L. We do not anticipate significant further reductions in other commodity areas, but we do expect that international freight will stay at the low levels that it currently is at. Next question please. Operator : Thank you, sir. Next question is coming from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and thanks for all the detail. Jason, I know you're going to talk about this at your Analyst Day around the portfolio review. But there's been some speculation around your nuclear business. Can you just talk about the contribution that, that had maybe overall thus far this year and how you see that? Is that a core component of your business going forward? Or is this something that you would think about when you think about your portfolio review? And any insights you have around nuclear would be helpful? Jason Hollar : As you would expect, Lisa. First of all, good morning. I'm not going to comment on the any of the rumors or speculation. What I'll say is nuclear is a fantastic business. In our segment footnote, we break out the revenue that's trending a little above $1 billion. It did increase a bit here because of some RevRec changes that's taking our revenue growth at well over 30%. But the kind of the normalized level of revenue growth has been in the low double-digit type of revenue growth. So it's been growing nicely. We've never broken out the margin, but we have indicated it's a higher than average margin. So it's a growing business. It's a strong business and a great secular area. And that's all that we're going to say about that. Next question please. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. We'll now go to Kevin Caliendo calling from UBS. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I want to -- I appreciate all the color around the things that you can control on the Medical side. But it's a little confusing to understand why market demand has been stagnant the last couple of quarters for your products. Given what we hear from at least the public hospitals and the like who clearly are doing better, is there a geographic issue? Is it a customer issue that you're not seeing increased demand? Is purchasing changing at the hospital level? Just -- or is it a product portfolio issue? Like what's actually happening in the marketplace that's kind of kept your private portfolio stagnant? Jason Hollar : Yes. There's a few components I can provide some additional color on. First of all, we've highlighted the some of the categories. So PPE, we've highlighted the destocking situation still. So we're not seeing anything new or different there. We have some other categories like our lab business, which is actually seeing a little bit of a headwind sequentially. Nothing too significant, but it's certainly with COVID originally and then with flu testing, we had some pretty good volume over the last couple of years, and that's getting more normalized. So we have some headwinds like that. For the other non-PPE type of Cardinal Health brand categories that are important to us, especially from a margin perspective, what we have to go back to is just highlight that a couple of years ago, last year, we saw some very significant supply chain constraints. And at that time, we were not able to get our customers the products that they needed. Fortunately, we've been working very hard on that. Our product availability, our product health, our customer service levels are at levels we've not seen since before the pandemic. So we're in really, really good shape now, but we were not getting all the products to our customers that they needed over that period of time. And we lost some opportunity as a result of that. So that's why we're not benefiting from as much of the growth right now. I do think that the underlying utilization is improving. We're not getting our fair share of that. And that's where we're very focused on further investments in our capacity, further investments and product innovation, but also just making certain that we keep our service levels ever increasing to levels that are really exciting our customers, so that they want to buy more and more of that product from us. And we're in the best position we've been in, in years and have more confidence that we'll get there. This is an important part of the medical improvement plan, right? It's one of the four pillars of growth. And so we are anticipating further improvements. It is about 20% of the actions necessary for us to hit the $50 million-plus target. That's why we're very focused on the other actions as well to see if we can over deliver and derisk this. But we do believe that utilization will continue to improve overall for the market, and we are better positioned now than we've been in a long time to participate in that, and I feel good about our prospects to see that growth, especially as we get into fiscal '24. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is coming from Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. One, I was hoping, thanks for all the details on the Medical business. I was wondering if you could just help us on one more thing and sort of exclusively tell us what the contribution of -- or the hit from onetime items was in the quarter on Medical? And then two, can you talk about the pushes and pulls on the Pharma operating profit in the fourth quarter? Because it seems like it could be a little bit of a bit conservative there. So I just want to make sure that we have all the dynamics down there. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Okay. So I'll make a comment on your first part of your question, I'll turn it over to Aaron for the second one. It's nothing that we've explicitly quantified just wanted to highlight the words that we used, again, that it was a modest net negative impact in Q3. So it's one component. It's a number of puts and takes within there. I did highlight that as an example, one of the types of items are some costs for further simplification actions. We had some of that in the first quarter as well. So we're constantly looking at our portfolio and taking action to improve our ongoing profitability and that required us to take some further adjustments within the quarter, but nothing else to really highlight there other than the key is that we just don't expect them to continue, certainly not the long-term or even into the rest of our guidance for fiscal '24. Aaron? Aaron Alt : Good morning. Happy to talk about the Pharma business. First, just let me repeat a little bit of what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we are really pleased with the performance of the Pharma business and what the team is accomplishing in that core part of our business the resiliency and the strength that they showed in Q3 based on the progress on the generics platform as well as some strength in the brand portfolio and the double-digit growth in specialty allowed us to be able to lean forward and raise our guidance for the year for the Pharma business. I want to highlight a couple of things as you think about Q4, which I think was the point of your question, which is, while we expect to see continued good news relative to the operational performance and a stable macro environment, with the strong underlying fundamentals we laid out, it is important to note that Q4 last year was a strong quarter for us, and so we're lapping a higher point. It's also the case that we'll have less benefit from some nonrecurring items that we called out in our prepared remarks earlier as well. And so overall, strong performance in Q3, looking forward to a good Q4. But careful in our expectation setting. Operator : Thanks very much, sir. We'll now move to Eric Percher of Nephron. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. Staying on the Pharma side, I wanted to ask whether the changes we're seeing to list prices around the insulin products and the potential for more changes in front of the AMP Cap Sunset next year is significant. I understand this is a change to fee-for-service economics, and that gives you a right to renegotiate. But how would you characterize renegotiations that type when they come up? And are you confident you can maintain absolute profit or something close to it? Jason Hollar : Yes. In short, very confident that we'll continue to appropriately be compensated for our activity-based value. So this is not any different than the various other types of adjustments we've had to make over the years, and it's something that I think we've demonstrated makes sense to make the appropriate adjustments. The other thing I'd highlight is the starting point for a product like this is not real strong margins to start with. So there's not a big profit pool from which to draw value from. So we do expect to be compensated for the value that we provide and we'll continue to monitor and follow. One thing we had talked about in the past on this type of topic is where I have the most concern is when we don't have sufficient visibility to changes and that something would just kind of fall in our lab at the last minute because it does require some renegotiation, restructuring in some cases of how the arrangements are made. This one is a little bit more straightforward, and we feel like we can negotiate the appropriate outcome for it. And we certainly have the time for it. But the distinction is if there's ever any really short-term type of impact, and that would be needed to be addressed separately. Operator : Thanks very much, sir. Next question is coming from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, first, as it relates to the Cardinal Health branded products in Medical, I guess, Jason, is there any way to evaluate whether or not you guys are losing wallet share with customers and that guy is impacting volumes? And I guess my quick follow-up on that would be as we know that you guys have historically look forward bought commodity-based products. I guess is there any way to provide any more color around the timing of when Medical in flex as it relates to kind of the forward buying and the commodity impact in the inflation mitigation. Just trying to think about when we kind of like when we see the inflation as it relates to these lower costs really pulling through. Jason Hollar : Yes. So as it relates to share I think when you look back at our volume, we had a step down in volume in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And again that was -- there was a lot of PPE that came out there. We clearly lost share there. It is a business that's a commodity business for us. It's important for our customers. We participate as needed. We source most of that product. So it's a category that's not our priority. What's most important is that we take care of our customer needs. In the non-Cardinal volume, and we also saw some weakness there, as I mentioned before, the supply chain constraints. So as other providers had capacity then we would have had a lower share as a result of that. Again I think there's been very little of that change since then. Our service levels and our product health have improved dramatically even over the course of fiscal '23. So I do not believe that we have everything that we're seeing from a new contracting perspective has been consistent with our expectations here this year. So I don't see anything new there. But we are dealing with some impacts that happened over the last couple of years. That part is the case. Your second question, I think, I answered it before in terms of the timing associated with the commodity impact is really the international freight is the big one that's reduced. And that reduced significantly six to nine months ago. And that's why right now, we're on the cusp of having to hit our P&L favorably or benefit our P&L is because we typically have two to three quarters' worth of inventory. Why it's spilling over into '24 is that our volumes have been lower than anticipated. And so it's taking a little bit longer for us to recognize that benefit. I've not called out any significant movements on other commodities. There's clearly movement. There's some better. There's some that have not improved. Overall, it's consistent with our expectations. We expected a little bit of an improvement across the board, and we just haven't seen anything more than that outside of international freight. We do have some categories that are just staying very high like nonwovens, where there's a bit of a geopolitical impact on those types of costs and not just on raw input costs. And so that is something that may or may not change in the future. It's why we have to have the right structure in the contract, if there's a further shock to be able to have more flexibility with our price adjustments. But overall, we're seeing the other commodities continue to be pretty stable, admittedly at fairly high levels, but they're not changing enough to really impact our overall message here. And by the way, as those change, our pricing will change. Our objective is to offset this. We're not expecting to make a margin on this. But if those come down more quickly, then at some point, I would imagine that those costs will adjust -- those prices will adjust consistent with that. But right now, we are still absorbing $50 million, well, $50 million to $75 million right now per quarter of those costs, and that's why our prices do need to still keep increasing until those two lines converge, which we think will be, again, closer to the end of fiscal '24. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Next question is coming from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Eric Coldwell : Thank you. Most of mine have been covered, but I did want to hit on the generics pricing topic. I know you've made some positive comments during the call, but also suggested that market dynamics are generally consistent. We've seen some generic pricing in our data, some generic pricing deflation improvement over the last few months. I'm curious if you're seeing the same thing. And what your outlook might be on that front moving forward? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Eric. We called out favorable volume and mix and consistent market dynamics. As we've highlighted many times before, it's important to look at the total of both sides, buy and sell. And we continue to think those overall dynamics are fairly well balanced. And there will be ongoing volatility on one direction or the other, one side or the other, but it's the importance of Red Oak Sourcing and continue to deliver the best-in-class service levels as well as cost. And we feel very good about our competitive positioning there and why we think the margin per unit will continue to be as expected and not as much a part of the story than as the volume in the mix. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Next question is going to come from Mr. Steven Valiquette calling from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. You might have just touched on this a little bit, but I guess I was curious more just for the overall Pharma segment. You've had obviously a bunch of consecutive quarters now of double-digit top line growth, including 14% this quarter. And you talked about brand inflation, brand volume, generic specialty, all being strong. So I guess my question was related to. Operator : Very sorry about that gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Jason Hollar : Well, if I could, I think I might know where he's going with the question. I think he was leading up to -- I'm guessing that he's leading up to, were there any deviations from that. I mean what we saw was really broad-based performance throughout our Pharma segment. I meant -- I've asked -- answered questions about nuclear, nuclear was just like our other businesses this quarter. We referenced generics. We referenced brand. We referenced specialty. We saw a strong performance across the board. Utilization is certainly strong across the board. I also wanted to highlight our performance on delivering this very strong volume was also positive. The one thing to maybe add to this as well, the -- we talked about a new customer that was onboarded Q3 of last year. And that was -- they were onboarded in the prior year Q3, but there's always a ramp-up process there. So we did see some benefit this quarter relative to last year in terms of this customer now being fully onboarded. So we had a bit of a benefit there, not to the extent of what we saw in the last couple of quarters. And then the last piece that has been -- was very robust this quarter as well. That was not the case in the prior year, certainly were the GLP-1s that Aaron had mentioned. So it was a combination of strength across customer class customers, trade -- class of trade as well as the individual business units. All right. So now you can go ahead to the next question. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Sorry about that. Our next question is coming from Daniel Grosslight calling from Citi. Daniel Grosslight : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I had a similar question, but more on the EBIT for Pharma. Nice raise obviously this quarter. But I'm curious if you can kind of break out for us the nonrecurring items in a little more detail in the Pharma EBIT raise and how much will be recurring in fiscal '24? Thanks. Aaron Alt : Well, I think the benefit of them being nonrecurring items is they won't recur into fiscal '24. If your question is more on Q4, I think the answer is similar in that way. For the Pharma segment, we saw strength across the board. It was a stable macro situation. We had the strong underlying fundamentals. We have the good operational performance as well. We did see some modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases and this being the third quarter for us as well, which we don't -- we don't predict are going to repeat as we carry forward. And so I think the story for us for Pharma was a good year so far, a good quarter for Q3. We have -- we raised our guidance for the year, and we'll talk more about fiscal '24 and indeed our long-term expectations for the business during our Investor Day on June 8th. Jason Hollar : Yes. And I'll just add, the way Aaron put it was perfect as it relates to true nonrecurring items, the only one that we could think of that way would have been -- it depends on your assumption of what you think brand inflation will be next year. That was modest. The other part that we did call out that was a benefit from a growth rate perspective year-over-year is that we do see some of our costs related to opioid legal fees and our ERP implementation running a little bit lower than anticipated. Now those are -- that's nonrecurring, right? It just means that we have gotten to a bit more of a normalized level quicker than what we had anticipated. So I do not expect there to be further significant improvements in the out periods out years related to those costs going down even further. It will be something that we'll continue to evaluate and provide updates if that's the case. But it's for those reasons why our implied growth rate in Q4 is more normalized. It's also why we're not communicating anything differently right now for our longer-term targets. And we'll certainly revisit that point when we come together at the Investor Day on June 8th. But generally speaking, we're seeing the strength, whether it's the new customer, the brand inflation or some of these cost drivers trending in the right direction, are all items that we think we are normalizing now on a go-forward basis and why you should expect more normalized margins from here on out. Daniel Grosslight : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Next question is coming from Charles Rhyee calling from TD Cowen. Please go ahead, sir. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to -- just wanted to follow up. I think it was with Eric's question around, you were talking about in that specific instance about insulin pricing and sort of how you can kind of mitigate some of that. Can you just kind of go into, again, for us a little bit, how your fee-for-service contracts are arranged generally? And maybe more specifically, with insulin perhaps ahead of with these changes occurring, and -- because I would have thought that a lot of the language is already built into your contracts that would automate sort of adjudicate to maintain sort of the -- to capture that service that you are providing. And then as a follow-up, you had talked earlier about sort of Red Oak and continuing to perform well in generics. Curious if any work in Red Oak is being done in terms of biosimilars and trying to get better economics on that side as well. Thanks. Jason Hollar : Well, I'm not going to go into the mechanics of a product level contracts and structure. Just go back and reiterate that we feel very confident about our process, our experience, our history with any type of change that comes any other product. Again, as a distributor, we play a role. We play the role of getting the product from the manufacturers to those who need it. And with that will always be changes in the structure and how we go about it. But we -- nothing is different in today's environment than what's been present for the last 50 years of our existence when we'll have to continue to adapt and evolve with this and that's enough to be said there. Aaron Alt : And then with respect to biosimilars, what we would say is that we are quite well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years in that expanding therapeutic area on the sites of care. It's going to -- we believe it's going to come predominantly from products with a greater retailer or a specialty pharmacy presence, which plays to our strength as well as new therapeutic areas such as immunology and ophthalmology. And so we -- our expectation is it will be a tailwind for us as we push ahead into the end of fiscal year '23 and beyond. Jason Hollar : Next question please. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, sir. Next question is from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. Jonathan Yong : Thanks. It's Jonathan Yong on for A.J. here. Just going back to Medical again. I appreciate the comments on the cost improvements that you're doing and how that's going to set up a good framework for '24. But I guess given some of the volume constraints that you're kind of seeing and not seeing the same flow through, how much of improvement related to the cost side, especially on the freight line is tied to actually improving that volume side that you kind of need to flow through. Thanks. Jason Hollar : Well, so it depends on the time frame we're talking about, but for fiscal '25, our ultimate goal of the $650 million that volume impact we're talking about will not materially impact at all the recognition of the inflation mitigation. That is something that does have some volatility quarter-to-quarter, which is exactly what we highlighted as one of the drivers in the guidance change for this year. But it's not something that will impact significantly the future quarters let alone when we get to fiscal '25. And so I think about volume, the volume component of the order of magnitude of the impact and the benefit that we expect for growing this volume is that $75 million that we have on one of the slides in the presentation, that volume pillar of growing Cardinal Health brand products, that is the order of magnitude we're talking about. And so I do not believe long-term that, that spills over and impacts the mitigation and the cost side of that. So you can think about those as independent as it relates to the longer term impacts, they are a bit more mix in the terms of the short term and what that does to how quickly we recognize that, that lower cost, but that is very much just a short-term timing effect. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. And our last question today is going to be coming from Brian Tanquilut calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Kristen Shuman : Hi. This is Kristen Shuman for Brian. And you might have mentioned this earlier, but I just want to clarify. So could you just give some guidance around how much of the Pharma segment EBITDA guidance range is expected to recur in fiscal '24? Thank you. Aaron Alt : Well, we have not provided fiscal year '24 guidance. We're pleased to report the strong performance in Q3. As we've talked about, and indeed, we did raise our guidance overall for Pharma. For the year, we're now expecting the profit guidance to be 10.5% to 12% for the full year. That's in contrast to our earlier guidance of low single digit to mid-single digit. So we are expecting a good finish to the year from this business, and we're excited to see you all on June 8th at our Investor Day presentation. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for any additional closing remarks. Jason Hollar : Yes. Great. Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know that we threw a lot out at you today, but we have a lot going on as an organization and just wanted to share the progress with you and give you more insight to a lot of the key drivers. If I step back and just think about what we went through, certainly, feel terrific about the progress that we're making across the enterprise. Pharma has, of course, a fantastic quarter, a fantastic year, broad-based as we talked. On the Medical side of the business, we have opportunity. We're very, very focused on driving the medical improvement plan. We feel really good about the progress we made are clearly making in three of those four pillars. We have work to do on the underlying volume. We'll have more confidence in where the market is going for that volume also have confidence in the leading indicators that will take for us to get our fair share of that volume. Of course, also, we're very pleased with the cash performance that we had and that we talked about today and that raising that guidance, narrowing the guidance as well. It highlights both the strong cash management that we have, but also the responsible capital deployment that's going along with that. So just again, thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you all of you at the Investor Day on June 8th. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your time. You may now disconnect. Have a good day and goodbye.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Kevin Moran : Good morning and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2023 results, along with our outlook for fiscal year '24. You can find today\u2019s press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Jason Hollar, our Chief Executive Officer; and Aaron Alt, our Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during the discussion today, all our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. For the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we kindly ask to limit yourself to one question, so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 was an inflection point for Cardinal Health with improved performance, strong execution and notable progress against both our short and long-term plans. We delivered record financial performance, including our highest non-GAAP EPS ever, reflecting 14% growth in the prior year. We grew Pharma segment profit an impressive 13% and generated $2.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow. And in Medical, we drove significant sequential improvement in operating performance from a segment loss in the first quarter to over $80 million of segment profit in Q4. This year, we took decisive action to advance our three strategic imperatives; building upon the resiliency of our Pharma segment, executing our Medical Improvement Plan and maximizing shareholder value creation. Consistent with what you heard at our June Investor Day, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to ruthlessly prioritize the core of our business and to better serve our customers so they, in turn, can focus on caring for patients. We simplified how we operate by streamlining our organizational structure, exiting non-core product lines and rationalizing our geographic and manufacturing footprint. We made key leadership changes and governance enhancements, adding talent and key positions across the enterprise and to our Board. We formed and extended the business review committee tasked with evaluating our strategy, portfolio, operations and capital deployment. On that note, we completed our review of the Pharma segment, including announcements at Investor Day to further invest in our Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions business and launched our new Navista Network supporting community oncologists, which I will discuss more later in my remarks. We recently closed our Outcomes merger with BlackRock's Transaction Data Systems, which we see as a big win for pharmacies and an important opportunity to accelerate the business' future growth. We also deployed capital responsibly with a continued eye on maximizing value, and we are positioned with the financial flexibility to continue driving value for shareholders. At Investor Day, we provided preliminary guidance for fiscal '24. With a strong finish to the year and increased confidence as we look ahead, I am pleased that we can raise our fiscal '24 outlook. Later in my remarks, I will share further details on our three strategic priorities. But first, let me hand it over to Aaron to walk you through our financial results and guidance. Aaron Alt : Thanks, Jason, and good morning. I won't bury the lead. Q4 was a strong finish to a year in which with Jason's guidance, the Cardinal team made significant progress against our strategic initiatives. We delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.55 and $5.79 for the full year at the high end of our guidance from Investor Day. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points. We also delivered stronger than expected cash flow, something I will touch on more later. Let's start with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $49.7 billion driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in Pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to Q3, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $504 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we saw volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Increased contributions from brand and specialty products along with nuclear were also a positive factor, partially offset by higher investment and operating expenses, including higher costs to support sales growth. Turning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was flat at $3.8 billion, an improvement in trend. We saw a decrease in products and distribution sales related to lower PP&E volumes and pricing, partially offset by inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. This decrease within products and distribution was offset by growth in at-Home Solutions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered Medical segment profit of $82 million, a nearly $100 million increase from the prior year loss. The results for the quarter were consistent with our Investor Day commentary, composed of approximately $60 million or more core performance driven in connection with the Medical Improvement Plan and approximately $20 million of both seasonality and net favorable onetime items. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives and the normalization of PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. Of note, we achieved our target of exiting fiscal 2023 with at least 50% inflation mitigation. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day, we were encouraged to see early indicators of an improvement in trend with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. We also saw a positive overall contribution from our growth businesses, including at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight and from our ongoing cost optimization measures. Though with significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $560 million, growth of 24%. Moving below the line. Interest and other decreased by $48 million to $16 million due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents and increased income from our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 27% to approximately two percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 256 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in the quarter as we announced at Investor Day. The net result of all of this was fourth quarter EPS of $1.55, growth of 48%. Now, transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. We surpassed the $200 billion revenue mark for the first time. Fiscal '23 revenue increased 13% to $205 billion and gross margin increased 5% to $6.9 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Total company SG&A increased 6% to $4.8 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and higher investments in operating expenses such as higher costs to support sales growth, which were partially offset by our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings increased 3% to $2.1 billion. Interest and other decreased 46% to $89 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 23%. Net result was for fiscal 2023 EPS, $5.79, growth of 14%. As for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma segment profit increased 13% to $2 billion, driven by positive generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. Fiscal '23 year-over-year growth also included a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases, which we are assuming will not repeat in fiscal '24 as well as a favorable prior year comparison related to higher opioid-related legal costs and costs for technology enhancements in fiscal '22. Moving to Medical on Slide 11. Segment profit decreased 49% to $111 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix and net inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. This decline was partially offset by normalization of PP&E margins. Now, before I turn to fiscal '24, let's cover the balance sheet. In fiscal '23, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion with particularly strong cash flow towards the end of the year. We ended the year with $4 billion of cash on hand. At our Investor Day, we highlighted that cash flow optimization was an area of go-forward focus for our teams, and the Cardinal team delivered across our businesses. This effort will continue in fiscal '24, notwithstanding that it is a tougher calendar from an inflow, outflow days-of-week perspective. We remain focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined, and shareholder-friendly manner. In fiscal '23, we invested approximately $480 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down $550 million in debt to reduce leverage and maintain our strong investment-grade ratings, returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders, including through the dividend that our Board increased in May for the 34th year in a row and $2 billion of share repurchases. Now, for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 13. Today, we are raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance to a range of $6.50 to $6.75. This increase reflects the strong finish to fiscal '23, particularly within Pharma where we are now entering the year at a higher jump-off point. We also are tightening our shares range to 250 million to 253 million, which reflects the recent share repurchases as well as our continued expectation of $500 million in base share repurchases over the course of fiscal '24. As you will calculate, the midpoint of our newly raised fiscal '24 EPS guidance is 15% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. There are no changes to the other corporate guidance assumptions provided at Investor Day. Interest and other between $110 million to $130 million, and effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal '24.  Our segment outlooks for fiscal '24 are also unchanged with one exception, a high revenue range for Pharma driven by the continued acceleration of GLP-1s, which, as a branded product category, do not meaningfully contribute to segment profit. Slide 14 shows our fiscal '24 outlook for Pharma, our build and grow business. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth in the range of 4% to 6%, which is now on a larger fiscal '23 reference point due to our strong finish to the year. We are reiterating our key assumptions provided at Investor Day. We expect growth from our generics program with volume growth and consistent market dynamics and positive operational execution against our organic specialty efforts. We are not assuming outsized benefits from branded inflation. In contrast, some of the benefits that we did see in fiscal '23. On the Pharma fiscal '24 cadence, we expect the year to follow typical seasonality patterns. As usual, we see our fiscal Q3 being the largest segment profit dollar quarter due to the usual timing of branded manufacturer price increases. Turning to Medical. I want to recognize the progress that the Medical team made during fiscal '23, particularly in Q4, and also acknowledge that we still have blocking and tackling to do against the turnaround to both drive demand and improve our cost. For the full year, we are reiterating our assumptions of revenue growth of approximately 3% and segment profit of approximately $400 million for the year, while providing some additional color. Like fiscal '23, we anticipate segment profit to be significantly back-half weighted. We expect Q1 to be generally consistent with the core performance from Q4 with quarterly sequential improvements thereafter driven by our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. There are a couple of factors for why Q1 is the low point in the year. First, keep in mind that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our global Medical products and distribution business due to the timing of volume and cost recognition. Second, while we continue to expect to exit fiscal '24 offsetting the impact of gross inflation, those improvements are expected to grow over time, making the impact greater over the course of the year. And finally, we continue to plan for slight Cardinal Health brand volume growth that will largely hit in the second half of the fiscal year. So in summary for Medical for fiscal year '24, continued work in front of us with each quarter improving from our Q1 launching point to get us to the approximately $400 million guidance for the year. Stepping back, we are pleased to see growth across our businesses continuing in fiscal '24. Consistent with our messaging from Investor Day, we are targeting a 12% to 14% EPS growth CAGR for fiscal '24 to 2026, now from the higher fiscal '23 baseline of $5.79. Now regarding our intended deployment of cash, which is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework as seen on Slide 18. After investing approximately $500 million back into the business to drive organic growth, making approximately $500 million of litigation payments, including our third payment under the national opioid settlement back in July, and our $1 billion baseline return on capital, we expect to have strong flexibility as we assess further investments in the business, M&A and the possibility of incremental return of capital to shareholders. I want to reiterate that as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal '24 guidance or our long-term targets reflect potential opportunistic deployment of capital, including M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude or additional share repurchases beyond our $500 million of baseline repurchases each year. We will continue to evaluate both of these levers opportunistically to drive long-term value. To close, the Cardinal team has a lot to be proud of with respect to their accomplishments in fiscal '23. Jason and I are pleased with the progress our teams have made. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of Cardinal Health. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. Let's now dive deeper into the actions we are taking to execute our three strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. In our largest most significant business, the Pharma segment has been performing well by prioritizing what matters most, focusing on the core and delivering for our customers and their patients. The business is positioned at the forefront of favorable secular industry trends and has also benefited from our specific actions and performance. We are pleased to recently raise our long-term segment profit target to 4% to 6% growth, solidly in the mid-single digits and consistent with the segment profit growth we expect in fiscal '24. Our growth is enabled by a scaled, stable and resilient core Pharmaceutical distribution business growing in the low single digits and double-digit growth from our higher-margin specialty and Nuclear businesses. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component of our overall offering and performance, enabled by Red Oak Sourcing. In addition to its leading scale, Red Oak's proprietary analytical tools and deep industry expertise puts us in the best position possible whenever product shortages occur to continue servicing customers. We're committed to providing customer-focused solutions across our many classes of trade as we noted at Investor Day. More recently, we hosted our 31st Annual Retail Business Conference, where we brought together nearly 4,500 attendees from across the country to celebrate the critical role independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities and showcase our commitment to our customers through our newest innovations. For example, we are offering modern payment solutions through our collaboration with Square to help independent pharmacies seamlessly manage business operations, integrate flexible payment options, and reduce payment processing costs. We've conveyed that specialty is our priority area of focus and a key enabler to our long-term growth. We're continuing to invest to expand downstream across key therapeutic areas such as oncology, rheumatology and other emerging areas. We're excited to build upon our existing capabilities with the recent launch of our Navista Network, a specific suite of offerings for community oncologists, supporting their growth and desire to remain independent. To ensure the Navista Network's success in development, we've recently appointed new leadership with deep industry and clinical experience and continue to build out the organization with internal and external talent. We continue to seek input from customers and have created an advisory board. While still early innings, I'm pleased with the engagement from current and potential customers. Upstream in specialty, we're expecting continued double-digit growth from manufacturer services. In our leading 3PL, we're expanding our ambient and cold chain space to keep up with our business' strong growth. At an excess access and patient support, we delivered on a record number of new client implementations and continue to launch new innovative products to streamline the patient journey. We're also supporting the growth of Pharmaceutical manufacturers in the cell and gene therapy space through our advanced therapy solutions offerings. For example, we're partnering with TrakCel to bring visibility and tracking capabilities to biopharma companies by helping them navigate cell therapies through multiple stages of development and commercialization. Overall in specialty, we're confident that the connection between our downstream and upstream strategies, what we call our specialty growth cycle, will drive double-digit growth well into the future. Our Nuclear business, which is on track to double profits by fiscal '26 as of our fiscal '21 baseline, is strategically positioned for growth at the center of precision medicine. We're further investing in the space with a Phase 2 investment of $30 million over the next several years to expand our center for theranostics advancement and support our manufacturer partners' projects as they advance through the commercial development pipeline. We're encouraged to see Pharmaceutical innovation expanding the breadth of conditions that are being addressed with emerging therapies such as cell and gene and precision medicine. As the future of health care continues to evolve, our breadth of capabilities from Pharmaceutical and specialty distribution, radiopharmaceuticals and theranostics to biopharma and manufacturer services enables us to offer multiple touch points for manufacturers, providers and patients to realize value from these promising new treatment options. Now, turning to Medical and priority number two. When we introduced the Medical Improvement Plan last August, our immediate focus was turning around the performance in the core product and distribution, where we've achieved tremendous progress over the past 12 months. We are on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24. This is the number one key to returning to a more normalized level of profitability, and we are now over halfway to our target. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation and make progress with our commercial contracting efforts. And we are exploring other offsets with urgency such as our manufacturing excellence and sourcing initiatives. While overall costs remain elevated, international freight has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this improvement to be reflected in our fiscal '24 results. We're driving significant progress through our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume and seeing improvements in our leading indicators. This includes better portfolio health for key product categories and higher service levels, customer loyalty index scores and retention rates for distribution. We're driving enhanced customer experience through investments in product availability and automation while optimizing costs. At Investor Day, we highlighted our two-pronged approach to portfolio life cycle management, which has enabled us to completely exit our non-health care portfolio. And we are in the process of reducing over 2,000 SKUs across our Cardinal Health Branded product categories to simplify the business. We're focusing our investments in new product development and capacity expansion in key growth areas such as compression, enteral feeding and incontinence. Within our products that are core to distribution, we've seen continued stabilization with PPE, a smaller part of our portfolio but a source of volatility during the pandemic and growth in our pre-sourced surgical fitting category. In our specialty products portfolio comprised of clinically differentiated products and leading brands like Kangaroo, Kendall and Protexis, we're investing in innovation to meet customers' needs and drive sustainable growth. For example, the launch of our new Kangaroo OMNI\u2122 Enteral Feeding system this month. As a result of our combined efforts, commercial momentum is accelerating. During Q4, we renewed several key distribution customers and saw positive net new wins during the quarter. These leading indicators give us confidence that moving forward we'll participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment. Outside the core, we're on track to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we're investing in DC network expansion to keep pace with increased demand as care continues to shift into the home. For example, we've recently begun construction for a new 350,000 square foot Greenville, South Carolina, DC. This facility, the 11th in our national network will be fully operational in 18 to 24 months and equipped with advanced automation technology and robotics to drive operational efficiencies. In OptiFreight, we provide premier logistics management powered by our technology capabilities and expertise. We're continuing to invest in digital tools to support core volume growth and sustain our strong performance. Finally, we continue to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives such as optimizing our global manufacturing and supply chain and our international footprint. For example, we exited four additional countries and two additional manufacturing sites this year. In short, we are making progress with our Medical Improvement Plan. While there is still execution in front of us, I'm excited for the business to return to more significant profitability in fiscal '24. Finally, priority number three, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through operational performance, robust cash flow generation and the responsible allocation of capital. At Investor Day, Aaron detailed our new long-term capital allocation framework, which builds upon our long-standing priorities with some notable enhancements. We're pleased that with our strong cash flow profile and the significant progress we've made on our balance sheet, we have the flexibility for share repurchases each and every year. And with the residual cash flow that we anticipate, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. While our team has made significant progress over the past year, particularly in realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to evaluate additional value creation initiatives, including the progress we are making with our ongoing business and portfolio review. To wrap up, I want to acknowledge our dedicated Cardinal Health employees who are fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. Thank you for your determination and advancing our key priorities and moving healthcare forward. I'm excited for the opportunities still to come. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I just really want to start with the GLP-1 comment. So I understand you're raising revenue by 200 basis points. One, is that all GLP-1? And two, my understanding is that they are a lower margin, but they are contributory to overall margin dollars. Is that not the case when you're keeping the profit the same and when I think about the Pharmaceutical segment for '24? Aaron Alt : Yes. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the question. Yes, the primary reason for the raise in the guidance on the revenue is related to the GLP-1. So we did not call out anything else. We saw a strong finish to the year as it relates to that. And looking forward, we see that there's nothing that we can foresee in the near term that will change those trends. As a reminder, we did call out for the first time GLP-1 as a benefit to our revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective in the third quarter. So we have kind of a -- there was growth before that, but not as significant. And so it was more meaningful in Q3 and Q4. So as you look forward to fiscal '24, you would expect that revenue growth to be stronger in the first half of the year as that's more of a contributor. Now of course, we don't know what that slope is going to look like into '24, but we would anticipate as you start to lap the second half of 2023 that, that will be more muted in terms of the year-over-year benefit. And I guess what -- as it relates to your second part of your question, I would just reiterate that these are branded products. And as such, they're just not a meaningful contributor to segment profit and just leave it at that. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Eric Percher : Thanks for all the commentary on Medical performance. I want to make sure we're kind of precise on the core performance and the stepping off point there would be around $60 million, not $82 million. And then, can you define seasonality and one-time benefits this quarter, and any expectation that those will recur as we look at that cadence for fiscal year '24? Jason Hollar : Eric, good morning. Good to hear your voice and happy to give you a little more context on that. Look, we were quite pleased with the results for Medical, as you can imagine, delivering that $82 million of results. That was $60 million of what we're referring to as for performance and $20 million in aggregate combined positive seasonality and one-time items in the fourth quarter. And I called -- I call it out purposely that way because it does impact how we think through the cadence of quarters during fiscal '24. Now before giving you a little more context on the quarterly guidance, I do want to go back and just observe that we are reiterating the $400 million profit target for the Medical segment from the year. The Medical Improvement Plan, the key components, that remain unchanged from our description at the Investor Day as well. But we are providing a little more color relative to how we see the year playing out, given the number of moving pieces on the blocking and tackling as I referred to in my prepared remarks as we carry forward. So look, from a full year perspective, the way I would have you think about it is this. As I said at Investor Day, if you take $60 million of core performance and multiply that by 4, that gets you to $240 million of profit, right? If you add $100 million of incremental inflation net on top of that, that gets you to $340 million in total. And as we talked about at Investor Day, that leaves about $60 million of contribution from other elements across the year, the simplification of the Cardinal Health brand, et cetera. That's a full year view of how to think about it. Now as we think about the cadence, though, we are being clear that the profit will be back-half weighted during the year just like it was in fiscal year '23. Our view is that Q1 will have similar core performance with Q4 with sequential performance thereafter. Q1 is the seasonal low point for the Med Products and Distribution business due to both the timing of volume as well as our cost recognition. That's an important point. And similarly, we do expect that continued acceleration of inflation mitigation over the course of the year as well. So that will push the profit from a weighting perspective in the back half. And then don't forget that while we were very pleased to call out a sign of change in trend in Cardinal Health brand, we're also clear at Investor Day that the Cardinal Health brand volume growth is largely back-half weighted. Hope that helps. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Maybe to follow-up on that a little bit. So if we're thinking about $82 million , the baseline is really $60 million, the first quarter is likely because of the $20 million in seasonals' and one-timers. The first quarter is likely to be down sequentially and then grow off that base to get to the $400 million. I just want to make sure that, that's what you're committing to or commenting on. And then secondly, or incrementally, the new products or the Cardinal brand products, is that -- the increase in the back half of the year? Is that because of new product launches or manufacturing capabilities? Is it contractually like new contracts coming on that are higher weighted? Can you just sort of explain the dynamics of the Cardinal brand products as well? Aaron Alt : Well, I'll start, and then toss it over to Jason. You are correct in that the way we're thinking about this is that core performance Q4 to Q1 will be roughly in line. And if you interpret what I was just saying in response to an earlier question, we do have some negative seasonality in Q1 versus Q4. So that's why the jumping off point is core performance versus the Q4 results. Jason? Jason Hollar : Yes. I'd think about the Cardinal brand volume growth being back half-loaded through a couple of different lenses. First of all, we do think that the underlying utilization will be -- for the market will continue to be relatively consistent. So we do see same-store sales growth out there, and we anticipate that, that will continue. And within our performance within that, we highlighted that our comparison point to the prior year is becoming easier as we did lose some business over the last 18 months or so that we now are lapping and our five-point plan is working. Our five-point plan to improve -- that includes improving the customer experience and importantly, that supply chain health. We're seeing strong progress as it relates to service levels, CLI scores that gave us very good customer retention in the quarter, net new wins that were positive in the quarter. That gives us the foundation that -- that gives us confidence that we'll grow with the underlying market, especially as we continue to lap that prior year impact, which we think will be more impactful in the second half of the year. So all the leading indicators are going as anticipated and consistent with how we laid it out at the Investor Day and gives us the visibility and the confidence that we'll be able to participate in that market growth that we anticipate that will be there over the course of this next year. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Yes. Good morning guys. And thanks for taking my questions. I'll take it in a little bit different direction. Jason, I'd love to hear the kind of the progress that you guys have made on the Navista offering, since it was first announced at the Analyst Day. And I guess, given the growth and the size of the specialty market, particularly in oncology, I guess how should we think about the ramp of that business maybe through fiscal '24 and beyond, so just kind of progress in ramping contribution? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Sure. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, George. Yes, so when we think about Navista, I think it's important to recognize that we had a foundation in place. We have a foundation in place, built off of our existing specialty business. We had plenty of programs and initiatives in platforms like our, Navista TS, where we are already providing capabilities to the community oncologists to help support their value-based care initiatives, of course, other data and insights, clinical research support. So we have a lot of the tools. What Navista Network is doing is, bringing that all together in the form of a business with new additional senior leadership brought in place. So that's one of the key things that's happened since the announcement a couple of months ago, is we have brought in additional leadership to bring on top of the strong team that we already had in place that were already serving these important customers and their patients. So we are building that out further with both internal as well as external talent. We also created an advisory board to ensure that we are working directly with both current and prospective customers, more than anything to make sure that they have a strong voice as to where we go next with the development of this platform in this business. We continue to listen and be out in the field doing a lot of research, but we're also building what we're already notably to be some of the key attributes of this platform and this network that they're demanding. What's key and what we highlighted before is that these are the 1,500 that we're focused on here are very strongly interested in maintaining their independence. We're also hearing a strong desire for ongoing transparency, which as health care's most trusted partner, we feel like we're really well positioned for. So it's only been a couple of months since we rolled this out. But in that time frame, we've got the team in place, better definition of what the platform needs to be built out with and continue to work with those prospective customers to make sure that their needs are met. Next question, please. Operator : Next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I don't know if you could comment on the corporate costs that you just discussed in Medical, the $60 million. Is that something that you also expect to like ramp ratably over the course of the year? Is that something that has gone through, those cuts are going through -- have gone through already and are just annualizing? A little bit more help there would be very helpful. And then secondarily, can you talk about what is different about getting this next 50% of the inflation offset this year that was not the same last year? We obviously know that you've been getting more price \u2013 in your contracts, et cetera, but I'm just looking for any more additional commentary you can provide on what might be different about this remaining 50%. Thanks. Jason Hollar : Okay. I think I caught the essence at least part of that. So let me start. I believe part of the question was related to the next part of the inflation mitigation in the second half. I think the other question related to the corporate cost ramp. So let me start with the second part and then throw it over to Aaron for the first part. So as you think about the inflation mitigation and the next piece, there's -- it's really the same for the second 50% as it was the first 50%. So in both cases, what we've seen is a moderation of the international freight. That spiked significantly about two years ago and started coming down about a year ago and got back down to pre-pandemic levels maybe six to nine months ago. So that has been -- started to benefit us as we especially exited fiscal '23. So we did start to see that. It, of course, was inventoried into our inventory, capitalized those costs into our inventories. So it took a little while for that to benefit our P&L as a cost reduce. And along the way, in parallel with that, of course, we were pricing mainly on a temporary basis the first year for those increases as well as increases in other commodity costs and transportation, domestic transportation, increased labor and all those other costs. All those other costs have plateaued. They are not coming down. We don't see any signs of them coming down. And so we have to price permanently for those items. We priced temporarily for the international freight. And as those costs on the international freight roll off, we need to maintain higher prices. And so we are continuing to price and some of those temporary prices are now being rolled into the permanent prices. And so we would expect that as those contracts renew that we'll continue to see more and more of that pricing recognized. I mean, to be very clear, we're not rolling back prices. We've not increased prices beyond the point of our costs. At the 50% level, we're still only being compensated for half of that overall gross impact that we've incurred. But over the course of this year, we do expect the international freight to come down. And by the time we exit fiscal '24, the prices will continue to increase as we go through the course of the year as we get more of those contracts renewed permanently, and then that will cross over with the lower cost, and then we'll exit in that manner at the end of the year. Aaron, on the first question? Aaron Alt : Sure. I think I heard a couple of different things, and so I'm going to answer the question I think I heard, and it goes something like this. So we did -- I did comment earlier that in addition to the annualization of the core performance and indeed the inflation mitigation that Jason just touched on that there was $60 million of other benefit coming over the course of the year really driven by the three other pillars within the Med Improvement Plan, the contribution of the growth businesses, the simplification and the Cardinal Health brand work. As I was touching on, that work progresses over the course of the year, and we've seen more benefit towards the back half of the year. I want to emphasize the simplification efforts. Steve and the team are working really hard at that every day. We just see the benefit coming more in the back half. The growth businesses are making good progress. They have some seasonality as well. They are certainly a strong contributor to the additional $60 million over the course of the year. And then Jason has already touched on Cardinal Health brand, so I won't go there. Jason Hollar : Next question please, operator? Operator : The next question comes from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Daniel Grosslight : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one quick housekeeping question, and then I'll ask my real question. There was a slight change in the language around your inflation mitigation efforts from your ID presentation to your current presentation. You went from fully mitigating by the end of '24 to just mitigating. Curious if there's been some change in how you're thinking about things? Or if it was kind of a simplification of the language?  And then my real question is around the generics business. It seems like you and your competitors have all benefited from a more favorable environment. And it seems like it might have accelerated towards the end of your fiscal year. So I'm just curious to get your thoughts on the generics market potential shortages and how you're thinking about the benefit or tailwind of generics in your fiscal '24 guidance vis-a-vis the strength you saw in fiscal '23. Thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. So in terms of the language change for inflation mitigation, I think you said it best. It's a simplification language. The one thing I would highlight is similar to our disclosures with COVID, over time, those became more difficult to precisely measure. So now we are -- and this inflation mitigation was always focused on the incremental inflation because we had spikes, unusual dramatic spikes in inflation. Well, there's normal inflation as well. So this is just a little bit broader language to recognize that over time, it's becoming harder to differentiate between the two. We have a good understanding of the most significant impacts like the international freight. But when you get into labor, what's normal, what's incremental, it becomes more challenging. And we just have a little bit broader language to recognize that it is going to be less precise than it was early on in our measurement. We're still doing as deep of analytics as possible to get a reasonable understanding of it. As it relates to \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I think the key takeaway with that is we are on track, right, the ultimately, the strategy makes sense. It should be pushed down to the final customer, the final user of the products and services, given the business model. And so we believe that the basic tenets are absolutely unchanged. It's just reflecting the level of precision. On your second question as it relates to generics, as I step back and think about performance for the Pharma segment this year, inclusive of generics, I think you can think about the overall segment as well as the generics business. There's a couple of things that have occurred. There is the overall market utilization has been very strong, and our performance has been very good within that. And it's at levels that for all the reasons Aaron highlighted is that a growth rate is a bit higher than what normal is and certainly higher than what our long-term growth targets are. And as I think forward to fiscal '24, we expect that to normalize. We expect it to still be favorable growth. We indicated during Investor Day in the 2% to 3% type of range from a unit volume growth, and we would expect to participate within that. And we expect our performance to continue with areas like Red Oak Sourcing to continue to drive both the cost as well as to your other related point, the product shortages. They have a dual mandate to drive performance for both cost as well as service levels to customers. So while there are product shortages sporadic within the overall Pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, that's not a new phenomenon. There's various demand driven spikes and supply driven spikes. Our goal, of course, is to minimize those challenges within that to give our customers the best possible service. And what we saw, in fact, in fiscal '23, it was a little bit of a benefit by being able to supply products as a second distributor as not the primary distributor, but we had some opportunities where we were able to provide when others were short on product. So overall, that was a slight positive for us this year as well. And we expect those types of things to be more normalized in fiscal '24 and feel well-positioned to participate in that growth. Aaron Alt : I would just add one thought, which is in Q4, we saw strong volume, as Jason highlighted, but overall consistent market dynamics. And indeed, as we look forward, Jason called out the unit growth, but we are also guiding to consistent market dynamics for the upcoming year as well. Jason Hollar : Next question please. Operator : Next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I know on your Medical side, there's a lot going on, and you're a little more skewed toward inpatient than some of the others that have reported. But we've heard this discussion about an uptick in utilization from some of the providers. And I wondered if I peel back everything that's going on in Medical, did you see any change in behavior on the part of your customers to suggest that there was an uptick in utilization? And then just on the PPE comment, you're calling it normalization of profits from here. Do you think sequentially from here, we're pretty steady? And as we return to a normal environment, is there any seasonality around that category to call out to remember when we get back to a normal environment? Jason Hollar : Yes. The utilization, we think, has been fairly consistent. I wouldn't call it an acceleration or anything. We're seeing pretty consistent underlying same-store sales type of growth. So it's sufficient within our business model and where we laid it out from Investor Day, but I wouldn't call out anything unique there. As it relates to PPE normalization, a couple of points. So normalized is good for us. This is not a category that we've ever made a tremendous amount of money and value. It's an important category for our customers. And so we do everything we can to satisfy their needs. So going forward, our objective is to ensure that we get customers the product they need and minimize the volatility that goes along with that. But I just don't see it being a material driver one way or the other. Recall that the challenges with PPE was that we had volatile price cost and volume all at once. What you have right now is a normalization that's been occurring over the last couple of years of both price and cost has been coming down somewhat steadily. And they've been staying in a relative type of spread close enough to one another that, that's been manageable. And it's that volume that's been a little bit more challenging. We've highlighted that it was destocking beginning about -- well, over a year ago now in terms of the underlying volume there. But given the margins are relatively tight for this type of product, getting those margins right and relatively low margins means that the volume volatility or the lack of volume growth is not much of an issue for us, because it's just not a large contributor of incremental volume or incremental margins. So we're at a level that I think it's fairly stable, and it's our objective to keep it that way. Next question, please operator. Operator : Our final question today comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] in for Brian. I had a question about your capital allocation priorities for the fiscal year '24. Generated quite a bit of free cash flow this fiscal year. And I'm just curious if there's any specifics you can get into with regards to where you see capital allocation in the next fiscal year? Thank you. Aaron Alt : Hi, great question. Thank you for putting it on the table for us. Look, we were very focused on our Investor Day in laying out the disciplined capital allocation decision matrix that we apply. And we were also very pleased to see the overall cash generation for fiscal '23 and Q4 in particular. Here's the simple answer. We're going to do what we said we were going to do at Investor Day in that respect. And just as a quick reminder, there are a couple of things which are table stakes for us, which is first, we're going to invest back into the business to drive the organic growth. We spent 480 in fiscal '23. We've guided we're going to spend about $500 million in CapEx against our business plans across the business. Our second priority, of course, is maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. And you'll recall from our Investor Day that we don't have short-term maturities. We have some bonds coming due at the end of the year that we will likely just refinance. But we're feeling good about our investment-grade balance sheet  And then we've committed to a baseline of return of capital to shareholders, continuing to grow the dividend. We've raised it 34 years in a row. Similarly, we committed to buy back at least $500 million of shares during fiscal year '23. Those are the table stakes parts of how we're going to use our cash. As we then move through the year, as we assess the opportunities in front of us, as we assess how the business is performing, we have two opportunistic levers that we will also be looking at. The first is active, disciplined and targeted M&A largely in specialty, and we have opportunities there that we're looking at as well. And then on top of that, we will also continue to look at incremental return of capital to shareholders. Nothing additional to announce today on either of those two levers. But we want to be clear that we are going to do what we said we were going to do with respect to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's call. I would now like to turn the call over to CEO, Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks. Jason Hollar : Okay, great. Thanks again for joining us this morning. To summarize, fiscal '23 was a great year. It was a year of inflection, and we are excited to continue this momentum into fiscal '24 and beyond. With that, thank you and have a great day. Operator : And that does conclude the fourth quarter full year '23 Cardinal Health, Inc. earnings conference call. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Overall, it was a great start to our fiscal year, with strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the year, we are continuing our operating momentum into fiscal 2024. In the first quarter, we delivered significant profit growth in both segments. In Pharma, the results were driven by the strength across our business, including continued positive performance from our generics program. We also benefited from our role distributing the recently commercialized COVID-19 vaccines, which I'll elaborate on later in my remarks. Macro trends in the core distribution business remains stable, and we continue to see strong pharmaceutical demand, including the GLP-1 medications. And both our higher-growth specialty nuclear businesses tracked ahead of plan in the quarter. In Medical, the first quarter was another proof point of the inflection we began to see last Q2 in this business. Recall, the segment was unprofitable only a year ago. Overall, results tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, and we continue to execute our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives to drive better and more predictable financial performance. In particular, we made notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter. At an enterprise level, we realized notable operating leverage from our efforts to manage costs across the segments. And below the operating line, our favorable capital structure and responsible capital deployment provided tailwinds, enabled by our strong cash flow generation. In short, the broad-based performance to-date gives us confidence to raise fiscal 2024 EPS guidance only a quarter into the year. Our team continues to prioritize focused execution to best serve our customers and create value for shareholders. I'll update you on our progress in advancing our three key strategic imperatives shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail. Aaron Alt : Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Q1 delivered a strong financial start to the year, with EPS of $1.73, surpassing our expectations in Pharma and Medical. The strength of our pharma business, the progress on our medical turnaround efforts and our disciplined approach to capital allocation contributed to new first quarter highs for the enterprise on both revenue and EPS. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash. Let's start with the consolidated enterprise results, as seen on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 10% to $54.8 billion, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin also increased 10% to $1.8 billion, driven by both the Medical and Pharma segments. Consolidated SG&A was generally in line with the prior year at $1.2 billion, reflecting our disciplined cost management across the enterprise. With the significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $571 million, growth of 35%. Moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased by $15 million to $12 million, due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.5%, an increase of approximately 5.5 percentage points. We saw positive discrete items in both the current and prior year periods, which were more beneficial a year ago. First quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 250 million, 8% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result was first quarter EPS of $1.73, an all-time first quarter high point, reflecting growth of 44%. Let's turn to the Pharma segment on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 11% to $51 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to trends last year, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 18% to $507 million in the first quarter, driven by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which provided a modest contribution as customers stocked up in preparation for the fall vaccination season. We also saw positive generics program performance with continued volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at $3.8 billion was largely flat to prior year and prior quarter. In the first quarter, we saw lower PP&E volume and pricing, including the impact from the prior year exit of our non-health care gloves portfolio, offset by growth in at-Home Solutions and inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. Medical slightly exceeded our expectations in Q1 and delivered segment profit of $71 million, which represents an approximate $80 million increase from the prior year's first quarter loss. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day and last quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the indicators of improvement in trends with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. In Q1, we saw a slight year-over-year volume growth. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. We also continue to see normalized PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. In the quarter, we also recorded a $581 million non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This Q1 accounting charge is due to an increase in the discount rate used in goodwill impairment analysis. Now turning to the balance sheet. As I alluded to earlier, in the first quarter, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would and deploying capital in balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. In the first quarter, we continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing $92 million of CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth. We made our third annual payment on our national opioid settlement obligation. We did not draw on our credit facilities and received a positive change to the outlook on our investment-grade rating from Fitch as well as from S&P in Q2. We returned over $630 million to shareholders through payment of our quarterly dividend and the launch of a new $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which completed in October. Now for our updated fiscal 2024 guidance, on Slide 8. Today, we are raising our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance to a range of $6.75 to $7, the midpoint of which is 19% above our fiscal 2023 EPS result. This $0.25 increase to our EPS range primarily reflects an improvement to our Pharma outlook as well as some improvement below the line. We are raising our Pharma segment profit guide to 7% to 9% growth for the year and are pleased with the momentum in the business. Our updated guidance reflects the strong first quarter performance, higher than originally assumed contributions from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which continued into October; the ongoing strength of our business, consistent with a 4% to 6% growth trajectory for the segment on a normalized basis. Finally, as a reminder, on the Pharma quarterly cadence, we continue to assume Q3 branded inflation will not repeat at fiscal 2023 levels. In Medical, we are reiterating our outlook of $400 million of segment profit for the year. Recall, that we previously guided that Medical segment profit would be significantly back-half weighted. That assumption remains unchanged. The first half-second half cadence continues to be driven by progress on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation and some business-specific seasonality. While we are encouraged that the business slightly overperformed relative to our expectation in Q1, due to execution against our plans and our cost management efforts, our expectation for Q2 segment profit is unchanged from our original guidance, which reflected some seasonality in Q2-specific expenses like health and wellness. Altogether, Q2 segment profit should be slightly higher than Q1, which benefited from overdelivery. We expect continued progress from our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives over the course of the year. Below the line, interest and other is reduced to a range of $100 million to $120 million, while we are maintaining an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We do expect the tax favorability we saw in the first quarter to be offset in Q2. We are also lowering our shares outlook to approximately $249 million, which reflects the already completed $500 million of our baseline share repurchase. I want to reiterate that, as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal 2024 guidance nor our long-term targets reflect M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude, or additional opportunistic deployments of capital to share repurchases beyond our baseline repurchase. We will continue to evaluate both opportunistically to drive long-term value. So, an overall successful first quarter. The Cardinal team is a lot to be proud of with respect to our accomplishments. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of us. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron Now for a few updates regarding our recent progress on our three key strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment. The key enabler to the pharma business is outstanding performance over a number of quarters now, has been the team's consistent prioritization of what matters most, operational execution in the core. We're leveraging our scale, efficiency and breadth of essential products and service capabilities to deliver for our customers and their patients. Within the core, our generics program remains a critical component. Our performance is anchored by Red Oak Sourcing, which continues to do a fantastic job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply to help maximize service delivery for customers. I recently saw our customer-focused mindset on display when I visited our specialty pharmaceutical distribution facility in La Vergne, Tennessee, where team worked extensively to prepare for commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, while maintaining their terrific service for our other specialty products. Our team successfully navigated complex cold chain requirements for the vaccines, enabling us to quickly meet demand and begin making shipments immediately following FDA approval in time for the fall immunization season. We're pleased to support our customers in this manner, which patients rely upon for care, convenience and accessibility. We're committed to supporting customers and manufacturers, and our strategic sourcing and manufacturer services team recently hosted hundreds of our supplier partners for our annual business partners' conference. It was energizing to hear the excitement around various industry opportunities, such as biosimilars and emerging areas like cell and gene. We are confident about our ability to continue to be a strategic partner for manufacturers, investing in the important drugs being developed and commercialized in this space. We've continued to see strong momentum across our specialty business, both downstream and upstream, and have reiterated our focus on this space. We are very sizable today in specialty with over $30 billion in fiscal '23 revenue, which we noted at Investor Day has grown at a 14% CAGR over the last three years. We are making progress building out our Navista network offerings, with investments in the platform that will scale over time. Our differentiated model in community oncology is focused on driving practice growth and sharing value, while maintaining practice independence. Our approach is being refined through engagement with clinicians and our customer advisory board. Overall, we are developing solutions strategically aligned supporting the clinical and operational needs of community oncologists that drive long-term practice independence and allow physicians to focus on patient care. In nuclear, the business continues its double-digit growth trajectory, with strong performance across our core categories and Theranostics. We continue to experience increasing demand for our Center for Theranostics Advancement, with more than 60 projects at various stages in our pipeline with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners. We're progressing on our Phase II investment that we announced at Investor Day. Our innovation center and pre-commercial manufacturing center are already highly utilized. We're underway in progressing according to plan with the expansions of our central pharmacy capability and our commercial manufacturing center. With our strong foundation and continued investment, the nuclear business is well on track to deliver its long-term target of doubling profits by fiscal '26 relative to our fiscal '21 baseline. Now, turning to medical and priority number two. The medical business has now delivered back-to-back quarters of meaningfully improved profitability, and we expect more to come. As part of our medical improvement plan, we've been taking action to address the challenges in the core products and distribution business, with the number one priority being mitigating supply chain inflation. We remain on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24, and we're pleased to note we are now over 70% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation are making progress with our commercial contracting efforts and are seeing benefits from our additional actions, such as our sourcing initiatives. Additionally, we've been taking action through our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume, which has yielded improvements. We are utilizing a balanced portfolio approach and have made important line extensions within our core products to fill portfolio gaps critical to our distribution offering. We've also highlighted investments we're making in new product development and commercialization for our clinically differentiated specialty medical products, which culminated in two notable product launches during the quarter. We launched our anticipated Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding Pump in the U.S., designed to help provide enteral feeding patients with more options to meet their nutritional needs throughout their enteral feeding journey, from hospital to home. We also announced the launch of our next-generation NTrainer System 2.0, a medical device designed to help premature in newborn infants develop with the oral coordination skills to make the transition to independent feeding faster and help reduce their NICU length of stay. I'm excited about what our products can do for patients and the progress we're making as we now turn to playing more offense to grow our Cardinal Health brand portfolio.  We're continuing to see the results of our actions benefiting our leading indicators, such as our customer experience metrics and portfolio health for key categories, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to better participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment moving forward. For example, we've seen further improvement in our Customer Loyalty Index score for U.S. distribution beyond the 13-point increase in the last two years that we noted at Investor Day. And we've seen a continued reduction in our product back orders, which are now at a multiyear low and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Outside of product and distribution, we're continuing to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care increasingly shifts to the home. Our team's focus on operational efficiency is producing better operating leverage in this business, resulting in increased contributions to the bottom-line. To wrap-up the Medical, we're continuing to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives across the segment, which contributed to the strong SG&A management in the quarter. Finally, priority number 3, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron detailed, our confidence in our cash flow generation enabled execution of our fiscal 2024 baseline share repurchases, continued evidence of our willingness to return excess capital to shareholders and our value creation through capital deployment. With our financial flexibility, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. We continue to actively evaluate a range of potential partners or acquisition candidates for both the downstream and upstream elements for our specialty strategy, but have been clear that our long-term growth targets are not predicated on inorganic investment. We are making progress with our ongoing business and portfolio review focused on the Medical segment. While across the company, our team has made significant progress over the past year realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to work collaboratively with our Business Review Committee to evaluate additional value creation initiatives and expect to provide further updates in the coming quarters. To close, we had a great first quarter and are excited to build upon last year's momentum. This was driven by our highly engaged and talented team, and I would like to thank them for all their efforts fulfilling our critical role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter. Jason, I just wanted to understand the COVID-19 vaccines. Can you maybe just talk about the economics of that? Is that substantially better than kind of traditional drug distribution? And I know you said it only goes through October, but are there other vaccine opportunities that would be similar and incremental opportunities for Cardinal? Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks, Lisa. How I think about the vaccines is, again, we're not going to get into, obviously, product and customer level type of detail. But overall, it all comes down to the value that we provide. And so, when you think about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general, you really have to understand what's the requirements. And so with COVID and with some vaccines, it requires more complex distribution, cold chain capacity and capabilities. And of course, there's also - the unique thing about vaccines is that you scale up and down quickly and so you're spreading a lot of that cost over a pretty short period of time. So it's - there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to your question. And we provided a little bit of color for you in Aaron's comments there, so you can get a general understanding of the benefit that we had. And to go a little bit further, I can say that about one-third of the growth for the Pharma segment this quarter was related to vaccines. So it was a component of it, but certainly not the majority of the driver of the business. The core part of the business remained very strong within the segment for the quarter, and our guidance continues that core to continue to be strong. We do expect the vaccine benefit to be a bit greater in the second quarter because, of course, there's more volume in Q2 than in Q1, just given the nature of the October most likely being the peak volume that we would expect to see for vaccine distribution. And then we'd expect that to ramp down as we get the pipeline. We've got the pipeline pretty full here as we exited October. And now the future volumes will be much more predicated on what the actual demand is, which, of course, at this point in time is hard to anticipate. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : We'll now move to our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. A question on Medical, specifically the over-delivery this quarter or upside that you showed versus expectations. How much of that is core medical and mitigation efforts. What will carry through to the future versus not? And then were there any one-time items in Q1 we should keep an eye on? Any update on factors driving Q2 to Q4, including the incremental oil price and commodity pressure over the last few months? Aaron Alt : Eric, good morning. It's Aaron. Look, we were really pleased to see Q1 results slightly exceeding our external or rather our expectations. The results of the team doing what they had planned to do as well as being good managers and always looking for optimization opportunities across the portfolio, and so they did what they were expected to on the first part - or first part of the year for the medical improvement plan, and there were no notable one-time items contrary to some earlier quarters that complicated the results. So we were quite pleased with the results that we gave. And we do expect that to continue. You will have noted from our guidance for the year that we do expect slight continued improvement quarter-over-quarter. We are not changing our guidance for the year on medical. I want to emphasize that we've taken a balanced approach and believe that the $400 million profit number for the year is the right target and the right guidance for that business. And the plans also haven't changed, right? It's going to start with the continued execution of the Medical Improvement Plan and inflation mitigation elements that we've been talking about. Jason highlighted that we had hit 70% plus in the quarter as well, and they're going to continue to optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand We're continuing to focus on driving more out of at home and the other growth businesses as well as simplification and cost optimization and so overall, a great quarter and good expectations for the year to come. Jason Hollar : Yes. The other thing I'd add, Eric, I think the component of your question was just asking about commodities, and there's any impact there. There was not anything significant. So I know we've all been on this long journey as it relates to the impacts of commodities. So let me just spend a moment on that. As I think about the commodity and just general inflation, let me answer the question that way. I'd put our work into a couple of key buckets. The international freight piece is the only component that we've seen a meaningful change. And of course, that started about a year ago, and it was a dramatic reduction. So that reduction is as expected and given the elongated supply chain we had at that time, it took some time for that to work through and hit our P&L, but we're now seeing the more significant benefits of that over the last couple of quarters. So that is certainly a key component of it. What I would say about all the other commodities or all the other inflation, specifically the commodity impacts, whether it's the oil-based products polypropylene, polyethylene or unwovens and other types of inputs, which are varied. I would say that they are generally remain elevated a little bit volatile here and there, but generally elevated and not real different than what we had anticipated. So certainly noise, but how I think about it going forward and what my anticipation is we're just not seeing the volatility that we did back 18 months ago. So there is volatility, no doubt. There will always be volatility, but it's to a much lesser degree and much more balanced and kind of in a normal environment right now. And that's why you don't hear us talking about it is because it's just not meaningful in the context of everything else that we have going on. Operator : Next question from Kevin Caliendo, UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks. I guess, what we're trying to figure out is in the change in the pharma guidance, how much of it was incrementally coming from the vaccine incremental versus what you had originally expected if you don't want to give us that number specifically, maybe explain there was a 5 basis point improvement in the pharma margin year-over-year. How much of that was coming from vaccines? Or maybe you can just break out where the benefits came from. I assume GLP-1s were negative on the margin. So something had to be better on a year-over-year basis. I'd love to explore that? Aaron Alt : We're happy to provide a little more context. Look, it was a strong start to the year, and we remain very encouraged about the runway for the pharma business. And we did raise the guidance to 7% to 9%. It's really a result of three factors. First was just the strong Q1. And as Jason alluded to, we did have a contribution from the COVID vaccine distribution. And it was higher - that contribution was higher than what we had assumed in our original plans, just based on the timing of when the approvals came through. And frankly, our team's ability to jump on it and execute the way they did. Third element, though, was just the ongoing strength of the business under - other than the COVID vaccines, which is really consistent from an outlook perspective with the 4% to 6% guidance that we gave previously on a normalized basis. And just to remind you on that, what we had guided previously is that we expected low single-digit growth - profit growth from the core pharma business. We're expecting stability from the generics business, consistent market dynamics you often hear us say. We are expecting double-digit growth in the Specialty and Nuclear business, and Jason highlighted that progress in his comments earlier. And importantly, we are expecting brand inflation more in line with fiscal 2022, not the modest benefit that we saw in fiscal 2023, right? So look, we are early in the year. As we have done, we'll continue to update as we push ahead, but we're pleased with the results so far and the raise to the guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Hi. Thanks. Another question on the pharma business. You mentioned the consistent generics environment, but can you elaborate on that a little bit? I guess, can you speak to the generic drug pricing environment? Are you seeing any easing deflationary dynamics across generics? And how material is that for you in terms of your guidance raise across that segment? And does consistent mean essentially a continuation of those favorable pricing trends going forward I guess, throughout the rest of the year? Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks, Erin. It's very consistent to the prior messages. So we're not seeing any change in the underlying market. And so my comments are going to be very similar to what it's been in the past. So let me just start with just underlying utilization continues to be strong. We've seen - in our commentary this morning, we made a number of comments around just the broad-based utilization being strong in the pharma industry. So we generally benefited from that. So volume is absolutely a key component of that. The consistent market dynamics that Aaron just referenced again is an indication that the buy and sell side continues to be very balanced. So overall, as in the past, I'm not going to break apart all the different pieces. We think it's best to look at them on a net basis. And within that, what I will say, though, is we continue to have very strong performance with our Red Oak Sourcing joint venture. So we continue to have that team, very focused on the dual mandate of, of course, driving down the best cost. But also as important and their mandate is to ensure that service levels are optimized as much as possible as well. So we feel very good about their progress, both in controlling costs, but also in driving great service for our customers. So again, those should be very similar words what we've said in the past. So that's why we used the phrase consistent market dynamics because we're not seeing any significant change in the underlying dynamics of this part of our business. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. George Hill : Good morning guys. And thanks for taking the question. I think like a lot of the other people on the line here, I'm really intrigued by what seems to be going on in the generic drug business. You guys called out Red Oak, GLP-1s were really strong in the quarter, but they have to be significantly margin dilutive. I guess, Jason, I'd love if you could talk about like if anything is changing on the contracting side? Are you seeing like increased rebates for purchasing compliance or supply compliance? Just kind of interesting, any more color that you can provide on what's going on in the generic drug space as it relates to profitability would be super helpful. Jason Hollar : Yes, so it's a fair question, George. And there's always going to be an evolution customer to customer, contract to contract. The balance of brand versus generic and then within brand and within generic, the mix always is ever evolving. And so over time, I would expect there to be more and more separation between some of these elements as the weighting of the products change. So it's - even though this volume has been dramatic for the GLP-1s, it's also been over a pretty short period of time and probably still early in this journey. So you used the phrase, and I think it was used earlier is significantly margin dilutive. I'm not sure - I'm sure we've never said words like that because it's very rare you hear us talking about margin rates, which you hear us talking about is margin dollars, and I even joked about this at Investor Day. I'm not sure I've ever said the words out loud in my career about the margin rate not being the most important or a significant metric for us. And it's because of products like the GLP-1s, products that are incredibly important to that underlying patient, which means it's important to our customers, which means it's important to us. It is not the most profitable class of progress today, but it's important for our patients and important for the industry what we value more than anything else is innovation in the distribution channel in the industry. Innovation brings good things for us. Maybe not in the short-term and maybe not for every single product, but innovation ultimately brings opportunities, whether it's services or whether it's - when these products become other opportunities to contract or other opportunities over time for them to go generic, there's just lots of different ways in which you can create economic value on a particular transaction, particular product. And so GLP-1s, today, you don\u2019t hear us talk about from revenue, it's not a meaningful contributor to our earnings. And so we're not going to talk about it from an earnings perspective. Contracting back to your original question, we'll continue to evolve underneath that dynamic. But ultimately, we are well-protected customer by customer in certain corridors to ensure that we don't flip upside down on a particular customer. And so that needs to evolve over time as those concentrations evolve over time. But our model has proven very, very resilient over the years and decades because this is the latest mix challenge that there is or mix change, I should say. But it's not the first time that there's been a mix change in our industry. And so our model has proven to be resilient in that regard. So it's unique and different products, but it's not unique in terms of impacts and influences that a particular product category has on the pharma distribution industry. Operator : The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions or the comments about the pacing of the year. One thing that was just kind of - I heard what you said about calling out the inflation and how that doesn't quite flow through the same way as it did last year. Can you speak to how you're thinking about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year? Because I would say you had a\u2026 Operator : Sorry, if I think we lost the previous caller, and we'll move on to the next question from Daniel Grosslight from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we'll go back to the COVID vaccine for a second here. You mentioned that you're seeing talking of vaccine ahead of the season, the winter season. Are you also taking more share in vaccine distribution and perhaps your overall market share would suggest. And then as we think about therapeutics moving into the commercial channel in a couple of months here, how is that factored into your guidance? And then lastly, you've been operating well above your longer-term pharma EBIT guidance of 4% to 6% for a few quarters here. I'm curious if there's been any change to how you're thinking longer term about the business and some of the secular tailwinds that might be driving growth higher than your longer-term 4% to 6% guidance. Jason Hollar : You're getting all the value out of your one question. So let me see if I can touch on each one. I think there's some connectivity between these. So overall, for vaccines, I think the best way to think about vaccine distribution is more about it from the customer standpoint. So I think what you'll see is that COVID-19 vaccines like other vaccines typically will follow the distribution network. So the real question is, are our customers getting more than their fair share, and I don't necessarily want to talk about them from that perspective other than to say we are very happy with the customers we have. We've often used a phrase for other situations winning with the winners, and we feel very well aligned with great customers. And so - but I think that's how you should think about it. And that it most likely the vast majority of the volume will follow the distribution network. I think your second element of that question was on the COVID therapeutics. How I think about that is a little bit differently than vaccines in terms of just the rollout, where the vaccines were a bit of an obsolete old product, new product type of situation where all that government stockpile. When we were asked about vaccines nearly a year ago, when it was first communicated to be commercialized, that was part of our response as well. We didn't know the FDA approval date. We also didn't know what was going to happen with the in-stock inventory, which seems to not have been a relevant usage at this stage given the variance evolution. As it relates to therapeutics, you don't have that same challenge, right? There's a lot of product out there still and the rollout will be slower. And you're talking about an oral solid type of brand product, which typically does not carry very - the same type of specialization necessary in the distribution channel that does drive higher-margin products like our specialty products. And then the last question is on the long-term growth outlook. I think one of the key messages that is behind your question and behind how we think about it. And partly why we're calling out those elements that may be a little unusual. Again, just like with GLP-1s COVID vaccines, and other form of innovation. We like innovation. It provides us new opportunities and new growth as an enterprise. And so part of the answer to this question is, well, how do these innovative products evolve and transition over time? Is that a continued opportunity. Is it lumpy? Is this year may be higher or lower than what that volume will be in the future? That - those are all hard questions to answer. But what we saw here is a bit of an influx of innovation that we've been able to benefit from while using the same infrastructure. So one thing that's really important to highlight about our performance this quarter, so we had really nice gross margin growth and we had very flat SG&A. I made the comment about the operating leverage in my comments. That's what I'm getting at is that we were able to execute very efficiently this quarter and whether we're talking about vaccines or other products, having that gross margin because it's an incremental product category for us because, of course, we do not participate in that volume last year but we're able to leverage the same capacity, the same team, that's an efficient use of our distribution channel. And as we get more opportunities like that, then there's some opportunity. But one of the key things that Aaron highlighted in a number of his comments, whether it's his comments, whether it's his comments or his answers to the question, is that our underlying growth and we feel very good about that long-term target. And a lot of what we've seen here was the Q1 overperformance both from vaccines, but also just the core utilization being very strong. That's not the same level of strength that we have indicated, we should be thinking about long-term. It's an opportunity for us, but that's not what we're expecting at this point in time. And it's not what we're guiding for the balance of the year in terms of the core growth. We expect that core growth to still be in that 4% to 6% range. But again, innovation can create some opportunities for us. That's hard to see right now, but we're not planning for that. Aaron Alt : So maybe if I can just wrap a bow around that from a guidance perspective, just to reiterate what our guidance is look for the - as we sit here today, the Medical segment guidance is $400 million of profit for this year, and we've talked about that extensively, leading to $650 million of profit in fiscal year 2026. While we are pleased with the progress on Pharma, one quarter into the year and are raising our guidance for this year for Pharma, the 7% to 9% profit growth. Our longer-term algorithm remains the 4% to 6% profit growth that we had called out at our Investor Day, leading to 12% to 14% adjusted EPS growth long-term as our overall guidance. We're not seeing changes to our long-term guidance as we sit here today. Now some may ask, and I've seen in some of the headlines well, you beat by a particular amount, but your raise is a little bit less than what that amount is. And the short answer to maybe get ahead of the question is that we had above-the-line benefits for which we and below-the-line benefits relative to consensus or expectations. And the real difference between our raise and how you might do that math is just we're not carrying forward the tax benefit that we saw in Q1 into the updated guidance for reasons I called out during my prepared remarks. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on commodity prices. And you said that you're seeing less volatility in pricing than before. Would you say that when you look at sort of the increase in oil over the past six months or so, is that - would you say that's within the - your expectations of volatility? And - or would you might expect to see that get reflected into freight and/or some of your other input costs at some point? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes. No, that's a great question. And it's - so when I step back and think about 18 months ago, what the root issue was, of course, we had international freight that was driving up the cost of everything in a multiple that was crazy, but you also had these other commodities that were - okay, so there are some commodities that are oil-based, so the oil input costs, but then you had the supply-demand factors going on too that I think overemphasized that issue because we don't buy oil, we buy products that contain oil. And so as oil goes up and down, that's often absorbed within the supply chain in a normal steady state, unless it gets outside of a certain band. So it did get outside that band, right? Oil went above $100 per barrel. And then you had other demand factors that were driving those commodity costs well beyond what the input cost impacts were. So you had a bit of an exponential increase in a number of commodities. So today, given that we're in a much more muted demand environment, as a broad industry because this is way outside of healthcare, right? This is a general economy not being as hot as it was at that point in time. When you see these types of input costs going up and down, it goes back to a bit more of a normal model, which is they're not being exaggerated and multiplied, they're just flowing through in a much more normalized steady state. So that's the reason why that I would not expect this under this current environment to get outside of normal bounds. So if you see the input costs going up and you see a heated economic environment that can further compound that impact, that's when we need to start worrying more about this. I know the importance of this will certainly be - day-to-day, we certainly spend a lot of time on this, but we'll continue to provide any insight that we see going forward. Of course, when we get into the very significant changes, that's the changes to our contracting structure that we've put into place. That's never going to be perfect. It's never going to be a one-for-one offset, but it's meant to really be active and impactful when you have those more extraordinary types of impacts that really kind of compound these items like I just referenced, and not just the normal types of more muted movements. Charles Rhyee : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I want to go after the Pharma margin dynamic a little bit differently. So they were up 5 bps year-over-year. It sounds like the vaccine benefit is going to peak in your fiscal 2Q. So is the right way to think about the margin growth in the Pharma segment year-over-year is it could peak or the growth could peak in 2Q and then kind of more of a normalized lower margin trajectory in the back half? Just trying to get a sense of the seasonality there? Thanks. Jason Hollar : We really haven't provided quarterly guidance at the margin level for the pharma business. We were - we leaned in a bit in describing the impact to Q1 from the COVID vaccine distribution as well as Jason's comments around the expectations for Q2. Beyond that, I think you just need to take into account what we typically say about our business, which is, first, that we expect the consistent market dynamics from a generic perspective, right? And we are not assuming some of the benefits from a brand perspective in Q3 that we have previously seen. And that's how we are offering up today. Operator : We will now take our final question today from Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Apologies about the audio issues before. My question was just on the non-operating items, it seems like both on interest expense and maybe on the share count, based on the ASR that you talked about and the interest expense in the first quarter, that there's a little bit of conservatism in that number in those - both of those numbers Operator : And it seems we have lost\u2026 Aaron Alt : I'll answer the question. I think she was seeking to ask. The question from what I heard was interest and other, are we being conservative as well on what's going on with our share count? And I guess I would offer the following. We were pleased to see continued benefit in the quarter from I&O, driven by the fact that we have such high cash balances and the return we're receiving on those cash balances. We are, of course, also benefiting in the quarter from the fact that we are largely fixed rates. We have been now for several quarters. And so we haven't been exposed to the interest rate increases that some other companies may be dealing with, and that's just driven by the good stewardship previously. We do have a maturity coming at the end of fiscal 2024. It's about $750 million or so from recollection. And we've commented that we're likely to refinance that. I haven't commented on the timing of that as we care forward. And so we believe the guide - the updated guide we provided on I&O reflects the benefits and the various trade-offs in that. With respect to the share count, I do think it's important to call out that as we have consistently said, we don't guide for share count changes beyond the baseline share repurchase. We made a commitment at this during our Investor Day in June that our baseline share repurchase was going to be $500 million during fiscal year 2024. We completed that in the first quarter. That is the share repurchase we're talking about today, and our guide reflects the impact of that - of the completion of that share repurchase program. It does not reflect any other changes to share repurchase over the course of the year. As Jason called out earlier, we have the benefit of our cash balance. And having invested, having the plans that we do to invest in the business, CapEx-wise, $92 million in the first quarter, targeting $500 million for the year, and continue to make progress on our investment grade rating and the two outlook changes - positive outlook changes that we received during the quarter, having made our baseline share repurchase during Q1 as well as continuing to pay our dividend. As we are, as a dividend aristocrat and now we have the opportunity and support of the plans to take the resources we have available to us to invest back in the business with that specialty focus that Jason has called out several times to look at M&A in a disciplined manner, as Jason called out, and then to also consider further opportunistic share repurchase in due time as we assess how the year is performing. I think that's where Elizabeth was going. Operator : Thank you. With this, we conclude today's question-and-answer session. And now I'd like to hand the call back over to Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks. Over to you, sir. Jason Hollar : Yes. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us this morning. As we've said a few times, it was a great start to the year. We're pleased with our broad-based performance and to be in the position that we are today to raise our guidance after just the first quarter. We look forward to, certainly, continuing to update you on our progress against these plans throughout the year. And with that, thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Sims, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Sims : Welcome to this morning\u2019s Cardinal Health second quarter fiscal \u201824 earnings conference call and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health CEO Jason Hollar; and our CFO Aaron Alt. You can find this morning\u2019s press release and investor presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Before I turn the call over to Jason since we will be making forward-looking statements today. Let me remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, the comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, and once they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the supporting schedules attached to our press release. For the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we kindly ask that you limit questions to one for participants, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Good morning, everyone. In the last few weeks, we've made several notable announcements regarding our company's continued progress, including yesterday's news on our agreement to acquire specialty networks, which will further our specialty growth strategy and create value for specialty providers, manufacturers, and patients in exciting new ways. And as we highlighted at a recent industry conference, we're continuing to take actions to become a simplified and more focused company with further progress achieved on our ongoing business and portfolio review and our updated enterprise operating and segment reporting structure, which will be reflected in our financial reporting beginning next quarter. We plan to go further into our recent updates with you today, but first, let me begin with a few brief comments on our results. In Q2, we delivered strong profit growth in both segments, demonstrating continued operating momentum and execution against our strategic priorities. Pharma again delivered strong performance. Overall, the business is performing consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased to reiterate our outlook for 7% to 9% segment profit growth in fiscal \u201824. We've seen ongoing stability in macro trends, including in our generic program, and continued broad-based strength in overall pharmaceutical demand. Our specialty distribution business also continued to see strong demand, including with COVID-19 vaccines in the first part of the quarter. Turning to medical, Q2 segment profit was consistent with Q1, despite the non-recurring adjustments in the second quarter, which we've reflected in our updated fiscal \u201824 outlook for the former medical segment. We're encouraged by the underlying improvements in operating performance, reflecting further progress with our medical improvement plan efforts, focused on our global medical products and distribution business. Notably, we saw a change in trend in revenue growth for the medical segment in the second quarter. Along with continued growth from at-Home Solutions, we're seeing the effects of our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes yield positive results. And as we continue to optimize not only the performance of our businesses, but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we're generating robust cashflow and seeing meaningful benefits below the operating line. As a result of our first-half performance and increased confidence as we look ahead, we're pleased to raise our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance and our outlook for adjusted free cashflow. Of course, our customers remain at the center of everything we do, and our team continues to prioritize core operational execution to best serve them and their patients with essential products and services as we drive our company forward. Now let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail. Aaron Alt : Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Before we begin let me remind you that our Q2 segment commentary will be according to our former segment structure pharma and medical. Let's start with total company results for the second quarter. Q2 delivered another strong quarter across the enterprise with EPS of $1.82, growth of 38%, which included operating earnings growth of 20%. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash, even following incremental share repurchase activity in the quarter. As seen on slide four, total company revenue increased 12% to $57.4 billion, reflecting growth in both the pharma and medical segments. We drove operating leverage for the enterprise despite incremental investments in the business and higher costs to support sales growth. Gross margin increased 11% to $1.8 billion, driven by both segments, and consolidated SG&A increased 8% to $1.3 billion. With the strong profit growth in both segments, we deliver operating earnings of $562 million, 20% higher than a year ago. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $26 million to $8 million in income due to increased interest income on cash and equivalents from higher cash balances and higher rates. As we've noted, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near-term. Additionally Q2 interest and other benefited from nearly $10 million in income from the quarterly revaluation of our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which as a reminder has a matching offset above the line. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 21.3% was 1.7 percentage points lower than a year ago and better than we anticipated due to positive discrete items in the period. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were $246 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases in each of the last four quarters. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q2 was EPS of $1.82, reflecting growth of 38%. Let's turn to the pharma segment on slide five. Second quarter revenue increased 12% to $53.5 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health, and generics, and from our largest customers. We also continue to see robust demand for GLP-1 medications, which provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $518 million in the second quarter, driven by positive generics program performance and the higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our positive generics program performance continue to reflect volume growth and consistent market dynamics. With respect to COVID-19 vaccines, we saw the strength and demand from September for the fall immunization season carry into October before peaking mid-month and trending to a much lower run rate as we exited the second quarter. The Q2 increase in segment profit includes a partial offset from higher costs to support sales growth driven by increased pharmaceutical volumes. Turning to the medical segment on slide six. Second quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.9 billion, which as Jason alluded to, reflects quarterly revenue growth for the medical segment for the first time in over two years. This increase was driven by growth in both at-Home Solutions and global medical products and distribution, with the GMPD growth primarily related to higher Cardinal Health brand volumes. Medical delivered segment profit of $71 million, a $54 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. Consistent with the expectations communicated a few weeks ago, segment profit was generally consistent with Q1, despite some non-recurring adjustments in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying performance of the business, which through the first two quarters of the year has tracked consistent with our original plans. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion in Q2, bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $2 billion. And as I noted earlier, end of the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would, deploying capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Thus far, through the first-half of fiscal \u201824, we've continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing back into the businesses to drive organic growth with over $200 million in year-to-date CapEx. In the first-half, we have returned $1 billion total to shareholders, which includes our quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in year-to-date share repurchases. These share repurchases are in excess of our committed baseline repurchases of $500 million. And in January, we made certain opioid settlement prepayments of $238 million at a pre-negotiated discount, which is expected to result in a [gap] (ph) only gain of approximately $100 million in the third quarter. Now for our updated fiscal \u201824 guidance on slide eight, beginning with the enterprise. With our strong first-half performance and positive outlook, we are again raising our fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.20 to $7.35 reflects a $0.45 increase at the bottom end and a $0.35 cent increase at the top end from our Q1 guidance range. And a midpoint which is 26% above our fiscal \u201823 EPS results. We are encouraged by the operating performance of our businesses and our strong cash regeneration, which is certainly contributing to the improvements below the line. Interest in other is reduced to a range of $50 million to $65 million, which primarily reflects increased interest income from higher than anticipated cash balances. We expect lower average cash balances in the second-half of the year due in part to the seasonal timing of anticipated cash flows. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance our upcoming 2024 debt maturities in the back half of the year. We are lowering the top end of our effective tax rate guidance to a new range of 23% to 24% to reflect the positive discrete items we've seen in the first-half of the year. We also are lowering our shares outlook to approximately $247 million, which reflects the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program we completed in Q2. No additional share repurchases are assumed in our updated guidance for fiscal year \u201824. Now turning to the fiscal \u201824 outlook for our segments. While we will be transitioning to our new segment structure reporting beginning in Q3, let me start with our former segments as a comparison point for the updated structure. No changes to the outlook for the former pharma segment. We are reiterating the 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit growth. For the former medical segment, the fiscal \u201824 outlook is updated to approximately $380 million a segment profit to reflect the net impact of Q2 non-recurring adjustments. Outside of these, our overall operational expectations are consistent with delivering the prior $400 million in segment profit for the year, as well as the corresponding prior expectation of $650 million in segment profit for fiscal year \u201826. We have consistently highlighted the back half weighting of the medical guidance, driven by progress within GMPD on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation, and some business specific seasonality. Our expectations there continue. For example, with inflation mitigation, we have strong visibility to overall cost improvements in the second-half of the year, driven by reductions we've observed in international freight, which is a reminder reflecting our income statement on a two to three quarter delay and as we exit January the mitigation initiatives necessary to achieve our year-end target are now largely in place. Now as seen on slide 10, let me comment on how this fiscal year \u201824 guidance translates to our updated segment structure. To go along with the preliminary recast fiscal \u201823 actuals and long-term targets we provided a few weeks back. Our new structure went into effect January 1. So beginning in Q3, we will report results and provide drivers reporting to the new segment structure, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions and GMPD and separate from these two segments, nuclear at-Home, an OptiFreight aggregated in other. At that time, we also plan to provide a recast of the results for fiscal \u201822 to \u201824 on the new segmentation. Beginning with the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the guidance ranges are consistent with the former pharma segment, even excluding our higher growth nuclear business. We expect 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit outlook for fiscal \u201824 and a 4^ to 6% segment profit growth CAGR over the long-term. Turning to GMPD where we remain encouraged by the improvements in this business. For the execution of the medical improvement plan initiatives, we expect to drive GMPD from an operating loss of approximately $165 million in fiscal \u201823 to operating income of approximately $65 million in fiscal \u201824. From the fiscal \u201823 low point, this $230 million year-over-year improvement would position us roughly half way towards our fiscal \u201926 target of approximately $300 million for segment profit. Finally we expect the businesses including other, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics to collectively deliver 6% to 8% segment profit growth in fiscal year \u201824. The difference between this fiscal \u201824 growth rate and the long-term CAGR of 8% to 10% for fiscal \u201824 to \u201826 reflects the portion of the Q2 non-recurring adjustments within at-Home Solutions with the remainder residing in GMPD. Before I close a couple of comments on our recently announced acquisition. We've noted that the specialty category has been our highest priority for potential M&A and a primary consideration for our opportunistic capital employment as part of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our financial flexibility and strong presence in the other 60% of the specialty market in therapeutic areas outside of oncology, we have evaluated a range of potential acquisition candidates to further accelerate our specialty strategy. We are thrilled to reach an agreement for specialty networks to become a part of the Cardinal Health family. Jason will elaborate on the strategic aspects of the deal, but we plan to include the expected financial impacts of the transaction in our guidance upon closing, which of course is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. For general modeling purposes, we expect the deal to be accretive 12 months following close. So, to wrap up, tremendous progress in the first-half of the year with exciting value creation opportunities still in front of us. We are confident in our plans and grateful for the efforts of our team, who continue to drive our ongoing initiatives and prioritize the needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our strategic priorities beginning with priority number one and building upon the growth of pharma and specialty solutions, our largest and most significant business. Though this segment structure has slightly changed, our focus on executing in the core remains. We're building upon our strong foundation, while investing to accelerate growth in specialty both downstream and upstream. We believe that this new segment structure further enables those efforts by enhancing management focus, leveraging the connectivity between pharmaceutical distribution and specialty, and positioning the business for long-term growth and investment. More on that front shortly. A key component of our strong core foundation is our generics program anchored by Red Oak, which continues to do an excellent job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply. Red Oak leverages proprietary analytical tools and their deep industry expertise to help maximize service delivery for customers. We're continuing to invest in our business to provide customer-focused solutions and evolve our commercial engagement strategies to prioritize addressing the complex challenges our customers face every day. For example, at Investor Day, we highlighted our first-to-market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix platform. This innovative solution leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and generate actionable insights to simplify and streamline medication supply. We've continued to develop our offerings, such as the contract optimizer tool, which drives savings and value through contract compliance, cost controls, and product alternatives like brand generics, blood plasma, and more. Key health system customers are already benefiting from these capabilities, and we see opportunities for further future expansion. Shifting to specialty, where we have also been investing to expand our offering into complementary areas. The acquisition of specialty networks is exciting to us on a number of fronts. This is a business with which we were already very familiar, given the long-standing partnership to service their members through our specialty distribution. Specialty networks is a technology-enabled, multi-specialty group purchasing and practice enhancement organization serving 11,500 total providers today, including more than 7,000 physicians across 1,200 independent urology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology practices. We see their service capabilities as accelerating our efforts in critical ways. First, further extending our reach, expertise, and offerings in key therapeutic areas to provide increased clinical and economic value for specialty providers. Specialty networks is a leader in specialty practice management, research, and technologies that support physicians in lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and delivering best-in-class care to their patients. For example, the company provides solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes to over 3,000 urologists through its leading euro GPO. Second, creating a platform for our expansion across specialty therapeutic areas. The company's PPS analytics solution is a subscription-based advanced technology platform that utilizes artificial intelligence, such as continuous learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze data for electronic medical records, practice management, imaging and dispensing systems, and transform it into actionable insights for providers and other stakeholders. We see this complementing our suite of clinical practice management and distribution solutions to specialty practices nationwide. Specialty networks experience and capabilities and clinical engagement are robust, which also accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. Third, enhancing the capabilities of our specialty business, including supporting the ongoing build of the Navista network. Specialty networks have a deep understanding of independent physician practices, and we see capabilities and expertise that will accelerate our ongoing development of the Navista network, which is focused on supporting the clinical and operational needs of independent community oncologists. In summary, this transaction enhances our specialty strategy by providing new capabilities that strengthen the link between our downstream and upstream services, enabling us to create further value for customers, manufacturer partners, and patients. Turning to priority number two in the GMPD business, where we're executing the medical improvement plan. While the business and portfolio review of GMPD continues, the team continues to prioritize and make significant progress in turning around the operational performance of this business, as Aaron indicated, with our expectation that the business returns to profitability in fiscal 2024. The number one priority remains mitigating supply chain inflation, where we remain on track to address the impact by the time we exit fiscal \u201924. As of Q2 we're approximately 75% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated, and we have strong line of sight to continued improvement in the second-half of the fiscal year. We've continued to make progress with our mitigation initiatives and commercial contracting efforts and are continually taking additional actions to offset elevated inflation, such as through sourcing initiatives. As Aaron indicated, the work we've accomplished to-date provides increased confidence in achieving our fiscal year-end target as overall cost improvements continue to reflect in our second-half results. We're continuing to invest in the resiliency of our supply chain and our manufacturing and distribution capacity. We have opened three new distribution centers in the past year, adding capacity for growth, while featuring state-of-the-art automation technology to streamline operations. For example, our new Greater Toronto area DC expands capacity to serve Cardinal Health Canada customers, while leveraging autonomous mobile robots to increase picking and packing accuracy and drive efficiencies. We're also continuing to invest in new product innovation and portfolio expansion in key categories in alignment with our disciplined portfolio management approach. As a result of our team's collective efforts, we're seeing our five-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume result in improvements in our leading indicators and most importantly, strong customer retention and product volume growth. Finally, we continue to drive simplification and optimize our cost structure by exiting non-core product lines, rationalizing our network and streamlining our international footprint. We believe our new structure will further enable our medical improvement plan efforts as we continue to execute the plan and deliver value for customers. Now, priority number three, accelerating growth in key areas. We are excited about the strong demand we are seeing in our at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight businesses, and our recent determination to further invest in and develop these businesses for long-term value creation as part of our portfolio. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. To support the growing demand for home health care, we're investing to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and a new technology to drive operating efficiencies. We recently announced plans for a new distribution center to be built in Texas with increased capacity, advanced automation technology, and robotics within the facility. And our previously announced 350,000 square foot facility being built in South Carolina is on track to open this calendar year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we're continuing to invest in digital tools to enable healthcare supply chain leaders to better manage their shipping spend and support the core volume growth in our business. We've launched new offerings to give our customers more supply chain visibility, and we are receiving great feedback. For example, we now have more than 1,000 healthcare providers leveraging our total view insights platform to gain valuable insights on their operations. In nuclear and precision health solutions, we're continuing to see above market growth in both our core business and Theranostics, as we're a premier partner of choice due to our strong core foundation and differentiation with pharmaceutical manufacturers looking for commercialization success of their future radiopharmaceutical portfolios. For example, in Theranostics prostate cancer radio diagnostics are important tools for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We saw meaningful year-over-year revenue growth in the first-half of fiscal \u201824 from the ramp up in demand of these diagnostics. From a pipeline perspective, we're investing to expand our Center for Theranostics Advancement with demand from pharmaceutical manufacturer partners currently oversubscribed. And we're investing to expand the capabilities and resiliency of our pet manufacturing network to enable portfolio diversification and accommodate growth from the increasing demand for pet agents. This is driven by trends such as an aging population, cancer prevalence, emerging Alzheimer's therapy, availability and reimbursement and increasing clinical trial needs. Finally, priority number four, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're continuing to maximize shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow, and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron noted, our robust cash flow generation is not only driving benefits below the operating line, it is enabling our opportunistic capital deployment with additional share repurchases in the quarter beyond our baseline plan and our ability to pursue value-creating M&A in specialty. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue opportunistically evaluating disciplined M&A not only in specialty, but in our other growth areas and potential additional share repurchases. With our recent conclusions on our business portfolio review, we do not have further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. To close, we had a strong first-half of the year and are excited about the many initiatives underway to build upon our momentum. I would like to thank our highly engaged and talented team for driving our progress and prioritizing our customers as we fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Stephanie Davis, calling from Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the continued progress. Jason you already shared a lot of color around the acquisition, but I was hoping you could dig in just a little bit further on specialty networks' mix and capabilities, just given the higher margin nature of both GPO and analytics solutions? And then just following up, given the pipeline that you mentioned, I was hoping you could share some thoughts on hurdle rates for future deals as that becomes a bigger part of the story? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning, Stephanie. Yes, we're really excited about specialty networks. And as I -- I love how you asked the question, Stephanie, because there's a lot that goes into this business, and we love all of it, whether it's the GPO or the analytics and technology behind it. Specifically, PPS analytics is something we thought was really special, not just in terms of how this team has created this capability for their original primary business of urology, but then how they've expanded it into other therapeutic areas, and we felt we could learn from that further and use that technology across potentially other therapeutic areas beyond the three that they're in today. So that was really exciting to us and certainly a key part of the value. So we definitely attributed good value to that technology and where we believe that can go. And not only that good for our business, but importantly we see that technology is really solving a lot of customer both provider and manufacturer challenges and ultimately giving a much better solutions to the end-patient. So it's a win-win across the industry and one that plugs in nicely to our strategy and to be throughout the specialty space. So we feel great about that and I certainly don't want to miss that we are also through this transaction acquiring a fantastic leadership team that will plug in very nicely to our own existing team. And so it's a culture that I think will work very well together. We've had a fantastic, very quick process. We've known specialty networks for quite a while, but from the point that we started talking about a possible tie up, we went from the beginning to the end of course doing a deep and thorough diligence, but nonetheless knowing the business well, so that we could quickly understand the value for us. As it relates to your second question on hurdle rates, I'm not sure exactly which part of the business you're referring to. But generally speaking, I think no matter what part of our business we're talking about it's a competitive, it's stable type of environment and so I'm not normally going to go deeper into that anyways, but generally you know speaking we're not really calling out anything from the overall market perspective today regardless of what our business we're talking about utilization continues to be quite good and predictable so we're in a nice environment for ongoing growth both organically, as well as enable to look optimistically at transactions like this. Aaron Alt : Probably worth noting that it is a profitable business today and as Jason highlighted we do intend to invest in the business early on to expand the scope of what they are doing across not only their own initiatives, but our initiatives within specialty as well. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen our next question is going to be coming from Lisa Gill calling from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much for taking my question and good morning. Just really wanted to ask two things, Jason. One, on the strategic side as we think about your core medical business. One, do you still feel a commitment to that business going forward? And then secondly, as we think about the shift and the new reporting structure, it does look like you're taking down the margin on the core business. Is there something that's either changing in the timeline of the turnaround? Is there something else that's shifting competitively or incremental cost? If you could just help us to understand that? Thanks so much. Jason Hollar : Sure, Lisa. Very clear here. No, there's no change in our commitment to this business. It has been there from the very beginning and continues to be. As I highlighted from the first moment when we talked about medical in the context of the business portfolio review, our number one priority has always been and continues to be turning the business around. Everything that we are working on has been in service of, first of all, the five-point plan to drive Cardinal Health plan volumes to mitigate inflation and drive additional value through simplification and cost reductions. That message and the progress we made is entirely consistent with that. The core operational performance of the business is exactly how we've laid it out. So the only update that we've had today were in recognition of some of those non-recurring items, but the plan and the fiscal year \u201826 aggregate targets that we're going after are absolutely unchanged to this resegmentation. We did have to bucket the medical improvement plan into the various buckets, because we did have the growth businesses that were a component of that. But that was just moving the pieces. The pieces are absolutely unchanged and the overall aggregate profitability in that long-term plan is absolutely unchanged and our commitment is absolutely unchanged to this business. And I'm really excited about the progress that the team is making in service of all those goals. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you very much sir. And our next question will be coming from Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I have two sort of maybe more financial questions going forward. Can you talk us sort of the interest expense. Obviously they had a pretty big step down. Just wanted to understand that in terms of that and your sort of ongoing thoughts on the capital structure? And can you also talk about the free cash flow improvement, that was nice to see that step up in the quarter as well in terms of the guidance? Aaron Alt : We're happy to offer some perspective. We're quite pleased with the below the line results of course you know for the quarter. I'm going to start with the fact that as we announced we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand and of course that's driven by the strong cash generation, which was the end part of your question. If you think back to our investor day we had highlighted that further optimization of our cash flow position was something we were focused on doing and the team has delivered against those efforts internally and generated strong cash flow in the first-half for the business thus the balance. Of course the knock-on consequence of that is when we have more cash on hand particularly in the higher interest rate environment, which we've been operating, we'll get a higher return, right? And we have indeed benefited from greater rate of return on the larger cash balances that we've had in place. It's also the case that there is some geography within our statement, because deferred comp was a positive for us below the line. That's an offsetting negative above the line in the quarter as well. And so, it's really the aggregation of those three things, of those several things which led to the results for the quarter. Now you asked about the financing as well. And I should be clear on a couple of things just as we think about our models going forward. We do have maturities coming in June and November. We\u2019re assessing when our opportunities are there, nothing to announce today in that respect that we will address that, you know, at some point as we carry forward. And there is also the case that our cash balances fluctuate seasonally in the back half as well and so we wouldn\u2019t expect the high balance to remain where it is just given the seasonal demand on the business. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. On the medical side, it\u2019s hard to see through the one-time items. I want to ask what you can give us on the nature of those one-time items? What the trajectory looked like excluding one-timers in the quarter? And any views on the exit trajectory for the year and kind of going from $140 million first-half to $240 million second-half how you're pacing relative to that? Aaron Alt : Thank you. We were really encouraged by the underlying performance in Q2 of the medical business. And just to restate the results, the Q2 results were consistent with the expectations we communicated several weeks ago at the JPMorgan Conference and generally consistent with Q1, despite some of those adjustments that we took in the quarter. I want to emphasize that as you move away from the adjustments that we took, the underlying elements of the Medical Improvement Plan, they are on track, right? You heard some of my preferred remarks relative to our progress against the mitigation of inflation and how our cost structure is building. The benefits of each actions we've taken will benefit our cost structure in the back half of the year. You heard us announce that we had revenue growth for the first time in two years in the quarter as well, and we were pleased with the Cardinal Health brand growth that comes with that. And the team continues to execute against the simplification initiatives that have been a core part of the medical improvement plan all along. So let me go back to where I started, which is we were quite pleased with the operational performance in the quarter. I also want to point out that from a guidance perspective, while we updated the guidance for the year to reflect the relative impact of the non-recurring adjustments, that was the sum change of the guidance, to reflect that which is behind us, not that which is ahead. And if you think through how we have guided medical for the year all along, there's always been a very back half focused trajectory for our guidance for the year and that remains unchanged along with how pleased we are with the core operational performance. Jason Hollar : Yeah, if I could just add, you know, when you think about that first-half, second-half things and why we still anticipate the same step up in the second-half versus the first-half. There's a couple of key points. First of all, inflation mitigation, this is one where it's a significant part of that combined with Cardinal Health brand volume growth, which I'll get to in a moment. But on the inflation mitigation, there's of course two elements. There's the cost side, and then there's a price side. In both cases we have very good line of sight. On the cost side as we've talked really for quite a while now it's been the international freight and that while we have a little bit of noise with the Red Sea it is largely as anticipated so and that cost is already on our balance sheet and is rolling through as expected, especially given our volumes have been as expected. So, we have a very high line of sight and confidence the cost is going to continue to step down in the second-half of the year. And then on the pricing side, as we talked before, there's always the contract roll-through that we then update the pricing on. We do have a little bit more at the beginning of the calendar year of some of the price adjustments. So January being behind us, we have a really good line of sight to the pricing side as well. So there's some time now for the next couple of quarters needed to get that to roll through our income statement. But the actions now are largely behind us as it relates to inflation mitigation. We've always had confidence we would get to this stage, but we're now at this stage and have even more confidence actually seeing it start to come through in the second-half of the year. Now the other component is the Cardinal Health brand volume. You know, part of that's going to be market-driven, and the market volume, that utilization continues to be quite good. And what was exciting about the second quarter is seeing that further inflection and actually participating in that market growth really for the first time at the extent that what the market is growing. So that gives us much greater confidence that we'll continue to see that growth and that stuff as we get over the course of the year. But there's some variables like the market itself that will always be an impact here, good or bad, that will continue to monitor and track. So that those are the key points that I get us from the first-half to the second-half. Aaron Alt : Eric, it's probably worth offering one additional point of perspective. We're not reporting on the new segment structure this structure that will follow on Q3, but we can offer the observation that the GMPD core part of the medical business has operated at near breakeven levels in the first-half of fiscal \u201824. And I offer you that in contrast with where they were from a fiscal \u201823 perspective and where we're going from an overall guidance perspective, we view that as a key sign of positive progress. Operator : Thank you very much, gentlemen. [Indiscernible]. Our next question is going to be coming from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. On the drug pricing front, you do continue to mention generics as a key driver. Are you still seeing that using deflationary dynamics that others have noted too? And how material is that for you and also how sustainable is it you know what are some of the key drivers that you're looking at there? And how are you thinking about that for the balance of the year, as well as we think about the quarterly cadence here for that that U.S. pharma or for the pharma segment particularly with the COVID dynamics too? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Appreciate the question. I think as we called out in commenting on the strong quarter that our pharma business had was that the continued consistent market dynamics within the generic space matched with volume, strong volume was a reason for -- one of the reasons for success in the business. We often talk about the two sides of the equation being in balance and indeed that's what we continue to see within our generic business and that is indeed a core component of our guidance for the pharma as we carry forward. One last reminder, I do want to remind that last quarter we actually took our pharma guidance up from a profit perspective to 7% to 9%. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Allen Lutz calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about growth of SG&A in the quarter? You flagged incremental investments in the business and higher selling costs. Can you unpack exactly what those expenses are? And then how should we think about SG&A growth for the remainder of the year? Thanks. Aaron Alt : Happy to offer some perspective. We were pleased in the quarter to actually achieve operating leverage with gross profit growing faster than SG&A. SG&A did grow, of course volume also grew, and so the primary component of our increase in cost was tied to the variable cost of serving higher volumes. It is also the case though that as Jason has highlighted in his strategic remarks, we are investing against our business and some of the SG&A growth was purposeful relative to the investments we're making in places like the Navista and other elements of our growth plans. But I will end with the fact that we are very focused on SG&A as a whole and the team continues to look for further opportunities as we have in prior years to optimize our cost structure. Operator : Thank you very much sir. We'll now move to Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Can you give us an update on the progress of the United contracts renewal timing, any updates you have there? And just to follow-up on that SG&A question, were there purposeful investments made when you saw sort of upside from interest in other things in SG&A in the quarter? I'm just trying to quantify how much was in the original plan versus maybe how much was incremental given some of the upside that you saw below the line? Jason Hollar : Yes, sure. I'll touch on both points here. There's no updates with the Optum contracted those through this fiscal year. And as I highlighted before, they are a great customer of ours, long-standing customer, one that brings a lot of innovation to healthcare, and one that we've worked very hard over the years to attempt to exceed their expectations, and we think we're doing a great job of that, and we'd love to keep working with them, of course. Now, I do get a lot of questions around the order of magnitude of this, and I'm not going to go into details, but just a couple of points, you know, given the number of questions I've received, is we have disclosed in the past, and I think it comes through in every K, just the order of magnitude, so last year they were over $30 billion customer of ours, and I see a lot of people attempting to try to model out impacts and things of that nature. And there's a couple things that I'm not sure is real clear about the scope of business we have with them today. It is a prime, the majority of the revenue we have with them is through our base PD business and a lot of that is mail order volume. So what you have here are the typical markers of a large customer, PD majority and mail order. So those are all, you know, markers of lower than average margin type of business and so we do have other business with them of course too. They are very large and have a lot of breadth into various parts of the industry, but for us those tend to be a little bit of the overweight of how we support them. As it relates to the SG&A, the only thing I would say is no it's not like that what we do is we look at the capabilities and the necessities needed both short-term and long-term. Short-term is going to be on volume and making sure we can support our customers in getting that strong volume growth across the enterprise and in place we are then looking to balance that with longer term investments whether it's the Navista network we've called out before as investments, but we also have others that we went through during investor day and have had a number of updates even today, within our at-Home business we have three new facilities that we're bringing online over the course of the next year or two within the medical distribution three facilities I talked about today, we have on the pharma side the consumer health new logistics center. So I also made some comments around some of the IT capabilities within pharma, some of the e-commerce and intralogics capability. So we are investing where it makes sense efficiently, very well aligned to our strategy. And these are non-investments that you can just turn on and off. So it's something that we're going to invest as appropriate, but only what we have to do as well. We want to take away waste and invest it where there's growth is the key objective. Aaron Alt : For those working on their models, it's probably worth pointing out that with respect to the Q2 profitability in the business, it was the case that last year we called out unusual strength in the overall farm of demand, particularly from large customers, as well as a very strong cough, cold and flu season, so as you're looking at your comparisons keep that in mind. Operator : Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll now move to Mr. George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, Jason and Aaron. And forgive me if I kind of missed this or if you guys talked through this already, but as it relates to the planned restatement of the other segment, it looks like the growth in the near-term is coming in, but termed kind of the long-term targets. I just kind of wonder if you could address kind of or disagree in which sub-segments you're seeing the softness relative to the long-term expectations for the balance of the year or this year versus what you think kind of accelerates coming out and kind of closes the gap in the longer-term guidance? Aaron Alt : The businesses that report through other for us going forward will be our at-Home business, our Nuclear Precision Health Business, and our OptiFreight business. Those are what we have traditionally called our growth businesses as part of other segments. And indeed over the long-term we expect them, the CAGR on their collective growth to be 8% to 10 percent. The disconnect you're referencing which is the 6% to 8% in fiscal \u201824 is only driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments from Q2 on the at-Home business that we referenced a couple of weeks ago as we talked about our expectations for Q2. Each of the businesses contribute to the revenue and profit growth for other. For instance, we carry forward in our earlier disclosures, I think you can get pretty close we disclosed the revenue of the individual pieces. And indeed, we've talked about nuclear, doubling its profit off of its fiscal \u201821 baseline by fiscal \u201826 as well. I believe and so you're able to get to that component of other through that. George Hill : Thanks. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. We'll now take a Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead sir. Stephen Baxter : Yes hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions, a couple of quick ones. On COVID vaccines and commercial channel, I think last quarter you kind of indicated or implied that the contribution was around $25 million. I was hoping you could update it on what the performance was this quarter and whether you factor anything into the balance of the year. And, and then just to try one more time on the non-recurring medical adjustment. Can you just tell us on the $20 million, if what does that actually represent in terms of the underlying accounting or business activity? Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes. So for the vaccine, we just kind of walk through the last couple of quarters and I'll give you a flavor of the benefits and the trends and such. So as we talked last quarter, we've highlighted in Q1 with the FDA approval at the beginning of September we were staged to hit the ground running and we had fairly significant volume in that first quarter, but as anticipated we indicated that point that we would expect it to peak within Q2 and so we expected higher volume, higher contribution in Q2 versus Q1 and that was because we saw October as the largest month within that season. And then as expected, we saw that wind down over the course of November and December, still seeing some level of volume in Q3, but I would expect it to be quite insignificant, compared to what we saw in Q1 and then Q2. Overall, I think the key message is that this is consistent with our expectations, as Aaron highlighted in his comments already. We had multiple drivers of growth for the pharma segment in the second quarter. It was strength with the generics program within brand. It was COVID driving that component and then we had these investments and primarily the cost to serve partial offset to those other two drivers. So overall, Phil feel good about the overall health of the business and the contribution of COVID within it. Aaron Alt : Yes with respect to the non-recurring adjustments. We previewed this back at the JP Morgan conference and when we updated our commentary around the medical business and our comment that -- is our coming out, which is and we have continued to dig deep across the portfolio, we've taken a decision to take some non-recurring adjustments, which the majority of which hit the at-Home business, which now reports or will report as part of other in Q3, as well as component hitting the wave mark business which is part of the new GMPD business. So if you read through the update to our guidance for the year where we moved from approximately 400 to approximately 380 driven by the impact of the non-recurring adjustments you can reach your own conclusions as to the relative quantification and the distribution given those comments. Thanks. Operator Thank you very much, sir. Our next question is coming Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen, please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Allen\u2019s question there on the vaccine impact. I understand your saying that it kind of, you expect it to peak in the December quarter. Would you say that the contribution, though, from vaccine was higher than in the first quarter given that you had still three months of overall and if we look at that relative to what you had expected the higher costs that you incurred? Did you use that to fund those kind of investments? Just wanted to get a sense on relative contribution? Jason Hollar : Yes, as I highlighted, October was the peak month and since we only had a partial September, it is clearly higher in Q2 than in Q1. We did have November and December contributions as well, but it really tailed off by the time we got to the end of the quarter and that's why you would expect there it be very little it was just typical for vaccines in general, so there's nothing we're seeing there. And again I think that the way you ask the question around the funding of investments I'll just go back to my prior answer to that question. There were costs associated with the vaccine rollout. As you can imagine, that's a lot of volume to ramp up for really two months-worth of support. Our team did a fantastic job working with the manufacturers and our customers to play that role when we were not involved in the vaccine distribution before for COVID. So I feel very good about our role and we did have to incur cost associated with the ramp up and ramp down in such a short period of time. But that was not necessarily used as currency to fund other programs, where the programs are important strategically and all very consistent with the plans and the actions and the forecast we\u2019ve laid out here, so there is no changes as it relates to how we are approaching these both short-term requirements, as well as long-term investments. Aaron Alt : Probably worth emphasizing that Jason\u2019s point is that September and October were the high points for COVID for us from a distribution perspective would we tailing off thereafter. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you very much, gentlemen. And our last question today will be coming from Mr. Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel Grosslight : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to just go back quickly to the medical profitability question and confirm one thing, that $20 million one-time item that was wholly kind of concentrated this quarter. So without that, the medical profitability would have been around $90 million. And then on your commentary around shipping rates coming down and benefiting you, and the volatility in Red Sea, if you look at the -- China to Westcoast shipping rates, they have spiked materially in January. So I\u2019m wondering how, I guess couple of thigs there; one how that may kind of roll through you contracts. And then given that you capitalize those costs and expenses over two to three quarters post those cost being capitalized. How that might impact the cadence of your medical improvement plan in fiscal \u201925? Thank you. Aaron Alt : So the first-half of that question, you are thinking about things correctly. I'll go back and emphasize we were really pleased with the operational performance of the business and given that we've adjusted our yearly guidance just to reflect the impact of the non-recurring adjustments in Q2, your conclusion on the math would be reasonable. Jason Hollar : Yes and the second component, you are correct that shipping rates have spiked. I think the word used was materially. And how I would characterize it is yes, that's accurate, but substantially less materially than where they were in the past. So the order of magnitude we're talking about is vastly smaller. It is also something that we do not believe that that will be the permanent level. Yes, we have more flexibility in our contracts, and that will continue to be a lever and a component that will be evaluating, determining on whether, you know, how permanent these are or not. I would also say that our maturity our capability within this space has substantially improved as well as we've invested in the underlying processes and procedures to manage through these types of this type of volatility. So you know overall we feel very good about where we stand and generally don't see this being as a material item, but we'll continue to watch it closely. Operator : Thank you very much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for the additional or closure remarks. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes, thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We're clearly excited about the momentum that we have in our business, both the shorter term operational elements that we talked a lot about today, but also about the longer term strategy with the announcement especially networks this week it just highlights that we are looking and acting both short-term and long-term and are really excited about the opportunity still in front of us. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Thank you so much sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference and thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect. Good day and goodbye.",

I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Matt Sims, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Sims : Welcome to this morning's Cardinal Health third quarter fiscal '24 earnings conference call, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health's CEO, Jason Hollar; and our CFO, Aaron Alt. You can find this morning's earnings press release and investor presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Since we will be making forward-looking statements today, let me remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, the comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the supporting schedules attached to our press release. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit questions to one per participant, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Good morning, everyone. A year ago at our Investor Day, I reflected upon what attracted me to Cardinal Health, our strong culture, values, and mission to be healthcare's most trusted partner; how the company was uniquely positioned with its breadth and scale to navigate the complexities of the healthcare ecosystem and serve the needs of customers, manufacturers and ultimately, patients. At the same time, I was open about some of the opportunities in front of us as an organization. Together, we laid out a clear but aggressive strategic plan, streamlined our focus, and the team got to work, all the time prioritizing on our core business to emerge as a stronger, more resilient company. And we have a recent proof-point. Over the last several months, we deeply focused on preparing for a variety of alternatives regarding a particular large, low margin customer contract, which has allowed us to quickly navigate the upcoming contract change and confirm that we expect to grow our earnings in fiscal '25. By driving improvements in our core operations, investing to expand our offerings in key areas like specialty and evolving our commercial approach in ways which have resonated elsewhere in the marketplace, we demonstrated that we have made progress on positioning our business for sustained success and growth. As we look ahead, the current quarter's results reinforce our confidence. We're operating from a position of growing strength and resiliency, with industry trends that remain stable and in our favor. In Q3, we delivered broad-based growth, while executing on our four strategic priorities; building upon the growth and resiliency of pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, executing our GMPD improvement plan, accelerating growth in key areas, and maintaining a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In our most significant business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we again drove solid profit growth on top of a difficult comparison to last year's strong performance. We've seen ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, consistent market dynamics in our generics program, and strong performance in specialty, both downstream and upstream, all of which enables us to raise our fiscal '24 profit outlook for the segment to a midpoint of 9% growth. In GMPD, we are pleased to see the strong topline and bottom line performance, with an acceleration in growth reflecting further progress against the business' turnaround plan. GMPD's quarter was overall consistent with our expectations and the team is already working hard on the continued ramp-up in Q4. Among our other operating businesses, our new reporting structure implemented at the start of Q3 is reinforcing our focus on performance and purposeful investment in growth. The strong demand we are seeing across Nuclear, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight, fueled by favorable industry trends, excites us about the long-term potential as these markets and businesses continue to develop. And as we've optimized the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we've seen meaningful benefits below the operating line this year. Putting it all together, we're pleased to be in a position to raise our fiscal '24 EPS outlook, provide preliminary guidance for fiscal '25 of profit growth in each of Pharma, GMPD, and Other, as well as overall EPS, and reiterate our long-term targets for our businesses and enterprise. Our strategy and long-term outlook are unaltered and our team remains focused on executing our plan as we serve our customers and continue to drive our company forward. With that, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our Q3 results, fiscal '24 guidance, and early fiscal '25 outlook in more detail. Aaron Alt : Thank you, Jason. This morning, we are reporting our financial results on the new financial reporting segment structure we implemented at the beginning of Q3. To that end, we released an 8-K on April 23, which provided the recast historical quarterly results for fiscal year '22, fiscal year '23, and fiscal year '24 through Q2, reflective of the new segmentation for Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, GMPD, and Other. As we called out at the time, the new segmentation is designed to provide greater transparency, focus, and accountability across our businesses, and we are already seeing those benefits. Overall, Q3 was a strong quarter with double-digit operating earnings growth and 20% EPS growth. We accomplished that growth, while at the same time leaning in and making significant investments of time, expense and capital against our longer-term strategic plan. With both continued confidence in our strategies and a resilient business and team, we are pleased to once again raise our EPS guidance for fiscal year '24, more on that shortly. As seen on Slide 4, total company revenue increased 9% to $55 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up Other. We were particularly pleased to see the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in GMPD at 4%. We are also pleased that gross margin increased 9% to $1.9 billion. While consolidated SG&A also increased just under 9% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, the increased amount reflects technology and other purposeful investments against the future of the business and higher costs to support sales growth. With strong broad-based profit growth, we delivered operating earnings of $666 million, 10% higher than last year. Moving below the line, interest and other was generally consistent with the prior year at $26 million, and our third quarter effective tax rate of 20.4% was better than we expected due to positive discrete items. As a result of our prior share repurchases, Q3 average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 5% lower than a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q3 was EPS of $2.08, reflecting growth of 20%. Now turning to the segments, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 9% to $50.7 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth. We continued to see strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. While we again saw robust demand for GLP-1 medications, recall that we had guided that the revenue growth rate would moderate this quarter, as it did, given the acceleration that we started to realize last year during Q3. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment's Q3 revenue growth would be 7%. As we previously noted, these sales did not meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 4% to $580 million in the third quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Our generics program continued to see both volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Within our brand and specialty products, demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the quarter was, consistent with our expectations, not a meaningful contributor. As anticipated and guided, lower branded inflation than last year's relative high point was a year-over-year drag on profit growth. So, overall, we were pleased to deliver 4% segment profit growth in Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, solid growth on top of an exceptionally strong quarter a year ago, which grew 23%. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 6. Revenue grew for the second quarter in a row by 4% in Q3 to $3.1 billion. This increase was driven by volume growth from existing customers. The GMPD segment delivered segment profit of $20 million, a $66 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. GMPD continued its strong turnaround trajectory, achieving its highest level of quarterly profitability in the last two and a half years. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying improvements in the business, driven by the team's efforts against the GMPD Improvement Plan. As a reminder, the components of the former Medical Improvement Plan are now split between GMPD and Other, and the plan continues to be on track. The team achieved notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter, and we again saw a year-over-year improvement and growth in Cardinal Health brand volumes, providing continued fuel for the business' ongoing turnaround. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into Other, as seen on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $1.2 billion due to growth across all three businesses, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. Collectively, the businesses grew segment profit in the quarter by 5%, with OptiFreight Logistics showing particular strength as we worked during the quarter to create the foundations for future profit growth in all of the businesses. Jason will further discuss our excitement around these businesses and some of the recent trends momentarily. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a strong cash position with $3.7 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow and have continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework, including investing approximately $320 million in CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth and funding the $1.2 billion acquisition of Specialty Networks. Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress with our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we received a further update to our ratings outlook with Moody's moving our outlook to positive. We issued $1.15 billion in new notes during the quarter to refinance our upcoming June and November debt maturities. We plan to hold the cash proceeds and time deposits until the calendar year 2024 maturities come due. I'll note, due to the nature of these contracts, only about half of the total cash received is reflected in our Q3 ending cash balance. The remaining $550 million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other on the balance sheet. We have returned over $1 billion total to shareholders year-to-date, which includes approximately $375 million of quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in share repurchases, which is in excess of our committed baseline repurchase of $500 million. Now for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 9, beginning with the enterprise. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal year '24 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.30 to $7.40 reflects a midpoint, which is 27% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. We started the year working to deliver our guidance of 14% EPS growth at the midpoint. What a year it has been so far. Before we turn to the segments, a few comments on our enterprise assumptions. With the year-to-date results, we are improving our fiscal '24 effective tax rate guidance to an updated range of 22% to 23%. And we are reiterating our fiscal '24 expectations for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion, for CapEx of around $500 million, for diluted shares of approximately 247 million, and for share repurchases of $750 million which, consistent with our framework, does not assume further repurchase activity this year. Now turning to the fiscal '24 outlook for our new segment reporting structure, as seen on Slide 10. With another solid quarter from Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we are raising and narrowing our segment profit guidance for the full year to 8.5% to 9.5% growth, which at the midpoint implies continued mid-single digit profit growth in the fourth quarter. We are reiterating our guide for GMPD segment profit of approximately $65 million for fiscal year '24. We continue to expect to address the impact of inflation as we exit fiscal '24, along with continued Cardinal Health brand volume growth and benefits from our continued cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate a positive impact from seasonality in Q4 compared to Q3. We are also reiterating our segment profit guide for the Other businesses, 6% to 8% segment profit growth for the full year, given that we expect a strong Q4 for those businesses. On the topline, we now expect Other full year revenue growth of approximately 12%. So, as I highlighted earlier, we are raising our guidance for fiscal year '24 to $7.30 to $7.40. Finally, let me conclude my remarks by providing a guidance preview for fiscal year '25. We will provide formal fiscal year '25 guidance during our Q4 and full year earnings call in August. However, with the benefits of our raised fiscal year '24 expectations and the action plans already underway in response to recent market changes, here is our preliminary perspective. For our largest business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, while revenue will reset in the year as we offset a recent customer non-renewal, we notably expect to deliver at least 1% segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 before returning to more normalized growth in fiscal year '26. Looking forward, our commercial and operational teams have been busy, and our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace. Over the past several months, we have had some attractive wins with new customers and some existing customers are expanding their own footprints with us. Some of these are already under contract and ordering and others are scheduled for implementation in the second half of next fiscal year. So, over the course of the upcoming year, we expect new volume coming our way at sustainable margins. We completed the Specialty Networks acquisition quickly, which will be additive to our efforts in fiscal year '25. Separately, we have turned a further eye to optimizing our cost structure across our corporate functional footprint and across the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions portfolio. Regarding environmental factors, we are expecting brand inflation to be roughly equivalent to fiscal '24 levels, while we remain watchful relative to the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines. For the GMPD segment, we expect continued growth in fiscal year '25 on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year '26, driven by the annualization of inflation mitigation, progress with Cardinal Health brand growth, and continued simplification and cost optimization. We expect approximately $175 million in GMPD segment profit in fiscal year '25. And for the businesses included in Other, we expect the strong demand we've seen across these businesses to continue. With positive industry trends and the strength of our competitive positioning, we expect collective segment profit growth in fiscal year '25 at the top end of our long-term target approximately 10%. During fiscal '25, we will be investing across all of our businesses, with key examples being new facilities like our Consumer Health Logistics Center, at-Home Solutions facilities in Texas and South Carolina, and further geographic reach of our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions' PET network. We will also continue our build-out of Navista and investments in GMPD supply chain resiliency. Now a few call-outs below the line and with the balance sheet. We anticipate a significant step-up in interest and other next year, primarily due to much lower average cash balances due to cash already deployed for Specialty Networks and due to the one-time unwinding of negative net working capital from the large contract non-renewal. We also expect lower short-term investment rates on cash and higher interest rates on debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities, leading to an interest and other range of $160 million to $190 million in fiscal year '25. We expect our fiscal year '25 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%, slightly higher year-over-year due to discrete favorability seen this year. Partially offsetting these impacts, we would expect a lower share count between 244 million and 245 million due to the $500 million of baseline share repurchases we've previously outlined. Finally, while we continue to expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion on average from fiscal 2024 to 2026, we think it is important to call out that fiscal 2025 will be lower than that average, primarily due to the large contract unwind, as well as quarter end day of week timing. These dynamics will significantly influence our cash flow in Q1 of next year. However, our strong investment grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations. With respect to the long term, it is full speed ahead. We are reiterating our fiscal year '24 through '26 targets for the enterprise and segments and expect to deliver at least $7.50 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal year '25, which reflects at least 30% total EPS growth on a two year basis. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our businesses, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, where our focus remains executing in the core to build upon our strong foundation. We're continuing to invest in our core business to drive operational efficiency and provide improved customer focus capabilities. At the same time, we have been evolving our commercial engagement strategies to get closer to the customer, better understand their complex needs, and provide proactive solutions. As an example, we've highlighted our first to market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health InteLogix Platform, which deploys AI and machine learning through the Palantir Foundry platform to analyze real-time clinical and purchasing data to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories, and streamline medication supply. We've also developed the Cardinal Health Atrix Elements offering, which is a suite of hospital reimbursement services that help improve hospitals' workflows and efficiencies. We've driven tremendous progress in our services for health systems, leading to the successful onboarding of a new key customer and additional new health system business coming in fiscal '25. We recently broke ground on our new 350,000 square Consumer Health Logistics Center in Central Ohio that we see as a differentiator in the marketplace. Over the past several years, we've experienced growing demand for over the counter consumer health products, which are an important part of our offering for retail pharmacy customers, particularly among our valued retail independent community pharmacies. With innovative technology and automation solutions powering the new facility, which will serve as a centralized replenishment center, we anticipate improved inventory efficiency across our network and providing unparalleled supply chain responsiveness for our customers. We see the rapid development of advanced automation technologies as an ongoing opportunity for our business. During the quarter, we deployed new sortation systems in a number of our distribution centers with a continual focus on employee safety, customer service, and operational efficiency. Turning to specialty, where we have and will continue to invest to accelerate our growth. As Aaron noted, our integration of Specialty Networks is underway and the reaction from the providers we serve and the energy from our new teammates has been extremely encouraging. Specialty Networks' mission as part of Cardinal Health remains creating clinical and economic value for independent physicians by lowering costs, operating more efficiently, and helping them deliver best-in-class care to their patients. We see greater opportunities together with the business' multi-specialty platform, proprietary technology, and deep clinical expertise being a natural extension of Cardinal Health's suite of solutions for specialty practices across the country. Specialty Networks expands our offerings with physicians in the areas of urology, GI, and rheumatology, while providing a proven platform in PPS analytics that we'll further invest into in fiscal '25 and look to extend to other therapeutic areas such as oncology. The platform's insight generation capabilities for clinicians are robust, which accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. We see these and other capabilities as supporting our ongoing build-out of Navista, our clinician-designed oncology practice alliance, offering advanced services and technology. Navista's mission is to unlock the power of community oncologists to secure their independence and revolutionize patient centered cancer care. This build-out continues to progress according to plan as we actively pilot next-generation technologies and capabilities with select oncology practices. Upstream with manufacturers, we saw a strong performance from our biopharma solutions business during the quarter. With scaled assets, differentiated solutions, and a tenured team of experts, our leading specialty 3PL has supported 23 launches year-to-date through March with more anticipated in the coming quarters. Our 3PL and regulatory consulting capabilities helped pioneer the commercialization of the first CAR T-cell and gene therapies years ago, and we continue to bring innovative services to the market. Opening in May, our Advanced Therapy Innovation Center that features a deep frozen storage suite will support the complex storage requirements of cell and gene therapies. And we've seen our Advanced Therapy Solutions and Nuclear, Precision Health Solutions businesses successfully collaborating in support of cell and gene manufacturers. Turning to the GMPD business, where we're executing our GMPD Improvement Plan. We continued to drive momentum across the business in Q3 with strong sequential segment profit growth and significant improvement versus prior year. During the quarter, we offset approximately 90% of the gross inflation impact on our business, through the execution of our mitigation initiatives, commercial contracting efforts, and the continued realization of reduced costs for international freight, we're on track with our target to address these impacts by the time we exit fiscal '24. We are pleased to achieve 4% topline growth in the quarter, reflecting the improving health of our business. We saw growth across Cardinal Health brand and core distribution and in our domestic and international businesses. Specifically, our 5 point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volumes continues to show positive trends across the key leading indicators. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution has increased by 14 points in the past two years and is up over 20 points from its pandemic low a few years ago. We successfully retained key distribution customers and the team is gearing up for some new customer implementations in the months ahead. Our product back orders remain near multi-year lows and we've continued to develop and commercialize new products, such as our Kendall pediatric sleeve to prevent deep vein thrombosis risk in young patients. We've noted our investments in the resiliency of our supply chain to better service our customers. In Q3, our efforts were recognized as the first distributor to achieve the highest rating by Healthcare Industry Resilience Collaborative's resiliency badge program, a key industry benchmark of our progress. Finally, we are executing our simplification initiatives across our business with a continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and global manufacturing and supply chain. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we're realizing continued double-digit growth in Theranostics, driven by the successful launch execution of new and advanced Theranostics in oncology. For example, we have realized meaningful growth in fiscal '24 from the adoption and growing demand of prostate cancer radio diagnostics, which are an important tool for healthcare providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We see a large, growing, and diversified pipeline, positioning our business to deliver value long into the future. The pipeline consists of more than 60 opportunities across oncology, cardiology, and neurology that are either contracted, in negotiations, or being actively explored with pharmaceutical companies. As an example, in oncology, we look forward to expanding our support level of novel prostate radioligand therapies in fiscal '25. As we look into the future, when you consider the strength of the Theranostics pipeline, only a handful of successful products are needed to deliver the strong growth outlined in our long-term targets. Our at-Home Solutions plays an instrumental role in providing patients and caregivers the critical products and services they need for care in the home. We continue to see strong demand for home healthcare and over the past decade, we've grown from servicing about 1 million customers annually to around 5 million today. Our business is positioned to accelerate in the coming years as we invest to expand the capacity of our network, the breadth of our offering, and deploy new automation technology. We're excited that our new distribution center being built in South Carolina, featuring the fastest order fulfillment system per square foot in the market, is scheduled to open by early next fiscal year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we continue to hear from our customers the value of our TotalVue Insights technology platform is providing as they seek to control their shipping spend and drive performance. Our technology provides action driving analytics and benchmarks with shipping status and delay visibility. We continue to invest in new technology driven solutions, and true to our commitment to innovation, we collaborate side-by-side with customers. For example, this quarter, we successfully co-developed and introduced a tailored pharmacy shipping solution with a strategic customer across multiple facilities. Across our businesses, opportunities are everywhere we look. We've affirmed our long-term targets for the enterprise and segments, which reflects Cardinal Health's ability to achieve sustained growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through an ongoing focus on value creation. We continue to prioritize the prudent management of our balance sheet and responsible capital allocation. We remain well-positioned with the financial flexibility to continue investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. As part of our simplification journey, we are taking proactive actions to optimize our future cost structure and enhance our ability to grow well into the future. During the quarter, we took substantial steps to reduce our corporate real estate footprint and reorganized certain teams for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Our business review committee continues to make progress on our ongoing review of the GMPD business. We have no further updates to share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. Driving the improvement plan remains our near-term priority and the team is making excellent progress. To close, we've had a strong first-three quarters of the year and are focused on sprinting through the tape. Plans are in place to deliver growth in fiscal '25 and beyond, and we're eager to continue delivering for our many stakeholders. None of this would be possible without our highly engaged and talented team, who continues to lean in, drive our company forward, and fulfill our critical role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lisa Gill coming from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Jason, I just really want to dig into the 2025 guidance that you've given, especially when we think about Rx and specialty business. We clearly know that revenue will be down because of the change Rx, I'm sorry, because of the OptumRx contract, but... Operator : Very sorry about that, gentlemen. Her line appears just to have dropped. So if she could just maybe dial back in, I will put her back in the queue. But now, we will move to Michael Cherny. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning, and hopefully, my line won't drop. I probably had a similar question on Lisa, so hopefully you can address this directly. Relative to the '25 segment EBIT, as you think about the moving pieces here, maybe a two-part question. First, is there any way you can give us an underlying growth rate beyond the loss of Optum? And then second, as you think about the at least 1% segment performance, can you give us just a further breakdown on how much of that is volume growth versus mix versus new customers? Any more color you can provide on that as we think about the jumping off point and then how that factors into '26 would be great. Thanks so much. Aaron Alt : Good morning. This is Aaron. I appreciate the question, and happy to provide a little more context. I want to start by observing that the PS&S team has got -- have strong plans for '25 as they continue to deliver against what was a very strong fiscal '24. We had provided long-term guidance for PS&S of 4% to 6% profit growth. As we now think about that in comparison to the guidance we provided today of at least 1% profit growth within that segment, the delta, you should think about it is really the impact of profit -- net impact of profit so far relative to the Optum business. And the simple math I do is, if you take the midpoint of our long-term guidance, the 5%, each percentage point is worth about $20 million. You take it down to the 1% -- at least 1% that we've guided, that's about an $80 million net impact so far that we are working through. So that's the profit guide I would give you. On the revenue side, I would observe that we've already provided the impact that fiscal '23 was about 16% of our revenue. Fiscal '24, not yet done, will land somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion of revenue. Back that out, but recognizing that the portfolio is still growing 10% or so as we push ahead. And then lastly, on the cash flow side of the house, I hope you noted my comments that we are holding to our average of $2 billion of adjusted cash flow each year in the '24 to '26 period. It will be lower in '25 as we work-through the negative working capital position from that non-renewed contract and a days of week impact. But this is manageable and as you -- I hope you take away from the fact we're calling growth as we push ahead for PS&S. We have plans in place. Jason, anything you want to add? Jason Hollar : Yeah. Just I'll build out a little bit further the puts and takes for '25. As Aaron highlighted and scoped it, the delta is a net approximately $80 million when you look at the -- those different reference points. So, that obviously implies an Optum impact of something greater than that, that's being partially mitigated through several different items that we've called out. One is the other customer progress that we've had. So this value proposition is definitely resonating well with our customers and so we've had good win rates in other areas. And so, that would allow us some opportunity to partially offset that, that's included in that net $80 million, as well as the inclusion of Specialty Networks. So overall, specialty growth, we expect to continue to be strong. And then we have the Specialty Networks acquisition that closed last month. So we'll get kind of a three quarter type of year-over-year benefit, because we'll have it in our fourth quarter as well and the ongoing growth with that. And then there's some opportunity to further reduce cost by streamlining our processes even further, simplifying even further. So, overall, we feel really good about those offsets and that gets us to that net about 4 percentage points that we're calling out right now. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll now move to George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys. And Jason, I kind of have a question around the intersection of the competitive environment in specialty. The industry has been pretty stable without any large contract switches for a while, though, we saw two kind of in the last handful of months. And my question is, like, given the composition of assets in the pharmaceutical business right now, are you seeing more of a demand for what I would call like cross functional service where people want to see core pharmaceutical distribution with other parts of specialty with -- as it relates to oncology and just trying to figure out, like, how do you guys deal with the breadth of solutions that you offer as the competitive environment evolves? Jason Hollar : Yeah. There's a couple of things I think about this, George. First of all, thanks for the question. As I step back and think about just the backdrop of your question on the competitive environment, there -- while there are a couple changing hands, as you highlighted, I think the overall market continues to behave in a very rational way. We continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined in how we participate within it. And it's the exception of those contracts changing hands. The vast majority of contracts don't change hands as they come up for renewal. So I don't think that that -- it changes things. And you -- while you're still stepping back from everything, our role ultimately on the distribution side is to safely, securely, and efficiently deliver these products for our customers, that hasn't changed. Now, I think your question is, are there other elements that make that evolve further. Hey, we've got the full suite of services. We are building those out further. I think our customers always are looking for opportunities where we can add additional value. That hasn't changed either. It just evolves as to where they are most focused, and each customer has a little bit different value proposition from which to build from. So that will resonate better with some customers than others. And our objective is to continue to build out those capabilities, both upstream and downstream, so that we can be that full service supplier and partner to ensure that we can help them grow their business. Aaron Alt : George, I would add one further thought, which is, as you see from examples like our acquisition of Specialty Networks, of course, we continue to work to get closer to the ultimate practitioner, so that we are prepared to offer the incremental services that the industry is demanding. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Please go ahead again. Lisa Gill : Good morning, and thank you, and hopefully, this time it will work. So my question was actually asked, but I wanted to just really dig in just a little bit deeper. As I think about the cadence for 2025, I know you're not giving specific guidance, but maybe even first half, second half, as we think about some of the comments you made, for example, simplifying costs, right, that'll... Operator : Okay. Very sorry about that. It would appear we're -- I'm very sorry, gentlemen. It's just that her line has dropped. Jason Hollar : Well -- yeah, I think we can understand where she was going with trying to build out further for first half versus second half. So, the one thing I would stress, let's talk about the puts and takes and the timing of the puts and takes. So this customer migration will be somewhat of a cliff event at the end of the fiscal year. So, the June 30 to July 1, which is exactly the beginning of the fiscal year. So, that first quarter, we'll see that volume drop off fairly precipitously. And then the other business that we've won, some of it is already feathering in, some of it will continue over the course of the year, and we've highlighted in our comments a lot of it will be in the second half of fiscal '25. So, the timing of that, that piece of the puts and takes will be a little bit more second half weighted. Especially networks I referenced, that is a nice tailwind that is going to start benefiting us. It's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll have three quarters of year-over-year performance driven by that business being added in and the continued just overall growth of utilization over the course of next year that we expect as well. The other cost actions will be varied. There's some things we've been planning for this for quite some time. And so, some of those cost actions will be in place by the end of the year. Some of those will need to take time to allow our operations to settle with that lower volume. So this is a customer that beyond it being -- it's a large and growing customer. So we definitely liked that volume. At the same time, it was a customer that had a lot of non-standard and customized processes and the demand profile was a bit more volatile. So we'll be able to operate more efficiently as this volume exits, but that won't necessarily be a day one type of thing. It will take us a little bit of time to get the each of the individual sites to be flowing with the new product that is coming in, but also just optimizing with the existing product. So the puts and takes there are all items that we start to see some mitigation at the very beginning of the fiscal year and then build over the course of the year. Operator : Thanks. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Allen Lutz, calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. We've heard anecdotally that generic prices are a little bit firmer this time versus maybe last year. Can you talk a little bit about buy side and sell side pricing here of generics and maybe how gross profit dollars in that part of the business in generics are trending versus... Aaron Alt : So, thanks for the question. What we would tell you is, as we continue to be in an environment of consistent market dynamics, where we see stability on the buy and the sell within our generic business. As we've talked about in the past, the stability that comes with that is when we see a rising tide of volume and a strong prescription demand environment, which we have, we continue to see strength in the generics portfolio, and that's where we are. We are aware that others have made comments somewhat variant from that over time, but we see consistent market dynamics and view that stability as a strength of our portfolio. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to Kevin Caliendo, calling from UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. I'll try to ask quickly before it gets dropped. Can you help us bridge on the medical side sort of the inputs to get to your fiscal '25 operating income from sort of where we are today? What are the most important factors that will get us from sort of where we are with the run rate through fiscal 3Q of '24 to the expected numbers in fiscal '25? And then just a quick follow-up. Does the loss of Optum and your partner in Red Oak also lost a large payer contract. Has that affected Red Oak in any way, shape, or form or your purchasing power or your economics there? I'm just wondering how to think about that, because it's two sizable chunks of business, but I just don't know how to think about the impact on Red Oak. Thank you. Aaron Alt : Why don't I start with the med cadence and then turn over to Jason to talk further about Red Oak? Look, the med, the -- or rather the GMPD business, we are executing against the plan that we've now been talking about for several quarters. And a couple of numbers on the page. Fiscal year '23, it was a negative $165 million; in fiscal '24 today, we've confirmed we're calling a positive $65 million. That's about a $230 million swing, which puts us halfway to the fiscal '26 target of $300 million. Fiscal '25, we've called today, will be approximately $175 million, really a midpoint between those. How we get there is how we have gotten -- how we've gotten halfway there so far. The single biggest initiative, single biggest impact to those numbers is continuing to achieve the inflation mitigation that we've been talking about for several quarters. We exited Q3 at about 90%. We expect to achieve full mitigation by the end of the fiscal year. But as we move into next year, of course, we'll be lapping the lower percentage execution. So that will be tailwind. That will be significant tailwind for us certainly in the first half and, indeed, the first -- for the full year. It's also important that we continue to see the good revenue growth and, in particular, the good volume and revenue growth tied to the Cardinal Health brand is that is a broader -- that is a more profitable part of our business. I know you noticed that in Q1, we called out a positive change in trend relative to the revenue in that business. Q2, we saw 2% growth. Q4 we saw 4% growth. And so, we're seeing signs of progress that give us reasons to believe that we can achieve both the $65 million this year and the $175 million next year. Lastly, on the cadence and the importance, the team will continue to do what they've been doing around simplification and cost out, right? It's a very complex business and the team has been doing a good job of simplifying and identifying sources of cost this year, and that will continue into next year as well. Jason, anything you want to add or talk about Red Oak? Jason Hollar : Nothing to add on that component. As it relates to Red Oak, we feel very good about the scale and competitiveness of that venture -- joint venture that we have with CVS. The combined volume that we both bring is sufficient to have significant scale in the space. The percentage of volume that was related to the lost customer is quite small relative to the total that we have that remains. So we feel good about our -- continuing our mandate of both continued value for our partners and, ultimately, our customers and as well as the dual mandate aspect of also driving supply as much as possible. Kevin Caliendo : Thank you, sir. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : We'll now go to Eric Percher, calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. A couple of modest items relative to Pharma that I wanted to tick through. One is, in discussing the headwind, penciling out to $80 million, you used the comment so far once or twice. Is that so far reflecting that there may be more mitigation or that this is influx? That would be one. Number two, is there a contemplation of any incentive comp reduction in '25 that would then reset in '26 in that mitigation? And the last one is, Specialty Networks, it sounds like you're expecting a benefit at the op profit line. I believe the comment when you closed it was it would be accretive 12 months following close. Any commentary on contribution there would be helpful as well. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yeah. So I -- the so far comment was simply to highlight that we are guiding to at least 1% growth. And so, that reference is entirely around, of course, we continue to look for other opportunities to mitigate further. And depending upon our success with those additional actions will be the answer to your question about incentive comp. We'll, of course, appropriately define a target with the alignment with our Board to ensure that we are motivated to drive the business forward. And then, as it relates to Specialty Networks, our underlying assumptions are unchanged. The accretive comment was -- you're right, Eric, that the reference point was a year after the close and that was including the dilutive effect on the interest. So, the lost interest on $1 billion, $1.2 billion is the offset to the operating earnings that we see within the Pharma business. So it's really just the geography of the plus and minus with that. Aaron Alt : Eric, you had also asked about the impact to compensation plans. And the point I would make is, we set compensation plans on an annual basis for the management teams. And -- but we also have a long-term element, which is highlighted in our proxy, the targets there, and we'll continue to -- the teams will be continually motivated to hit those objectives. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, gentlemen. The next question will be coming from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. You called out a few new wins and expansions in the prepared remarks and you did highlight some customer progress that offsets the Optum headwinds. So I was hoping we can dig in there a little bit more. Can you tell us about the nature of these wins? Is this more core? Is it onc (ph)? Is it other ologies? And how much the bridge from FY \u201825 to the three year guidance relies on further progress with these wins versus more of the streamlining and cost-out that you've called out? Jason Hollar : Yeah. So it's across various classes of trade. So it's broad based wins that we've received. We are not anticipating needing additional new wins beyond what we've already completed or in process of completing. And that's why when you think about the embedded guidance that we're talking about in terms of maintaining our long-term targets of that 4% to 6% growth, some years like this year were at the above the high end and next year, it will be a little bit below the low end, but the average is out to that 4% to 6%. And so, it implies a '26 and beyond type of rate that continues to be in that 4% to 6% range, which is kind of a normal -- normalized ongoing type of earnings level. So what -- how I step back and think about our progress to date, it really comes down to our service levels and our customer service and really listening to what is important to those customers and working with them for a solution that is not necessarily customized, it is standardized, but with their needs in mind. And we're getting fantastic feedback from our current customers in terms of what that service level has been that is translating over to the desire by customers that we're not working with today to consider using Cardinal Health. And so, we have the time, attention, and energy now that we're able to devote even more to those existing customers to streamline those processes in a little bit more of a simplified fashion, and we'll continue to drive that value proposition with those new customers. But it's very much a booked business type of perspective that we're now into execution mode. And after this year, fiscal '25, we'd expect it to be even more normalized at that point. Aaron Alt : I would add a couple of things to that. First, you asked about cost-out, and my response or our response is that simplification has been a priority of ours for the last couple of years, and we will, of course, continue to go looking for ways we can simplify our operations and optimize our cost. But let me be clear, right, we are not backing away from customer support, particularly the new customers coming onboard, so that we do that seamlessly. And we're not backing away from investing in our future across our enterprise. And so, we will continue to talk about the highlights of those as we make them in future earnings calls, but we will optimize as appropriate, while focused on the long term. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll now move to Eric Coldwell, calling from Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to talk a bit about specialty in general and then tie in Specialty Networks. So, in the recent past, you've given a sizing of your overall specialty business in the low-to-mid $30 billion range. You will lose some of that with the Optum roll off, probably $3.5 billion, $4 billion, I'm guessing. You're going to add some with Specialty Networks, and then you have normal market growth. So, netting this all together, what would you anticipate the baseline specialty business to be sized at when you start fiscal '25? Jason Hollar : So, those are a number of puts and takes that as you noticed, I'm sure, Eric, we did not provide revenue guidance in this update. We will be providing that in the next update, of course. So, certainly, you're in the ballpark on the Optum piece, as I've highlighted before, that is about 10% of that overall book of business. That specialty, everything else would be, PD, non-specialty. And Specialty Networks, the revenue is quite low, because it's the service revenue, it's not distribution revenue. So that's what I would think of independent is that we, of course, would expect our non-Optum specialty revenue to continue to grow nicely and we will frame that, but don't think about that as something specifically related to Specialty Networks. Operator : Thank you very much. Next question is coming from Elizabeth Anderson, calling from Evercore. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Anderson : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about -- more about GMPD. It seems like the competitive environment maybe is improving in your favor. It seems like maybe there's some benefit from underlying just like utilization demand. Could you please just give us a little bit more color on sort of those underlying changing dynamics in more -- maybe more conceptually and about some of the specific cost-cutting and other inflation offsets that you've already talked about? Jason Hollar : Yeah. I think the competitive environment, I'm not sure I'd put much into that. Our performance within this industry has improved dramatically. I referenced in my comments, the customer loyalty scores improve -- have improved consistently and dramatically from the bottom of the pandemic a couple of years ago. So, our performance is noticeable. Our customers are feeling it. That customer loyalty index, the scores behind it improving, because we have -- we have the low back order, we have product availability, we have great service levels. We're very engaged from a sales force perspective. So we're out there now selling instead of reacting to the challenges of the pandemic. So our customers are feeling that. We have very stable win/loss types of rates. We're growing at least with the market now. So it's more of us showing up, I think, the right way than the market being overly growing more or growing less. The market utilization continues to be more and more normalized. So there's maybe a little bit of volatility here and there, but it's much more normalized compared to where it has been in the last several years. So, not -- that -- and that's the environment we like. We like to see predictable, consistent lower-single digit type of utilization rates that we can grow a little bit above that through our mix and other actions. And then, of course, as Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver, not only this past year, but that -- what we expect at least in the first half of next year, would be just the lapping of the inflation impacts and everything we've done to mitigate that. Which -- that's another thing that's helpful for us to get that behind us so that we're focused on selling and talking to our customers about the value that we can help provide them, as opposed to dealing with inflationary fluctuations that have occurred in the past. So we're well-positioned to now drive the other elements of the medical -- the GMPD Improvement Plan, which is the ongoing simplification, the ongoing cost reductions, but just continuing to really prioritize more than anything the Cardinal Health brand volume growth. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Stephen Baxter, calling from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just one quick confirmation and the actual question. I think what you're suggesting is that beyond fiscal 2025, there is no direct or indirect impact from the Optum contract loss to contemplate. Just wanted to confirm that point, that there's not any kind of earnings contribution from a transitional period inside the 2025 thinking. And then the actual question is just on the Other segment. The revenue growth has been quite strong. It's taken a little bit for the profit growth to kind of catch up to your long-term expectations. Just remind us what the key kind of moving parts are there to accelerate the profit growth in the next couple of years. Thanks. Aaron Alt : So, an answer to your first question, our guide today does confirm the long-term growth within the Pharma business of 4% to 6%. It will be off a lower base in fiscal '25 as we grow at least the 1%. We've not commented on an absolute dollar basis, but we will provide more context on that when we get to our year end results and final guidance for fiscal '25 during our August earnings call. With respect to the Other business, we are pleased with what we're seeing so far. We re-segmented the operation to create additional transparency, focus, and accountability, and I referenced in my prepared remarks that we are already seeing the benefit of that. The topline results are good, right? And we guided 6% to 8% profit growth for this year. We were a little bit lower than that in Q3 for the businesses aggregating in Other so far. And of course, we had the impact of some of the non-recurring adjustments that we called out in Q2 tied to the at-Home business, which reports into Other in the second quarter. But I want to emphasize, we did confirm that we are expecting to achieve the higher results, the 8% to 10% for fiscal '24 and we confirm the high end of that range for fiscal '25, as Jason digs in with the businesses now reporting directly to them and as we invest as an enterprise against setting those businesses up for a higher growth trajectory. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Just a couple of things to add. First, on the first question, just to be real explicit, given it's a cliff event customer transition that we are anticipating for July 1, we'd anticipate that that would be largely in fiscal '25 results and there's nothing that we're calling out or indicating at this point that would carry over into '26. And as it relates to the Other businesses, how I think about them, they're each growing very nicely. They each have strong industry, strong sectors of the industry that are benefiting from their own individual secular tailwinds. So, they each have different reasons for their growth. But ultimately, it's because that each of these three areas provide a real interesting value proposition to customers and, ultimately, to the patients. And each of these three, we have a leadership position in. So we're not only benefiting from that secular trend, but we're leading and maintaining or growing our own fair share within it. So we're well positioned for each one of these three and why we have confidence about them. We are investing into them, as Aaron highlighted. That's driving the growth that we believe will be driving long-term profitability as well. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lucas Romanski : Hi. This is Lucas on for Charles. I wanted to ask about Cardinal Health brand and get a sense of where we're at on the path to realizing $50 million in targeted growth by fiscal '26. I understand that you've expanded the number of products you offer under private label and that you're starting to see momentum in growing volumes. Can you help us understand how much of that $50 million has already been realized? And then how much we should expect you guys to realize in fiscal '25? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yeah. So I'd -- the -- it's a -- we inflected a couple of quarters ago, right? You saw that with our overall revenue growth that is partly driven by the Cardinal Health brand volume growth. So we saw, for example, this quarter, our revenue growth of 4% was pro-rated within that national brand, as well as Cardinal Health brand, so, we're seeing distribution stabilize. We're seeing that. We've won some business there that has allowed us to grow at or a little bit better than the market. So, overall, we're seeing that this business has now stabilized at a growth consistent with the market. We expect that to continue. This is something that we do have as a component of that growth. As Aaron highlighted, the single biggest driver of profit performance for '25 -- from '24 to '25 is the annualization, the carryover of the inflationary pressure. So that's the biggest item of that implied $100 million, $110 million year-over-year profit improvement. Then beyond that, you have Cardinal Health brand volume growth, cost reductions, and other actions. And so, it is a component, it's not the biggest component. And then it would be a -- from '25 to '26, the primary components that then drive that growth would be Cardinal Health brand volume, as well as further cost reductions as we continue to look to streamline and optimize our footprint, as well as our other supporting cost. So, we're not going to break out the individual pieces there, but those are the biggest pieces then when you go from '25 to '26. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. Our last question today will be coming from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Daniel Grosslight : Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been asked, but I was hoping to just get an update on Navista and any metrics you're able to share on the market adoption you're seeing there, number of providers aligned to it, etc. And I know one of the key strategic objectives of the Specialty Networks acquisition was to kind of integrate some of their technology, notably PSS Analytics (ph) into Navista and other specialty assets. I'm also curious if you can provide an update on how quickly you can integrate that technology and Murphy, you've already kind of started on that path. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Daniel. And so, with Navista, we are on track to everything that we've laid out first raising this about a year ago. I mean, as I think about the progress we've made, I'd break it into a few key buckets. First of all -- first and foremost, we've hired and brought in a fantastic team, a great mixture of internal and external talent, really drawing from industry those that have done this before and understand what that looks like, but also using our own expertise that have been more focused in other therapeutic areas, but a nice augmentation of the two. And then that new team quickly went to work and defined what went in front of our customers and prospective customers and really listened as to what is it that they need to run their practice, their business more efficiently, more effectively. And it was through that work that we then came to the final point, which is defining the tools, the capabilities that we are building within Navista. So, we didn't just go off and build it. We are building it around what the customers are demanding that they need, those community oncologists, those independent community oncologists, really looking at differentiating for what they need to run their business, both again, efficiently, but also effectively to further improve upon the lives of their patients. So that is the work that's been done, and we are every day building out more elements of this. So I wouldn't think about it as a particular date that everything goes live and we suddenly have this influx of volume. This is the type of thing that builds out our capability over time in different ways and working with our current customers, as well as the prospective ones to layer in when they come into this network and which services they utilize within the network. So that leads you to the Specialty Networks piece, which I would think about it as we now have an internal technology and capability set that's augmenting what we had before. But Navista always approached this in terms of the best of the best in the industry. Using what we have is great, but we also are using a lot of third-party partners to bring in their tools and capabilities, because we're going to put the customers' needs first, the providers' needs first and then build around that. So we do see that there is a role for Specialty Networks and their PPS Analytics platform, but we're not going to make that the priority. We're going to listen to the customers and then determine which pieces of that to bring into that network. So we haven't finalized those decisions as it relates to Specialty Networks. But what I will tell you, on day one, just having that team's insight and expertise has been very beneficial to our own Navista team. So having -- and I mentioned this when we announced the acquisition of Specialty Networks. Yeah, the assets are fantastic. The business is fantastic. But the most important thing for us was the leadership team and the capabilities that they're bringing along with it is every bit as great as what we thought it was when we made the announcement. And we're seeing that with boots on the ground now as we work, not just within Navista, but with the broader business to further improve our capabilities across all the therapeutic areas. Operator : Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I turn the call back over to Mr. Jason Hollar for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Thank you. Just to close, appreciate everyone spending some time with us this morning. We hope the overall message that you took away from the call today is that we have a strong and resilient business and a very clear plan for us for '25 and '26, and we're excited about the opportunities and ensuring that our customers and their patients continue to get fantastic service. So thanks again for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your attendance. You may disconnect. Have a good day and goodbye.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Fiscal year \u201924 marked a year of strong operational execution and record financial results for Cardinal Health, delivered in tandem with significant strategic progress across the portfolio. On that note, we have three key headlines today. First, we finished the year with momentum, growing EPS 29% in both Q4 and fiscal year \u201924. Our results exceeded guidance and full-year EPS of $7.53 was $0.96 above the midpoint of our original outlook from investor day. We also delivered nearly $4 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, positioning us with approximately $5 billion of cash at year end, even after $1.25 billion of capital returned to shareholders this year and funding our growth investments. Second, we have managed through the transition of a significant customer and are raising our guidance for fiscal year \u201925, while also reconfirming our long term financial targets. Finally, we continue to advance our strategy to build upon the growth and resiliency of pharma and specialty, execute our GMPD improvement plan, and accelerate our growth in key areas while optimizing our portfolio to maximize shareholder value creation. More on that momentarily, but first some brief reflections. This year, we continue to take decisive actions to simplify our business and drive performance, highlighted by the reorganization of our operating and segment reporting structure to enhance management focus while enabling efficiencies, accountability and transparency. We grew our largest and most significant business, pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, above our targeted long term growth rate. We saw ongoing stability in pharmaceutical demand, strong performance from our generics program, and our specialty business grew revenue 14% for the year. As of fiscal year \u201924, our specialty business is now over $36 billion and we anticipate continued growth next year despite a large contract expiration. We prioritize key growth areas in specialty with organic investments across therapeutic areas and the acquisition of specialty networks. In GMPD, we executed our improvement plan initiatives, returning the business to profitability and delivering approximately $240 million in year-over-year segment profit improvement. Notably, we achieved our year-end inflation mitigation target, a critical milestone for the business. Across our other operating businesses, we collectively grew revenue 12% and segment profit 7% in fiscal year \u201924. We\u2019ve seen strong demand across nuclear, at-home solutions and OptiFreight, and our purposeful investments and focus on performance excites us about how these businesses are positioned for the future. Overall, these results were achieved through our team\u2019s commitment to execute against a focused set of priorities to create value for our shareholders, our customers, and ultimately for millions of patients. As we turn the page to fiscal year \u201925, our confidence is reinforced by our strong and resilient business with positive industry trends supporting our growth, and we continue to take actions to optimize not only the performance of our businesses but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise. Before I hand the call over to Aaron, let me provide an update on our business and portfolio review which, as a reminder, kicked off in September of 2022. Last June, we concluded our review of the former pharma segment highlighted at investor day with our enhanced organizational focus on specialty and decision to retain and further and invest in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. Then in January, we finalized our review of the growth businesses within the former medical segment, determining the best course of action for shareholder value creation was to invest in and further develop at-home solutions and OptiFreight for long term growth, while also completing our re-segmentation. All along, management in collaboration with the business review committee and board has been reviewing GMPD from every angle as the team executes our turnaround plan. We deeply understand the business\u2019 opportunities and complexities and today have some preliminary conclusions to share through the lens of our portfolio review framework, as seen on Slide 20. In short, we remain committed to executing the GMPD improvement plan and our fiscal year \u201926 target of $300 million in segment profits. We were pleased and unsurprised to see significant interest in GMPD during our review. The business is core to the operations of so many healthcare providers and features not only our formidable distribution expertise but a broad set of Cardinal Health brand products that are critical to patient care. Following our extensive review, we have gained confidence that we are best positioned to continue capitalizing on the meaningful growth and operational opportunities on the horizon for this business. Ultimately, we see more value creation potential ahead for our shareholders by continuing to drive the GMPD turnaround plan. Even more, our analysis uncovered additional opportunities to unlock near term value through further simplification actions and working capital improvements while continuing to drive the plan. From these initiatives, we plan to generate at least $500 million in cash over the next two years to be deployed according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. In recognition, we\u2019re raising our share repurchase expectations for fiscal year \u201925 to a total of $750 million, which is beyond our $500 million baseline. In terms of the mechanics of future reviews as the business continues to improve, the business review committee of our board sunset in July as planned, and the ongoing value creation efforts are now being overseen by the board as a whole. As always, we take a thorough, objective and open-minded approach focused on maximizing long term shareholder value creation while continuing to invest in the business to ensure that our customers receive the products and service they expect. I\u2019ll go deeper into our strategic plans for our segments later in my remarks, but first let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and guidance. Aaron Alt : Thank you Jason, and good morning. Before discussing our Q4 success and our raised guidance, I want to highlight that today, we are providing revised prior period financials for fiscal year \u201922 through Q3 fiscal year \u201924, reflecting slight net increases to non-GAAP EPS. During the preparation of our annual financial statements, management identified a longstanding accounting error in part of our at-home solutions business related to revenue recognition from third party payors. As a result, we have corrected this item in prior periods and also updated the timing of other previously recognized immaterial out-of-period items across the full enterprise. The net impact of these changes increases non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 in fiscal year \u201924, $0.06 in fiscal year \u201923, and $0.01 in fiscal year \u201922. To be helpful, we\u2019ve included supplemental schedules in our press release along with further detail in our fiscal year \u201924 10-K. Moving to our results, I am pleased to reinforce that Q4 produced a strong finish to a year in which the Cardinal team made tremendous progress against our financial and strategic priorities. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points with operating profit growth across pharma, GMPD and other, also supported by improvements below the line in the form of lower interest costs, better tax rates, and lower share count. We delivered strong gross margin growth and matched it with well controlled SG&A, even in an inflationary environment. In Q4, revenue increased 12% to $59.9 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the pharmaceutical and specialty solutions segment, the GMPD segment, and in all of the businesses making up other. Gross margin grew 5% to $1.9 billion, outpacing consolidated SG&A which increased only 2% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting our disciplined cost management. This translated to total company operating earnings of $605 million, up 14% versus last year. Below the line, interest and other improved $6 million versus prior year to $10 million, benefiting from the quarter\u2019s strong cash outperformance. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 24.6%, 4.5 percentage points lower than the prior year. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 4% lower than a year ago due to our previously announced share repurchases. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.84, growth of 29%. Moving into our segment results, beginning with the pharma segment on Slide 11, fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $55.6 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories : brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment\u2019s Q4 revenue growth would be 9%. As we have commented previously, GLP-1 sales do not meaningful contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 8% to $482 million in the fourth quarter, driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we continue to see volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. Pharma segment profit growth in the quarter was 8% despite an approximate $15 million margin headwind related to the unwind of the previously announced large customer transition. This unanticipated impact in the quarter was the primary difference between pharma\u2019s Q4 results and the midpoint of our prior guidance. Recall that we\u2019d previously observed that the impact of the contract loss would be offset by new customers, specialty networks, and cost controls as part of our contingency planning. Consistent with these mitigation plans, the team began implementing cost control measures and started to see offsetting savings. We also saw strong growth from biopharma solutions in the quarter, including contributions from specialty networks. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 12, we are quite pleased by the Q4 GMPD results which confirmed our team\u2019s continued progress against the GMPD improvement plan. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. We again saw growth in Cardinal brand volumes during the quarter. GMPD delivered Q4 segment profit of $47 million, generally consistent with our expectations and our prior guidance of approximately $65 million for the year before the prior period revisions. The $40 million year-over-year increase in Q4 was driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives as we achieved our target of offsetting the gross impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year \u201924. We continue to be encouraged by the tenacity of the team in driving improved execution in customer satisfaction and service levels while identifying additional opportunities to optimize the business. Finishing with the businesses that aggregate into other, as seen on Slide 13, fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $1.2 billion, driven by growth across all three businesses : at-home solutions, nuclear and precision health solutions, and OptiFreight logistics. Segment profit grew 11% to $111 million primarily driven by the performance of OptiFreight logistics. The OptiFreight business continues to hit on all cylinders as increasing customer demand for our logistics management services is met with strong execution. In nuclear and at-home solutions, we continue to invest strategically to supercharge growth. All three businesses as key parts of our growth story have received and will receive going forward access to capital for expansion of their business models in support of our customers. I will be brief on the full-year commentary. Fiscal \u201924 revenue increased 11% to $227 billion, with growth from all five operating segments. Gross margin increased 8% to $7.4 billion while SG&A increased a more modest 4% to $5 billion, reflecting our year-long efforts to control costs. Together, this resulted in fiscal \u201924 total operating earnings growth of 16% to $2.4 billion. All-in, it was an excellent year across the business. Below the line, interest and other decreased 52% to $42 million, driven by increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 21.7%. Average diluted shares outstanding were 247 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. The net result was fiscal \u201924 non-GAAP EPS of $7.53, growth of 29%, well above our long term target of 12% to 14% growth. Now before I turn to fiscal \u201925, let\u2019s cover the balance sheet. For fiscal \u201924, our ending cash balance was $5.1 billion. The cash position includes $200 million earmarked for the November 2024 debt maturity, with an additional $200 million to be paid through the time deposits held in prepaid assets and other on the balance sheet. To get there, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow, nearly $4 billion in fiscal year \u201924. Recall that at our investor day last June, I commented that cash flow remained an area of opportunity for us. Our excellent adjusted free cash flow result in 2024 was almost entirely a result of the team\u2019s year-long effort to optimize each element of our working capital while remaining focused on our service levels. To a much lesser degree, the results reflect balanced preparation for the Q1 contract expiration, which has now occurred in July largely as we expected. We attribute only a couple of hundred million dollars of our fiscal \u201924 cash flow to beneficial timing related to the large contract unwind. I\u2019ll talk about the impact of the contract unwind on cash flow shortly as part of our guidance. Also this year, we strengthened our balance sheet and achieved our targeted leverage ratio, which resulted in three positive outlook updates from the credit rating agencies. We also continued to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner, returning more than our baseline commitment of capital returned to shareholders through $750 million of share repurchases and $500 million in dividend payments, and we increased our dividend for the 35th year in a row. Now let\u2019s look forward and discuss our updated fiscal \u201925 guidance on Slide 15. Today, we are increasing our fiscal \u201925 EPS guidance to a new range of $7.55 to $7.70. This is an increase from the preliminary guidance during our Q3 call of at least $7.50. Slide 16 shows our fiscal \u201925 outlook for pharma. On revenue, we expect a decline between 4% and 6%, reflecting the nearly $40 billion revenue headwind from the large customer contract expiration. Normalizing for the large customer, fiscal \u201925 revenue growth would be between 15% and 18%. This reflects underlying growth generally consistent with our long-term targeted rate of 10% due to strong overall pharmaceutical demand, as well as significant growth from the on-boarding of new customers and existing customer expansions, primarily in the second half of the year. We are on track to address the segment profit impact of the large contract expiration with this incremental volume, contributions from specialty networks, and additional operational efficiencies. Note that all three of these offsets will have some level of a ramp to them throughout our fiscal \u201925. We expect consistent market dynamics for our generics program to continue. We also expect increased contributions from brand and specialty products, including biosimilars. We are assuming a modest year-over-year headwind related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. On brand manufacturer price increases, we expect an environment generally consistent with the past several years. Summing it all up, we anticipate pharma segment profit growth in the range of 1% to 3%, a testament to the strength and resiliency of this business. It is the case that segment profit growth will be more back half-weighted than usual. We expect first half segment profit to be slightly lower to flat versus the prior year, with profit growth in the back half. Q3 should again be the highest absolute dollar profit quarter for the business. Turning to GMPD on Slide 17, on the top line we expect growth between 3% and 5%, aided by low single digit utilization growth as well as incremental volume from the on-boarding of net new distribution customer wins. On the bottom line, we are reiterating our expectation of approximately $175 million in segment profit for fiscal year \u201925, on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year \u201926 by executing the GMPD improvement plan. The plan is unchanged from what we shared a quarter ago. After successfully offsetting inflation at the end of this year, the annualization of these benefits will be a fiscal year \u201925 tailwind. The team remains focused on continuing to drive Cardinal brand growth through our five-point plan. In fiscal year \u201925, we expect Cardinal brand sales growth between 3% and 5%. Simplification and cost optimization also continue with further opportunities in the pipeline to drive efficiencies and streamline our operations. Recognizing that while GMPD\u2019s plan may be simple, that does not make it easy. We once again expect a back half-weighted profit year in fiscal \u201925, just like fiscal \u201924. The quarterly cadence will be driven by seasonality and the ongoing commercial and operational improvements in the business. Additionally, we expect unfavorable manufacturing cost timing in the first half of the year, which unlike last year includes some start-up costs and timing associated with expanding production at Cardinal Health-owned domestic manufacturing plants to enhance our supply chain resiliency. Q1 should be the low point of the year due to these factors. Last year\u2019s updated Q1 shows $12 million of profit, and this year we expect Q1 to increase to up to $20 million, with sequential improvements thereafter. Turning to other on Slide 18, for each of nuclear, at-home solution and OptiFreight, we expect profit to be aided by the continued strength in demand, execution of our growth strategies, and benefits from our increased prioritization of these businesses with investments. Collectively, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth of approximately 10%, with all three businesses contributing to these targets. Stepping back, we are pleased to see anticipated profit growth across all of our operating segments in fiscal year \u201925. Moving below the line, we expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $170 million. The large year-over-year increase continues to be driven by lower average cash balances, lower short term investment rates on our cash, and higher rates on our debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities. We continue to expect our fiscal year \u201925 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. With our near term GMPD value creation initiatives, we have increased our fiscal year \u201925 share repurchase expectations beyond our baseline to $750 million on the year, leading to a share count guidance of approximately 243 million shares. Finally, we expect fiscal year \u201925 adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the Q1 negative impacts from the large contract unwind as well as quarter and day of the week timing. While these dynamics will significantly affect our cash flow in Q1, our strong investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations and continue making strategic investments in the business consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework. To close, fiscal year \u201924 was a standout year filled with notable milestones. With adjusted EPS growth of 29% and adjusted free cash flow of nearly $4 billion, the Cardinal team delivered. With six weeks of fiscal \u201925 behind us, I\u2019m pleased to say that the team is managing adeptly. Between the leaders we have throughout the organization, our dedicated team working tirelessly to serve our customers, and our clear strategy, we are confident that we will deliver once again. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks Aaron. Now I\u2019ll go deeper into our strategic priorities, beginning with pharma and specialty solutions, where we remain focused on building upon our strong core foundation and expanding in specialty. Everything we do starts with the customer. Recently we hosted our 32nd annual retail business conference, the largest in the industry, bringing together 5,000 attendees from across the country. As the trusted partner to retail pharmacy, we understand the critical role retail independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities as they continue to expand their services as community healthcare destinations and demonstrate their remarkable value and resiliency. We continue to invest in our full suite of clinical, business and reimbursement solutions to support our customers and provide industry advocacy to empower retail pharmacy, now and into the future. Our consumer health logistics center slated to open in 2025 will offer a comprehensive selection of over-the-counter medications, treatments and diagnostic solutions. Additionally, our new vaccine alliance program offers cost savings and other benefits from participating manufacturers to help pharmacies engage more patients and expand their immunization programs. We are constantly evaluating ways to bring innovative solutions to our pharmacy and manufacturer partners through the breadth of our offerings and capabilities. As part of that commitment and in collaboration with CVS Health, we have formed Averon, a joint venture to source biosimilars. Averon builds upon our company\u2019s successful partnerships like Red Oak Sourcing with similar overall objectives for biosimilars. Simply put, we are increasing access to additional therapy options that will provide more choice for patients at a lower cost. Averon began by contracting a couple of products, including Humira biosimilars, and we see opportunities for the program to expand over time. Continuing in specialty, we\u2019re pleased with how quickly specialty networks has integrated with our business, and we continue to be impressed with the PPS analytics platform\u2019s insights generation capabilities and the team\u2019s clinical, technology and operational expertise. As expected, we are leveraging specialty networks\u2019 demonstrated capabilities in neurology, the largest area of its fully integrated model, to enhance our offering in oncology. The fully integrated specialty networks market offering is directly aligned with our strategy for Navista, our oncology practice alliance providing advanced technology and services. Over the course of the last year, we\u2019ve built a world-class Navista team consisting of industry experts, defined our offerings and go-to-market strategy, and completed our foundational technology build. The Navista team is engaging with an active pipeline of customers across the oncology marketplace, demonstrating to community oncologists how Navista can help them remain independent for good. Upstream with manufacturers, our leading specialty 3PL has continued its track record of growing faster than market with nearly 20% growth during the year. We\u2019re leveraging these services as part of our comprehensive offering that further facilitates the commercialization and delivery of critical cell and gene therapies to providers and patients. Our new advanced therapy solutions innovation center features a specialized deep frozen storage suite to handle the logistical challenges associated with cell and gene therapies. Additionally, the dedicated space provides opportunities for collaboration and improved process design supporting the ordering, invoicing and accounts receivable process for pharmaceutical products. Across classes of trade, our commitment to service and solutions-oriented commercial approach has resonated with customers. A new health system customer on-boarding that we recently completed and a few in the earlier phases of ramp-up are going smoothly, and we expect over $10 billion in total incremental revenue in fiscal year \u201925 from committed customer wins and expansions. Turning to GMPD, when we originally introduced the former medical improvement plan, we consistently highlighted that the first key to turning around the performance of the business was addressing the significant impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints on our business. Our team got to work with urgency, executing various mitigation actions to cover the significant operating losses we incurred. Fast forward to today, after two years of hard work, the GMPD business is on solid ground. We delivered an approximate $240 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit in fiscal year \u201924. We exited the year successfully offsetting the gross impact of inflation. We\u2019ve seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year segment revenue growth and four consecutive quarters of Cardinal Health brand volume growth. We grew Cardinal Health brand revenue 3% overall for the year and 4% in the U.S. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution remains up over 20 points from its pandemic low, and we\u2019re successfully retaining key distribution customers along with some recent wins. As we continue to dive into the business through our portfolio review, it\u2019s clear there are still significant opportunities to capture. I\u2019ll highlight a few. First, as Aaron mentioned, our progress on inflation mitigation in fiscal year \u201924 will annualize and be a significant year-over-year tailwind to our results next year, even with the slight headwind expected from the recent cost increases in international freight. Between the actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our resiliency, the diversity of our global supply chain, and some offsets across our broader portfolio of commodities, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to effectively mitigate supply chain inflation. Second, Cardinal Health brand leading indicators remain positive and continue to predict an acceleration in growth. We\u2019ve seen a healthy overall utilization environment for a number of quarters now and our five-point plan continues to produce encouraging results. Third, the disciplined execution of our simplification strategy has driven improved operational performance. With the business stabilized and only recent turned free cash flow positive, we see opportunities to drive targeted working capital improvements over the next two years. Additionally, we can broaden our simplification efforts such as further optimizing our real estate and geographic footprint, while always prioritizing the needs of our customers as our north star. Our team is energized to execute on the next phase of the improvement journey focused on commercial excellence and continued simplification to create additional value for our customers and shareholders. In nuclear and precision health solutions, our leading positioning with 130 nuclear pharmacies and 30 PET sites across the country feeds our differentiated ability to partner with manufacturers in order to bring cutting edge therapies to patients exactly when they need them. Our excitement continues to build around the opportunities to improve patient lives through the use of precision medicine, which we have been investing into heavily with our center for theranostics advancement. We\u2019re seeing the results with our theranostics business growing over 20% in fiscal year \u201924, driven by strong demand for prostate cancer theranostics products such as [indiscernible]. In fiscal year \u201925, we expect similar theranostics growth and will continue to invest to meet the growing pipeline of opportunities, which includes cardiology and neurology, but overall is largely dominated by oncology. As an example, we will be expanding our support of novel prostate radioligand therapies with Novartis\u2019 Pluvicto in fiscal year \u201925. We are also investing in increasing our cyclotron capacity and PET manufacturing geographic footprint to meet increasing demand for PET diagnostics, with a majority of emerging radiotherapeutics requiring a companion PET scan. Fiscal year \u201924 was a foundational year for our $2.9 billion at-home solutions business as we laid the groundwork for future growth and efficiency. This business continues to grow revenue faster than market, not only aided by care moving into the home but also our team\u2019s commercial execution. To drive operating leverage, we\u2019ve been investing our technology capabilities such as new warehouses with state of the art automation. Just last month, we opened our brand-new 350,000 square foot warehouse in South Carolina featuring the fastest order fulfillment system in the market. This system is also operational in our central Ohio facility and planned for the new Texas distribution center we\u2019d previously announced and expect to open in 2025. We\u2019re seeing fruits from our investments with our fill rates currently the highest they\u2019ve been in over three years and our patient net promoter score up over 16% year-over-year. The OptiFreight logistics team delivered this year with exceptional performance. Our TotalVue insights platform continues to help customers uncover shipping inefficiencies and optimize delivery through data-driven insights. As a result, our customer loyalty index is at an all-time high. In fiscal year \u201925, to put it simply, we expect to continue our track record of great execution, helping our customers expand and bringing on new customers to benefit from our program and value. Across the enterprise, we are confident in the Cardinal team to continue our momentum and deliver our targeted growth in fiscal year \u201925 and beyond. Before I wrap up, the former CEO in me can\u2019t help but acknowledge our team\u2019s tremendous progress on cash flow this year. With the record results in fiscal year \u201924, we\u2019re positioned to exceed the adjusted free cash flow expectations we outlined at investor day with at least $7 billion over the fiscal \u201924 to \u201926 period, even despite the large contract expiration. We possess the financial flexibility to continue investing our business, returning capital to shareholders and maximizing long term shareholder value creation. In summary, fiscal year \u201924 was another great year and we are excited to continue driving our company and healthcare forward. I want to thank our dedicated employees who serve our customers and continue our work to be healthcare\u2019s most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Hollar. [Operator instructions] Today\u2019s first question is coming from Lisa Gill, calling from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Thanks very much, and good morning. Thanks for all the details, Jason. I just want to better understand two things. One, nice driver of the margin going into next year, you had originally said roughly 1%, now you\u2019re talking 1% to 3%. I think you called out a couple of things - the specialty network, new customer, cost mitigation, but I\u2019m just curious, especially in the new customer, is there anything unique about that contract or anything else that you would call out as we think about the margin improvement throughout \u201925? Aaron Alt : Lisa, good morning, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about it. We are really pleased to raise our guide for the pharma business for fiscal \u201925 - it really reflects our continued confidence in the team and continued confidence in the resiliency of that business, notwithstanding some of the puts and takes that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of quarters. I\u2019ll touch on the profile in a second, but I do want to emphasize on the revenue side of the house from a guidance perspective that we guided down 4% to 6% all-in, reflecting the $40 million headwind on the low margin contract non-renewal, but it\u2019s really up 15% to 18% on an adjusted basis if you take out the impact of that customer loss. Within that 15% to 18% is $10 billion of new revenue, new customers and expansions of service with existing customers - that\u2019s on top of a 10% underlying growth with the existing business, and so from that you can tell that we are growing the portfolio and doing what we said we were going to do with our existing customers and adding on both new customers and expansions with existing customers to get to that revenue base. That supports the increase in guide, the 1% to 3% on the profitability side of the house. The thing we called out during the earnings call is the consistent market dynamics, it\u2019s the generic volume growing, the low single-digit growth in core and the high single-digit growth in specialty, the strong overall Rx demand. There\u2019s a lot of things going on, but we are confident in our plans as we carry forward. Now, we don\u2019t comment on the margin profile of any particular customer, particularly in the context of a new customer, and we were delighted to announce formally the Publix win today in our earnings release. I\u2019m not going to comment on their profitability, but I will observe that we have publicly commented on the low margin nature of the business that we\u2019ve lost, and that certainly doesn\u2019t hurt us as we carry forward. Jason, anything you would add to that? Jason Hollar : No, nothing to add. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Eric Percher calling from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Eric Percher : Thank you. I think it\u2019s fair to say there was some concern coming into the quarter on the increase in macro freight trends and other input costs, and I know you mentioned you\u2019re able to offset that. Can you give us a sense of how this looked to you in terms of the size of that increase versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, was it material, and how it looked under the current or new contracts versus legacy contracts, and the ability to pass that along to your customers? Jason Hollar : Sure, thanks for the question, Eric. I think it\u2019s important to just go back in time a little bit, this last 12 months. A year ago when we were sitting here, certainly the freight costs had gone all the way back down to historic levels, so we were enjoying--really, the run-up had come all the way back down, and it was the beginning of the calendar year, so in our third quarter when the Red Sea issues first began, and that\u2019s when we saw the first spike, and the reason I remind you of that is that first spike was known come springtime, when we gave our initial guidance for GMPD, and so we knew about that first step-up already, and that\u2019s been factored into the guidance from day one. Yes, there have been further increases since then, but when you look at the combined two increases, the two different steps, first in January, then in the spring, they still are woefully short of where we were a couple of years ago when the whole supply chain was under pressure, where even when we were spending two, three times the current level, we were having difficulty in actually getting reasonable service. So yes, the costs are higher, but not nearly as high as they used to be, and most importantly is the supply chain is functioning a lot more efficiently than it was before. Long way of saying, Eric, that yes, there is a little bit of an increase here, it\u2019s something we monitor and manage very, very tightly, but it\u2019s not the point where it requires widespread price adjustments accordingly, at least not yet. In addition to that, it\u2019s important that we look at the overall inflationary environment, and we talked about this a couple of years ago. At the peak, we had a lot of oil and petroleum-based products, including fuel and other type of freight, that was also a big issue. Those are actually a little bit softer in terms of the cost, so overall net-net, we\u2019re managing through it better than we have before, and overall we have some puts and takes that are all very manageable. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate the pricing necessary within that, but at this stage we haven\u2019t had to exercise that lever to near the extent that we did in the past. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, our next question will be coming from Michael Cherny calling from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open. Michael Cherny : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe if I could dive a little bit more into the underlying pharma growth, if you can. You did a good job outlining some of the moving pieces on lost contract versus new. Is there any way you can give us a bit more color on where you expect the profit streams to lie from specialty, and then also a bit more color on the COVID hangover, just so that we can have a better understanding. I guess maybe the simple, straightforward question is where will you be on an exit run rate on pharma growth exiting the year, given all the moving pieces you have to start the year? Jason Hollar : Yes, let me try to address a few of those pieces. Specialty is absolutely a key part of this story and why we still anticipate being able to grow this business next year. We highlighted in our comments that in fiscal \u201924 for the year, we saw another year of 14% growth. You may recall at our investor day last year, the specialty business CAGR over the prior three years was anticipated at that time to be 14% as well, so another year of strong growth driven by the widespread investments that we have made and continue to make. We talked today about a couple of interesting growth drivers for the future, whether it\u2019s our advanced therapy solutions business, the new venture with CVS for Averson focused on biosimilars. Biosimilars in general has been a rising tide type of benefit over the last several years, and of course then our acquisition of specialty networks, which closed in March and has an eight, nine-month type of year-over-year benefit tailwind, so these are all areas that are driving our specialty business to some degree in fiscal \u201924, but they\u2019re all examples of where we would expect that to continue to grow over fiscal \u201925 to help mitigate for that contract non-renewal, that we think while that growth will be slower in \u201925 due to that. I also made the comment in the remarks that even in spite of this overall revenue reduction for the enterprise for the pharma segment and the impact of that contract non-renewal, we still expect our specialty business to grow in fiscal \u201925 in spite of that. That tells you that our run rate as we lap fiscal \u201925 and that non-renewal, we would anticipate it to be very consistent with the long term algorithm that we\u2019ve highlighted in the past, which from a profit perspective has been defined as low single-digit type of profit growth for our PD core business and double-digit growth for specialty, so we\u2019ll continue to look at other opportunities to invest organically, as well as inorganically to continue to feed that growth. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question today will be coming from Erin Wright calling from Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. In terms of the fiscal \u201925 guide, are there any changes in terms of how you were thinking just the Optum unwind in terms of stranded costs or otherwise, and just given the building contributions, whether it\u2019s specialty networks or the new customer win with that Optum offset, I guess, how should we think about that cadence in terms of the split of first half versus second half, or however you want to define it, on an EPS perspective, given some of those moving pieces in the first half? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes, I\u2019ll have Aaron walk through some of the cadence [indiscernible], to your question, but I wanted to stress just upfront, what you should have heard from these messages are very, very similar words and phrases that we used last quarter. The plan is unchanged. Of course, we get a little bit smarter, we sharpen our pencils a little bit and we get a better understanding of where our exit rate is for \u201924, but all the factors that we are talking about today with this business are very similar to what we walked through in the past, and of course all the investments that we made this last year. Aaron, a few thoughts on the cadence? Aaron Alt : Sure, so the way to think about it is Optum was an existing customer with us until the end of our Q4, and you can see the results in Q4, we don\u2019t need to go deeper on that. But what did also happen in Q4 was us being incredibly planful around the impacts to our operations, as well as to our financials of that customer unwind. We\u2019ve talked in the past and we talked during our last earnings call around the three offsetting actions, the contribution of specialty networks, of course the new customer win, the expansion with existing customers as well as further cost optimization opportunities, and we\u2019re pleased the team got on it, got ahead of it, and they\u2019ve already been executing in that respect, and so the guidance we\u2019re able to provide today, we view as relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve provided in Q3, but with an additional degree of confidence because the plans are behind us and now we\u2019re acting in that way. The non-renewal will impact our Q1- there\u2019s no way to avoid that. They were a large, low margin customer, and as we\u2019ve talked about, the new customers coming on board are largely back half-loaded, and so we will have a timing difference relative to prior years and that will impact certainly our revenue and profitability timing over the course of the year. There\u2019s also a cash impact, right? The unwind of the negative working capital position there is a Q1 impact for us and a key reason why we are carefully monitoring our cash flow during the first quarter, of course balanced with the fact that we are delighted with the strong adjusted free cash flow and the strong cash balance at the end of our Q4. Look - on balance, the cost optimization is already in play, specialty networks is already in play, and we continue to work on the customer expansions and the new customer on-boarding, and we will make that successful as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today will be coming from Allen Lutz calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Aaron. Can you talk about how gross profit performed relative to your internal model, and then are you seeing any impact from insulin pricing changes or Humira share shifts to gross profit dollar growth? Then are there any insights or thoughts around a biosimilar launch for Stelara? Thanks. Aaron Alt : I\u2019ll start. Look, I would observe that our gross margin progression went largely as we anticipated over the course of the quarter and the year. We have a very complicated business managing between the various parts, and no real surprises from my chair in that way. The second part of the question was--? Jason Hollar : Yes, let me take that. It was related to, I think, just the general impact of insulin pricing, but there\u2019s also the Humira element there, so it\u2019s probably a couple different questions. Within the quarter, we did, as Aaron had highlighted before, we saw of course the ongoing benefit of the GLP-1 growth, but we did have a similar offset as it relates to the pricing change for the WAC insulin adjustments that happened at the beginning of the calendar year. Until we get through the second quarter of fiscal \u201925, we\u2019d anticipate there to be a bit of an offset related to that price change. There was also a question around Humira and, I assume, just the biosimilar type of migration. We see that it\u2019s started to move a little bit more. Certainly some of the actions that CVS has done more broadly in the marketplace seem to have moved things along a little bit further. It\u2019s still fairly low penetration throughout the broad industry, but generally speaking, we have seen that start to pick up a little bit, I wouldn\u2019t say meaningfully, within the quarter, maybe a little bit even afterwards, but it\u2019s still at fairly low penetration rates. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so focused on biosimilars and with our joint venture with Averon, is just to continue to look for ways to increase access for patients that need that therapy at an affordable cost, so we\u2019ll continue to do our part there. Next question please. Operator : Our next question today will be coming from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just trying to triangulate some of the things we\u2019ve learned this quarter about the GMPD business. You\u2019re talking about winning more share of pocket. We\u2019re seeing you make investments in domestic plants, we\u2019ve seen shipping costs go higher. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen Owens & Minor and Medline put up stronger than expected results, and McKesson and Henry Schein put up worse than expected results and guide lower in those segments. Is it maybe fair to say that you and your peers on the hospital side are moving downstream at all to try to capture greater percentage of the health system business that\u2019s not just in the acute care side? Is that a trend that\u2019s happening, and I guess the second part of that is the investments in domestic driven by the idea that now you could be more--because shipping costs are higher, costs overseas, tariffs are coming, that the domestic manufacturing can be more competitive in a price basis versus importing? Jason Hollar : Yes, so it\u2019s certainly true that GMPD is more acute focused customers, and we do benefit from the migration towards more of an ASC model. We do not participate widely in physician offices, so that\u2019s an element. It\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve called out as broad trends, so I don\u2019t have much more to go on there, other than on a same store sales basis, we\u2019re seeing the utilization fairly consistent this past year, generally speaking, that low single-digit type of range, so we are seeing that there\u2019s like-for-like growth. What we\u2019ve highlighted fairly consistently is that this last year was--or the end of \u201923, beginning of \u201924 was the inflection point for us. We were not growing with the market at that point. Over the course of \u201924, we\u2019ve largely grown with the market, plus or minus a point here or there, so very consistent with that low single-digit type of growth over--especially after our first quarter. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s widespread shifts there, but we definitely have an ASC presence that we do think we benefit from, but I wouldn\u2019t call that a main driver of what we\u2019re looking at. In terms of the investments we\u2019re making, we did call out some domestic investments, but they\u2019re not limited to domestic. We believe in a very diversified, competitive geographic footprint. We\u2019ve stressed that specifically we don\u2019t have manufacturing, direct manufacturing in China - that\u2019s one of the related questions here as it relates to certainly the ongoing tariff risk, and I can also let you know that we only source less than 10% of our total Cardinal Health branded product in China, so specifically to China, we don\u2019t have a large exposure. But we do have exposure beyond China, and Asia and near-shore Central, South America, we believe a diversified, broad supply base is important, as well as a domestic footprint. We have increased our investments across the supply chain to improve the resiliency, and there\u2019s a couple of areas within the U.S. specifically - you\u2019ve seen some of the tariffs related to syringes is a specific area of focus, and we happen to have that capability in the United States. That\u2019s just one example of where we\u2019re really doubling down on that investment. So yes, costs and freight are always a consideration - you know, we build a financial model behind all that and we look at the risks, but on this particular example, one example of where we\u2019re really leaning in on that investment, that\u2019s more about just ensuring our customers get the product they need. This is more of a volume opportunity than a pure cost and margin opportunity, so you\u2019ve got to look at all those factors. Next question, please. Operator : Yes sir. The next question today will be coming from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask quickly about Medicaid disenrollment and the extent you\u2019ve seen impacts in consumer or channel behavior as a result of that, and if so, could you specify where and possibly quantify those impacts? I think specifically, I\u2019m probably tagging onto Kevin\u2019s question and wondering if some of the shifts we\u2019re seeing in the medical segment could be related to roughly 25 million people coming off of Medicaid here in the last several months. Thank you very much. Jason Hollar : Yes, thanks for the question, Eric. Again, I think my answer is going to be fairly similar to what I said before, but in a different context. We have a very broad base of customers, very broad base of payors behind those customers, so we don\u2019t have necessarily even the insight all the time as to where those reimbursements are coming from. The same store sales type of information, what we see more broadly is just not a lot of fluctuations and variations, and we\u2019re not talking again of any type of growth rate above and beyond what we believe that underlying utilization is. Generally speaking, if there are some of those trends, at this stage I\u2019m not seeing that as a meaningful driver to where our business is going. Matt Sims : Next question please. Operator : Yes sir, our next question today will be coming from George Hill calling in from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. A two-parter. Number one, I guess Aaron, would you be willing to provide any more color on earnings cadence expectations for the year, particularly Q1 and Q2 versus the back half, given the large number of moving pieces? Then a quick one for Jason is we know you\u2019ve got the new business coming on, we\u2019ve got the United loss. Would just love an update on the competitive environment in drug distribution. This has been a pretty stable space for a while now. Just want to make sure that nothing\u2019s changed, or nothing should be changing in the dynamic that we should be aware of. Thanks. Aaron Alt : I\u2019ll start. I would just observe that we\u2019re being very thoughtful in the planning we\u2019re doing for the year, given the number of moving pieces we have both within the pharma business and within the GMPD business, and of course keeping an eye on the three growth businesses within other. Within pharma, what we\u2019ve reference is first half from a cadence perspective will be slightly down to flat versus prior year. That\u2019s only natural given the customer unwind and the back ended nature of the new customer on-boarding. Largely, the drivers within the pharma business are consistent with what would have been true in previous years - Q3 will be where we see the branded inflation rolling through, and so not a lot of different news there that I would call out. From a med perspective, we\u2019re very focused on executing against the plan. We\u2019ve tried to be transparent every quarter about how we\u2019re doing and where we see it going, which is why we were purposeful in calling out Q1 specifically as we push ahead. We\u2019ve had great success during fiscal year \u201925 and accomplished what we told you we were going to do, and we plan to do that again. Just want to be clear that we are investing in the business and there are some near term Q1 drivers that will make that rough number, what we call the up to $20 million as we carry forward. There\u2019s no magic here, though - I want to be clear. The plan and the cadence is generally consistent with how we\u2019ve described the GMPD improvement plan in the past. Of course, we have the benefit of the inflation mitigation now lapping as we push ahead, and of course we can\u2019t forget the important topic of seasonality from a Q4 to Q1 perspective - we\u2019ve called that out before, and that\u2019s why you see a dip from the great results in Q4 into Q1. Jason Hollar : As it relates to the second question, I\u2019ll say what I said before - we\u2019re 1% industry, so it\u2019s competitive but stable. I would say that the vast majority of contracts don\u2019t change hands period to period. These couple, several that have that more notable, there\u2019s been several that have long term five-year types of agreements, so every five years there is the chance, opportunity or risk for that to occur, but again I\u2019ll just stress the vast majority don\u2019t. We feel really good about our positioning, competitive positioning. We know we\u2019re competitive, we know that our message and our work and our results resonate with our customers. We\u2019re very much focused on that experience, the service levels, the value initiatives and propositions behind it, the tools and platforms. We\u2019ve talked about our InteLogix and our Atrix platforms for health systems as one example of not just going at them with price but going at them with value, and having true value components to those offerings, and we feel really good about where that positioning is, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to offset to the degree that we have. Matt Sims : Next question please. Operator : Yes sir, the next question will be coming from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead. Anna Grasinsky : Hi guys. This is Anna Grasinsky [ph] on for Stephanie. Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for taking our questions.  I was hoping to hear more about your AI road map. You\u2019ve highlighted AI and machine learning deployments within the InteLogix platform, and just wondering how we should think about additional AI use cases to improve efficiency and potential cost savings. Jason Hollar : Yes, thanks for the question. It\u2019s broad-based, it\u2019s varied. We don\u2019t call it out in every call in all areas, but it\u2019s so broad, it really is everywhere. It\u2019s in the core of how we operate. Examples of what we talked about today, without using the phrase AI, especially networks - you know, their PPS analytics is a great example of taking that data, electronic medical records and synthesizing that for manufacturers, as well as providers, and getting actionable insights. I mean, that is AI. When you look at some of the automation I\u2019m commented on in our at-home solutions network, this is now over 25% of our sites just in the last 12 to 18 months. We\u2019re launching a new footprint that is bringing in technology and automation in various forms into the manufacturing--or I\u2019m sorry, into the distribution setting to be even more innovative, even more efficient and productive. As you mentioned, those other platforms, InteLogix, Atrix, working with Palantir and other partners to create value, and then I\u2019m not even getting into the more basic use cases like customer service and back office. I guess I don\u2019t want to just hit the same drumbeat everyone else is. What we\u2019re trying to do in our communication is get beyond the buzzwords and really talk about the essence of where we\u2019re driving our business, and we feel really good about that, and it\u2019s definitely [indiscernible]. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes sir, we\u2019ll now move to Elizabeth Anderson calling from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson : Hey guys, thanks so much for the questions. I was wondering if you could maybe expand on your prior comments about two things. One, you talked about customer expansions a couple of times across the course of the call. Can you talk about what those are - generally speaking, are they people moving from pharma to increase in medical, are they moving across different pharma categories? How do we think about that? Then if we think about the cost cutting, obviously there\u2019s some right-sizing for the contract change that you guys mentioned, but how do we think about some of the more--it sounds like some of those changes you\u2019re putting through are sort of more structural, so how do we think about the long term benefits of those going forward? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yes, I\u2019ll start. On the customer expansions, these are existing customer relationships where we are already a primary distributor for them, and they are expanding their footprint, whether it\u2019s acquisitions or just taking on more of the business themselves, and we\u2019re supporting their growth, so it\u2019s an existing relationship and expanding upon that, so it\u2019s committed in that sense, where we\u2019re already there, and you can use BioPlus as one of the examples of what I\u2019m talking about there. Perhaps Aaron, you can go into a little bit more detail on the [indiscernible]? Aaron Alt : Sure, so as I commented earlier, the team did a great job of assessing our opportunities in the face of the customer non-renewal, but I guess I would go back and point out that at the end of the day, we operate a 1% operating margin business, so it\u2019s important for us to always be mindful of the cost structure around us, but with a north star of how do we continue to ensure our customer service. We have been pleased that the reviews we undertook during Q4, the actions we identified will help us to offset the near term impact of customer loss, but more importantly they create a more efficient operational structure for us, and the changes are broad ranging across the enterprise with that north star ensuring we continue our customer service focus as we push ahead. Many of the changes have already been implemented and we\u2019re operating in that new framework already. We continue to assess what are the productive opportunities, and I also would emphasize that the ideas for these changes are coming from our broader teams as they look around and say, okay, how can we operate better in support of our existing customers and the new customers on the line. Matt Sims : Next question please. Operator : Yes sir, we\u2019ll now move to Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a couple about the restatement to GMPD. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the higher GMPD base post-restatement in 2024 doesn\u2019t\u2019 change the run rate, because you\u2019re removing out-of-period items. Is that the right way to think about it, so there\u2019s no comparability issue with the $175 million target on that higher base? I guess that\u2019s the first question. Then based on the restatement that you provided, I think the cumulative profit in the business from 2022 to 2024 is $25 million or $30 million higher than previous. I\u2019m just trying to understand why those things don\u2019t net out if we\u2019re thinking about timing issues here. Thank you. Aaron Alt : Yes, appreciate the question. The answer is there is no comparability issue. The 175 is unimpacted by the revisions that we provided in the financials today. The revisions we provided were for the three-year period. There will be--there is an impact of shifting of income or expense into the prior periods as well, which is why you\u2019re not seeing direct comparability as we carry forward. I do want to emphasize, though, that part of our operation here is building and maintaining a strong [indiscernible] environment, and as we identified the issue in the Edgepark part of our at-home business, which is part of other, it was a revenue recognition issue tied to a business which does less than half a percent of our overall revenue base. We were careful to do the right thing and disclose, and at the same time in partnership with our auditors decided that we would reflect the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from this community and others around comments around non-recurring adjustments in prior periods, etc., and so now we walk into fiscal \u201925 not only with comparability but with a clean set of financials, unimpacted by timing to be able to talk about our progress as we carry forward. Matt Sims : Next question please. Operator : Yes sir, the next question will be coming from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Lucas : Hi, this is Lucas on for Charles. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the other segment. Can you talk about what\u2019s expected from OptiFreight, nuclear and at-home in fiscal \u201925 in terms of growth? Should we be thinking about any of these businesses outperforming the 10% segment target that you\u2019ve set? Aaron Alt : Well from a guidance perspective, we provide guidance for other on an aggregated basis, but I do want you to take away the enthusiasm present in Jason\u2019s comments and his tone of voice around the opportunity we think that each of these three businesses presents to Cardinal Health as we carry forward. The businesses are unique. They are managed differently. We aggregate them from a financial perspective. It\u2019s also the case that we are investing in each of those businesses, we have in \u201924 and we are in \u201925. At-home has recently opened two new distribution points and is investing in automation. OptiFreight has continued to invest in its digital platform and service of its customer experience. The nuclear business, we\u2019ve talked at length about expanding the PET network as well as our excitement about the theranostic opportunities that that business presents. Again, as I go back to the financial guide, part of what you\u2019re seeing in the other basis is we are presenting a consistent picture on an aggregated view, which reflects in some cases we\u2019ll be investing in a year or a month while reaping the benefit in the same year or month from other parts of the portfolio. Jason? Jason Hollar : Yes, I would say the one thing we did clarify in the prior comments is that all three businesses are expected to contribute to that growth in fiscal \u201925, and we are investing--you know, fiscal \u201924 was an especially heavy investment period, but we are continuing to invest across the range. Just one example to put into perspective is we talked a lot about our investments in our nuclear and precision health solutions business. This is a business that we\u2019ve highlighted, theranostics now just with our second phase of expansion that we announced about a year ago, or this last year, and then we also have talked about some PET expansion. From a fiscal \u201924 to \u201926, that\u2019s about $100 million, mainly capital that we\u2019re investing into that business, but it\u2019s representative of the big investments that we\u2019re making in addition to the three different distribution centers in at-home solutions that Aaron had mentioned are very representative of the inputs that we\u2019re putting into these businesses, because we deeply believe in their ability to continue to grow, benefit from the secular trends they each enjoy, but then also reflecting the leadership position we have in each, and that is then further bolstered by these very specific investments. Matt Sims : Next question please. Operator : Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today will be coming from Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a strong quarter. Was hoping to get a bit more detail on Averon. Will that just be serving CVS at this point, and how does that kind of interact with Cordavis, and then are there any purchase obligations or quarterly payments associated with that? Then lastly, when does that agreement renew? Aaron Alt : Okay, so you crammed in about four there. Averon, the first specific question on Averon was--? Jason Hollar : Just broadly speaking, more color. Jason Hollar : Yes, so I referenced it a few different times, so I think maybe there\u2019s a more specific question behind it. Oh - I think the question was, does it just service CVS? The answer is no. It\u2019s a consistent concept as what we did with Red Oak Sourcing, reflecting that we both have different needs, different customers if you will, and can jointly benefit those patients through combining our capabilities in this space, so we would expect to operate it in a similar way, where we have different benefits associated with that. There are--I think what you\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s not the same type of payment structure and schedule that we have for Red Oak Sourcing, kind of equalization payments if you will, so that structure does not exist with this. It is structured quite a bit differently in that regard. Then in terms of--I think there was a renewal question there about CVS, and so the contract goes through--the distribution contract goes through \u201927, and then the Red Oak agreement goes through \u201929, so this is certainly outside of those agreements and it\u2019s very much an example of the type of partnership that we look to have with any and all of our customers in various ways to ensure that we\u2019re thinking about how better to serve those underlying patients. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hollar. We don\u2019t have any further questions, so I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yes, thank you, and thank you all for joining us. In addition the usual pleasantries I have at this point in the call, I do want to step back for just a minute, reflecting that given it\u2019s our year-end as well as additional guidance, I know that there was a lot to digest within this, but I hope that we clarified many of your points today. I do want to end where I started and just re-emphasize those same three key points I had at the very beginning of the commentary today. First of all, we finished the year with terrific momentum. We grew our earnings per share by 29% for both the quarter and the fiscal year. You add that on top of the growth that we saw last year, that\u2019s a nearly 50% increase in our EPS over the last couple of years, driven by performance across the board but really strong performance in our largest, most significant business, our pharma segment, growing despite having some of those impacts in the quarter from that contract unwind. But we\u2019re also seeing very good utilization across the enterprise, whether it\u2019s pharma as well as GMPD. We see that this industry continues to have a lot of need within the marketplace. That in part is driving our GMPD, but really that $240 million improvement that we saw for that business this year is being driven by the successful mitigation of inflation, a long hard journey but we\u2019ve gotten there, and now we\u2019re able to focus on driving the business going forward. Our other businesses, we\u2019re seeing robust demand across the board, utilization but secular trends as well. Really excited about the ongoing growth there - double digit 10% growth in 2025 while continuing to invest in the business. Cash flow - really strong, not only $4 billion nearly this year but when you take last year and this year in combination, that\u2019s nearly $7 billion that position us very well for financial flexibility going forward. All right, the second point was because of that momentum, we feel very confident about our fiscal \u201925, and that\u2019s why we raised our guidance, both in our largest business with pharma but also driving EPS growth in fiscal \u201925, despite that customer transition. Then thirdly and lastly, we\u2019re doing all that operational and cash flow focus while also driving our strategy going forward, optimizing our portfolio, very consistent transparent dialog we\u2019ve had with you. This management team is focused on those key priorities and will continue to communicate. We\u2019re excited about the progress across a number of areas that we talked about, whether it\u2019s furthering our partnership with our largest customer or the ongoing integration of our largest acquisition of specialty networks that we\u2019ve done in quite some time, and we\u2019re well positioned to continue to grow the business even in spite of any of the headwinds that we\u2019ve identified. Of course, behind all that, we will continue to responsibly prioritize shareholder value creation, and we\u2019ve communicated some additional near term actions specifically within the GMPD business today, and that is translating to even more opportunistic share repurchases in fiscal year \u201925. So a lot there, but a lot to be excited about, and we appreciate your time and attention, and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect. Have a good day, and goodbye.",

My name is George, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded, and for the duration of the call, your lines will be in listen-only mode. However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Matt Sims, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Sims : Welcome to this morning's Cardinal Health first quarter fiscal '25 earnings conference call, and thank you for joining us.

For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit questions to one per participant, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Overall, Cardinal Health delivered a terrific start to fiscal '25 with strong operational and financial performance, led by Pharma and Specialty Solutions. The ongoing strength and resiliency of our largest and most significant business was evident, delivering 16% segment profit growth, reflecting the team's advanced preparations and excellent execution in managing through the previously communicated large customer transition. We continue to operate in a stable industry environment with positive utilization trends underpinning our growth. We saw particularly strong and broad-based pharmaceutical demand this quarter across Brand, Specialty, Consumer Health and our Generics program. We are pleased to again support our customers with commercial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in preparation for the fall immunization season. And as I alluded to, the team executed our customer transition plans with urgency, realigning operational processes to address inefficiencies, facilitate the ongoing growth of the business, and support new customer implementations. In GMPD, while the Q1 financial results were below our expectations due to some unanticipated health and welfare costs that Aaron will cover in detail, our team continues to make progress against the GMPD Improvement Plan, which is unchanged, and take actions to enhance our supply chain resiliency. We're confident in our plans to accelerate the performance of the GMPD business over the next two years, while also continuing our near-term value-creation focus, as we outlined last quarter. Across our Other businesses, Nuclear, at-Home and OptiFreight, we continue to be encouraged by the strong demand and underlying performance we are seeing as these businesses continue to expand and benefit from positive industry trends. In summary, we're pleased to be in a position to raise our enterprise guidance for fiscal '25 after the first quarter. Our business is strong and we're confident as we look ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail. Aaron Alt : Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Q1 delivered an excellent start to Cardinal Health's fiscal 2025 with outstanding results from the Pharma segment, accompanied by solid operational performance from GMPD and the businesses included in Other. As an enterprise, we grew operating earnings by 12% and EPS by 9%, despite the recent customer transition. At the same time, the team adeptly managed through and anticipated negative working capital unwind, over-delivering on our Q1 cash flow expectations and enabling us to continue to both invest in the business and execute on an early accelerated share repurchase program. With the solid start to the year, I am delighted to share the headline that we are raising our EPS guidance to an EPS range of $7.75 to $7.90, and raising our adjusted free cash flow outlook for fiscal '25 to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. More on that shortly. Let's review the results, starting with Slide 4. Total company revenue decreased 4% to $52 billion, better than we expected. Adjusting for the customer transition, total company revenue increased 15% versus the prior year, reflecting our strong organic revenue growth across the rest of our business. We also started to successfully onboard the first of the new customers that make up the over $10 billion of incremental revenue in Pharma, that we've referenced in our guidance for the year. Total company gross margin increased 9%, driven by positive trends in both Brands and Generics in the Pharma segment. While we tightly controlled discretionary spending during the quarter, on the face of our financials, SG&A grew by $91 million or 8% versus prior year. Approximately half of this increase was driven by incremental health and welfare employee costs. This included substantially higher employee plan utilization costs, both numbers of claims and cost per claim, as well as a one-time catch up charge resulting from our third-party actuary on whom we rely notifying us of a mistake in the calculation of our health and welfare plan liabilities from prior years. Even with that impact, we delivered operating earnings of $625 million, 12% higher than last year. Moving below the line, interest and other increased $15 million to $27 million, primarily driven by lower interest income due to the anticipated lower cash balances. Our first quarter effective tax rate finished at 23%, up 2 percentage points due to the non-repetition of some positive discrete items in the prior year. As a result of our share repurchases, Q1 average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 2% lower than a year ago. The net result for Q1 was EPS of $1.88, growth of 9%. Now, turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma and Specialty Solutions on Slide 5. First quarter revenue decreased 5% to $48 billion due to the impact of the customer transition. Excluding that, revenue increased 16%, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. This included 5 percentage points of revenue growth from GLP-1 sales. During Q1, we saw strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, Brand, Specialty, Consumer Health and Generics and from our largest customers. Segment profit increased 16% to $530 million in the first quarter, driven by a higher contribution from Brand and Specialty Products, including a favorable impact from the earlier seasonal launch of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and positive generics program performance. This more than offset the profit impact from the customer transition. In Specialty, we saw strong broad-based performance across Specialty distribution and Biopharma Solutions. Notably, Specialty Networks contributed to this performance as expected, and we are pleased with the progress on the integration. With COVID-19 vaccines recall last year, the FDA's original approval for commercial distribution came on September 11th and our demand peaked in October. This year, we've seen distribution peak within the first quarter. While the demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the second quarter is difficult to predict, trends tell us that we should continue to expect a modest headwind for the full year with the tailwind we saw in Q1 more than offset by lower year-over-year COVID-19 vaccine sales in Q2. This overall impact is consistent with our prior guidance for the year. Our Generics program continued to see volume growth coupled with consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak. We also need to give our team significant credit for planning ahead and executing quickly on our plans to optimize our cost structure and operations following the customer transition. We found incremental opportunities to improve our overall business as a result of the flexibility created by the contract transition. So overall, we are very proud of the Pharma team navigating a large, complex change to the business, while delivering a tremendous quarter of 16% segment profit growth in Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions. Turning to the GMPD segment on Slide 6. Revenue increased 3% in Q1 to $3.1 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. The solid operational progress made in the quarter was obscured by a $17 million year-over-year increase in the previously mentioned health and welfare costs and resulted in GMPD segment profit decreasing to $8 million in Q1. As previewed last quarter, our results were also impacted by increased manufacturing costs, including some startup costs related to expanding domestic manufacturing to enhance our supply chain resiliency, which we expect to also impact Q2. On the positive, an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives and growth from existing customers, mostly offset the decline in the quarter, and we also again saw year-over-year growth in Cardinal brand volumes during the quarter. Finishing with the businesses reported in Other, as seen on Slide 7. First quarter revenue increased 13% to $1.2 billion due to growth across all three businesses; at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics. I'm pleased with the underlying performance of all three of our businesses and other, as they collectively grew segment profit in the quarter by 8%, driven by the performance of OptiFreight Logistics. OptiFreight had another strong quarter, as demand for healthcare logistics, technology and services continues to grow. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash position of $2.9 billion, which includes $200 million earmarked for the November debt maturity with an additional $200 million to be paid through the time deposits held in prepaid assets and other on the balance sheet. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $1.4 billion for the quarter, better than our expectations and, as guided, reflected the large contract unwind and the unfavorable [quarter-end day-of-week] (ph) timing we previewed on our Q4 call. During the first quarter, we continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. We invested $90 million in CapEx back into the businesses to drive organic growth. We returned approximately $500 million to shareholders through the share repurchase and dividends, including a $375 million accelerated share repo program. We continue to invest in Specialty by reaching an agreement to acquire Integrated Oncology Network for $1.1 billion, a deal which is not yet closed. Jason will elaborate on that shortly. Now, for our updated fiscal '25 guidance on Slide 9, beginning with the enterprise. After the strong start to the year, we are raising our fiscal '25 EPS guidance to the range of $7.75 to $7.90, a $0.20 increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $7.55 to $7.70, primarily reflecting our improved Pharma segment profit expectations. We are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We are also adjusting our guidance for our individual segments, as seen on Slide 10. For Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, we are improving our revenue outlook to a decline of 2% to 4%, reflecting the strong broad-based pharmaceutical demand trends we've seen so far, including increased expectations for GLP-1 sales. Our full year COVID-19 vaccine expectations are unchanged. Normalizing for the customer transition, fiscal '25 revenue growth at the midpoint would now be between 18% to 20%. Our expectations for incremental volume from new customers and customer expansions is generally unchanged from what we outlined a quarter ago, over $10 billion of revenue in fiscal '25. For segment profit, following the strength of the first quarter, we are raising our Pharma segment profit guides for the full year to 4% to 6% growth, which I'll note is consistent with our long-term target, despite the contract transition. In terms of Pharma segment profit cadence, given the earlier COVID-19 vaccine season along with the contract expiration, we continue to expect Q2 segment profit to be slightly down year-over-year with growth resuming in our third and fourth quarters. Turning to GMPD. We are updating our GMPD segment revenue outlook to 2% to 4% growth to reflect the recent notification of lost lower margin VA government distribution contracts, which will partially offset some of the new distribution volume we are onboarding in fiscal '25. We do continue to expect 3% to 5% Cardinal Health Brand revenue growth for the year. For segment profit, we are updating our fiscal '25 guidance, primarily to reflect the impact from the health and welfare costs I referenced. We are still in the fight to hit $175 million in segment profit for the year, and the GMPD team is executing on additional initiatives to recover the gap arising from Q1 results. Nevertheless, given the unanticipated health and welfare impacts and other externalities impacting the business, we think it pragmatic in the near term to adjust our GMPD segment profit outlook to a range of $140 million to $175 million. I want to emphasize that while the timing and impact of specific incremental actions identified by the team to support the GMPD strategy and profit growth may be pressed to fully impact our fiscal '25, those efforts continue to support our focus on $300 million as our profit goal for fiscal '26. Regarding GMPD's segment profit quarterly cadence, we continue to expect profit to be back-half weighted with sequential improvements each quarter, driven by the ongoing commercial and operational improvements in the business as well as seasonality. We continue to expect Q2 to be impacted by higher manufacturing costs along with some carryover from the higher health and welfare plan utilization we saw in Q1. In Other, we are reiterating our prior guidance of 10% to 12% revenue growth for the full year and approximately 10% segment profit growth. One note on Other's cadence, we are expecting an industry-wide raw material shortage of Moly-99 to impact the Nuclear business volume and profitability in Q2. As a result, we expect Q2 segment profit growth for Other to moderate to the low- to mid-single digits for the quarter. However, we expect these volumes to generally return in subsequent quarters as delayed procedures are rescheduled. With those details on the table, let's return to the enterprise guidance for a second. On the positive side, we have the combination of a raise to our Pharma full year guidance, which is reflective of our anticipated offset in Q2 from the earlier COVID-19 contribution, and anticipated efficiencies in corporate for the rest of the year. Those positive trends are partially offset by a wider full year profit range we are providing today on GMPD. The combination gets us to our $0.20 raise to guidance at the midpoint following our first quarter. Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on capital deployment. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy continues to be our North Star : invest in the business, protect our investment-grade credit rating, provide baseline return of capital, and assess additional M&A and return of capital opportunities. Of note, even with our announced investment and return of capital plans, we expect to be at the bottom end of our targeted leverage range of 2.5 times by the end of fiscal year '25. As I hope you can tell from our fiscal year '24 and Q1 fiscal '25 announcements, our eyes remain firmly focused on delivering shareholder value creation over the long term. To close, we started fiscal '25 strong. I am especially pleased to see the performance in our Pharma segment, raising segment guidance in our largest and most significant business to our long-term target, while managing through quite a large change is further proof of the strength and resilience of this business. Across all of our businesses, I'm excited for the value-creation opportunities in front of us and look forward to updating you on that in coming months. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason. Jason Hollar : Thanks, Aaron. The strong first quarter results build upon the momentum we've established for the past couple of years by ruthlessly prioritizing simplification and core operational execution to serve our customers and their patients with essential products and industry-leading service. They are also a testament to the actions we've taken to solidify our core foundation and increase our exposure to higher growth and higher margin areas. In Pharma and Specialty Solutions, we've been consistently focused on execution in the core and expanding in Specialty. This quarter, we made further progress on both fronts. We delivered strong operational performance across our distribution network. During the quarter, we achieved multi-year highs in productivity and our service levels reached their highest level in over a year. A key part of our ability to maximize service delivery for customers is our Generics program. Red Oak continues to effectively execute its dual mandate, managing both cost and available supply, which supports the positive volume growth and performance that we've seen and continue to expect. On the business's commercial front, we've seen successful renewals and extensions of key customers in a couple of recent customer onboardings that have gone smoothly due to our team's continual customer focus. In Specialty, we've seen strong continued momentum, both downstream and upstream. We're thrilled to have reached an agreement to acquire Integrated Oncology Networks, as we announced in September. Together, Cardinal Health and ION will continue to push forward in our joint mission to improve cancer care in underserved communities. We will drive innovation through the Navista and Specialty Networks platforms to offer community oncologists, who seek to remain independent, a suite of clinical and economic offerings to improve patient care and enhance practice performance. Integrated Oncology Network adds immediate scale to our offering. Across its 10-state footprint, ION's more than 100 providers deliver broad reaching care in medical and radiation oncology, urology, diagnostic testing and provide other ancillary services. It brings to Navista additional proven in-house MSO solutions, such as revenue cycle management, payer relations and formulary management. When combined with Navista's tech solutions, focused on supporting the clinical and operational needs of independent community oncologists, and Specialty Network's PPS Analytics platform, we can offer a powerful combination for independent physicians to lower costs, improve outcomes, and drive success in value-based care. While we are pleased with the suite of services and capabilities we're building, we will continue to invest organically and actively evaluate additional inorganic opportunities to further accelerate our growth strategies across the specialty therapeutic areas. Upstream with manufacturers, our Biopharma Solutions and Advanced Therapy Solutions businesses continue to develop new offerings. For example, we launched our Advanced Therapy Connect provider ordering solution in the quarter. The streamlined provider portal enables treatment centers to access their contracted cell and gene therapy products in one place to ensure seamless patient care and efficient product availability. Turning to GMPD, where we're continuing to execute our GMPD Improvement Plan Initiatives. Our team is operating with urgency, driving positive operational progress across key priorities, implementing significant distribution wins, taking actions to drive our Cardinal Health Brand pipeline, strengthening our offerings, and mitigating the impact of macro challenges, while enhancing our supply chain resiliency. During the quarter, we secured key distribution renewals and remain on track to implement some notable new distribution wins during the year. Overall utilization trends remain stable and we're seeing consistent growth across our customer base. With Cardinal Health Brand, our leading indicators remain healthy, service levels have continued to trend positively, back orders remain near multi-year lows and we're maintaining industry-leading customer loyalty index scores for US distribution. We're constantly striving to provide our customers and their patients with the right products at the right place and time. On that note, demand for the newest Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding Pump has continued to build in fiscal '25 with onboarding of thousands of patients in the US and Canada in Q1. We look forward to expanding patient access to this pump globally throughout this fiscal year with launches into EMEA and APAC regions. Additionally, we are preparing for the launch of our next-generation Kendall Compression device in the back half of the fiscal year. The next-generation platform is designed for optimal outcomes to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms by enhancing blood circulation. We're also adapting our operations to the macro environment, while leveraging the diversity of our global supply chain. During the quarter, we significantly expanded domestic syringe production at two US-based manufacturing facilities in response to industry-wide disruptions and tariffs. We're managing through external challenges, such as the impacts of the East Coast port strike and Southeastern hurricanes with minimal disruptions to our service. And as we've exited the quarter, we've seen a decline in international freight costs from the recently elevated levels. We're continuing to take an aggressive approach to managing our cost structure and evaluating opportunities to accelerate planned initiatives in support of our goals. In short, with the significant progress we've achieved to date, we remain confident in our turnaround plan and the opportunities for GMPD on the horizon. Turning to our Other businesses. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, the business has continued its double-digit revenue growth with above market growth in the core categories and Theranostics. As Aaron indicated, we are anticipating that an industry-wide shortage will have an adverse impact on second quarter volumes for many of our core low-energy products. We've been working closely with suppliers to maximize available doses to minimize disruptions as much as possible. With PET, we're investing to increase our cyclotron capacity and geographic reach to meet increasing demand for diagnostic imaging agents, such as GE Healthcare's Vizamyl, used for early detection of Alzheimer's and dementia. Outside the core, we've continued to see significant demand for Theranostics products, which again grew revenue over 20% in Q1, most predominantly in the areas of oncology with products such as Telix's Illucix. In at-Home Solutions, we're also continuing to see double-digit revenue growth and deliver a leading customer experience. We've seen strong growth across key categories, such as CGM and urology, which supports our ongoing focus on driving positive operating leverage. The benefits of our investments in additional distribution capacity and increased automation are beginning to take hold. In Q1, our primary operational metrics have achieved the highest levels on record for service, quality and efficiency. We expect to continue investing in the growth and capability of this business. And in OptiFreight Logistics, we're continuing to invest in tech forward platforms, such as our TotalVue Insights and evolve our capabilities to unlock decision driving insights and value for our customers. For example, our recent product launches include enhancements to our limited liability shipment product that provides coverage on critical shipments and makes it easier for customers to view spending trends and tracking on these shipments. We're always working to add incremental value and capabilities to satisfy the needs of our customers. At an enterprise level, the actions we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet over the past several years, along with our team's relentless attention to optimizing our working capital has positioned us with significant financial flexibility. We're continuing to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and prioritize the right strategic choices to accelerate our long-term growth. We are in an active M&A environment and will continue to pursue inorganic activity to those areas that fit with our strategic priorities of investing, primarily in Specialty, as well as the other growth areas of at-Home, Nuclear and OptiFreight. Before I wrap up, I'd like to acknowledge all those affected by the devastating Southeastern hurricanes. Our priority is always the well-being of our employees and our customers. I'm proud, but not surprised at how the Cardinal team has navigated challenges to continue delivering for our customers and their patients. To close, we had a great start to fiscal '25 and are excited to continue building upon our momentum. Thank you to our team for their many tireless efforts, fulfilling our role as healthcare's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Hollar. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question will be coming from Lisa Gill calling from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lisa Gill : Hi. Thanks very much, and good morning. I just really wanted to focus on the drug distribution side of your business, which had really great results. Just a few questions. First, when I think about the vaccine, thank you for calling out the revenue component, Jason or Aaron, can you talk about the margin? Is that materially better? Or is there something else that was driving the margin improvement when we think about the quarter? And then, secondly, when you called out the revenue improvement around Specialty, what we've heard from some of the managed care companies is that changes in IRA is potentially driving incremental volumes, especially around Specialty drugs and those changes will increase as we think about calendar 2025. So, I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about volumes there, margins there? So, just overall my two questions, and a single question would just really be around that segment, first being how to think about the vaccine and contribution to the margin? And then secondly, how do we think about what's happening on the Specialty side? Thanks so much. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Thanks, Lisa. And I'm glad you asked that question first, because that's, I think, very much the highlight of this quarter is what's driving the Pharma segment. We gave a lot of color in the script, but let me go a little bit deeper and just put some additional commentary to -- behind it. It was a strong quarter for the Pharma segment and you referenced a couple of the key components and I'll get into those, but let me just kind of back up and talk about the key drivers overall, because what you're going to hear from me is, there's not any one thing in particular that drove this success this quarter. I'll bucket it into three key buckets. First of all, and I think it's the essence of your question is, we did see very strong and very broad demand utilization across various customers, across various products, classes of trade, really all corners of the Pharma business was strong from utilization perspective. Again, whether we're talking about Brand or in Consumer Health or Generics, you call out Specialty, within Specialty, we saw strength in distribution as well as Biopharma Services -- Solutions. And so, we have, across that spectrum, some really good strength. Specifically with COVID, yes, the volume was stronger this quarter, because the FDA approval, of course, was about a month earlier than last year, so September 11th last year, middle to late August this year. So, we had -- the peak of COVID volumes clearly was in Q1 this year, it was clearly in October and Q2 of last year. So that is a difference. However, I would highlight that the actual contribution to year-over-year earnings for the Pharma segment was a small tailwind, a slight tailwind associated with COVID, so higher and better than what we thought for the first quarter, but not a significant driver of those year-over-year results. It was the other breadth and depth of the strength of the utilization that was a bigger driver. One last comment on the COVID vaccines is, while we see the timing difference for Q1 and Q2, for the full year, we're still anticipating -- anticipate being the same, a modest headwind year-over-year, but that will be -- all that headwind will be in the second quarter. So that's the first point, the primary point, strong volume across the board. Second point is the volume that we did see, we did see some favorable mix. So, the types of customers' class of trade was more favorable. But I would highlight that that's really on the back of that broad strength and underlying utilization. And then, the final leg of the stool is the fact that, with that volume we had fantastic service levels, multi-year productivity enhancements. In a quarter in which we had a lot of change, a lot of transition of customers, we performed incredibly well, meaning that that volume that we did have, we were able to deliver it efficiently and, to some degree, we were actually even deliberate, right, having good service levels, improved service levels in this quarter, strong levels that allowed us to actually execute upon that. So, those are the drivers. It's more than just vaccines, it's more than just Specialty. Within your question around IRA, and perhaps there may be some dynamics there, we did see Specialty growth faster than the overall when you look at our overall enterprise growth, our Pharma growth, ex the large customer transition, that was 16%. When you look at Specialty in the same way, it was a little bit higher than that. So, we did see some strength there, but I wouldn't say that this was driven by that. It was a component of that underlying growth. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Michael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll try a similar approach to Lisa. One question with a couple of pieces tied into it. I just want to bridge the gap on the 300-basis-point uptick in Pharma guidance for the year. Is there any way -- I mean, Jason, I heard you talk a lot about utilization improvements, but any way you can give us a sense of what were the biggest drivers that led to the full year improvement? And specifically within there, you mentioned the COVID headwind being modest year-over-year. I just want to make sure it's the same level modest? And then, anything you can say on GLP-1 economics, whether that played any role in the guidance uptick or not? Thank you. Aaron Alt : Great. Good morning. Happy to talk and provide some perspective on the updates to guidance for Pharma. And of course, starting where Jason left off, we are really pleased with the Q1 performance, leading to the raised for a guide to actually to our long-term target of 4% to 6% in profit growth for the year. It's really driven by the strength and the resiliency of the business in Q1 that we see continuing as we carry forward. Now part of this is just execution. You heard Jason referenced the strong broad-based demand, right? That certainly assists in the raise to our guidance. It's also the case that, as we walked into Q1, we were very focused on how are we going to execute as part of the customer transition. And the good news is that we managed -- the team managed that very well, both from an income statement perspective and from a working capital perspective. The impact that we were anticipating in Q1 was offset by significant simplification. We got more done there than we had anticipated, especially networks contributed, the new customers, you heard me say we've started to onboard those as well. And so, the pieces are really coming together, helping to give us more confidence then as we carry forward through the year as well how the offset of that business will continue. Now, our guidance assumes consistent market dynamics in our Generics portfolio. We saw strength in Q1 in Generics and we anticipate those consistent market dynamics are continuing. Our guidance also continues to see increased contributions from Brand and Specialty Products. I won't repeat what Jason just had to say about that category. COVID-19, we did guide at the start of the year, and indeed, our guidance continues that it will be a modest headwind for us through the year, notwithstanding that it was a modest tailwind for us during Q1. On the revenue side of the house, right, of course, we did call up our overall guide there, and that's driven in part by strength from the existing customers and strength from the new customers and GLP-1s are continuing to contribute and grow more so than we had originally expected, and that's about 4 percentage points of the revenue increase. Now from a cadence perspective on the guide, anticipating perhaps your next question, Q2 we are guiding to be slightly down due to the headwind from COVID-19. The second half, we are expecting to be consistent with the guide of 4% to 6% that we have for the long term. And as I frequently say, Q3 will be the highest dollar profit quarter just given that's when we see the impact of Brand inflation over the over the course as well. One final note on the guide. Our guide does not include the impact of ION, of the Integrated Oncology Network acquisition. We will provide that update to our guidance when we close, although I am pleased to report that the HSR waiting period on that transaction has now expired and subject to the completion of some other customary closing conditions, we are anticipating that we're going to close that deal by the end of the calendar year. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Yes, Pharma was strong, but I do want to ask on medical here. So, how do we think about the quarterly progression in medical at this point for the balance of the year? And then, how are you thinking about kind of just underlying demand trends, excluding some of those dynamics that you were talking about in your prepared remarks, but just underlying utilization across that medical segment? Thank you. Aaron Alt : Appreciate the question. Let me offer some perspective on both the quarter and the year as we carry forward. I want to start with the headline that we are still in the fight to hit the $175 million. That was our original guide for the year. And it is absolutely the case that we continue to make progress against the GMPD Improvement Plan and our fiscal '26 target of $300 million, which is unchanged notwithstanding the results in Q1. We did update our guide for the year to be $140 million to $175 million, primarily reflecting some unanticipated health and wellness costs. And just a little bit more context on that, at the enterprise level, that was around $45 million. I think I called out about half of the $91 million increase in overall SG&A. About a-third of that was an error by our actuaries tied to in prior years. The rest was tied to a notable increase in the number of claims as well as a notable increase in the cost per claim at an unusual level for us. That's really what was driving the Q1 performance. We were otherwise quite pleased with the GMPD progress against the plan, the tenacity they showed, and continued to find additional opportunities to help drive the plan. Now, the health and wellness challenges, we aren't anticipating they'll be at the same level in Q1, certainly given the breakdown I just gave you. They will modestly carry into Q2, but the team continues to accelerate as we knew they would, as we planned they would, against the execution of the GMPD Improvement Plan for fiscal '25. And we are seeing increased contributions from the plan initiatives. The mitigation of the supply chain cost inflation is well within progress, right? Significant year-over-year growth from the fiscal '24 inflation mitigation that we've already experienced. We are anticipating the Cardinal Health Brand revenue growth will continue following the 3% fiscal '24 revenue growth there. And the team has proven very tenacious in finding additional ways to simplify and cost optimize their business as we carry forward. From a cadence perspective, the cadence for our guide remains unchanged from our prior guidance. We have always said the plan -- the GMPD Improvement Plan will be back-half weighted, and indeed that continues. There's no change to the overall seasonality of the business from what we've described previously, but we are expecting sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter as we push ahead. Jason Hollar : The only thing I would add is, there's an element of utilization, I think, in your question, Erin. You certainly didn't see the same level of strength on the medical side that we have seen on Pharma products. But with that said, it's fairly consistent utilization than what we've seen more recently, historically in the last year or two. So, we're not seeing big changes there, which to me is partly positive just given you think about all the macro factors and the hurricanes and, of course, the disruptions with saline, that we're not seeing big changes. Some smaller health systems we do see there being some deferral or cancellation of some procedures, but overall we've not seen wide aspects throughout the industry on that. So, cautiously optimistic that we as well as our customers are doing a fantastic job of managing through some disruptions that at this point we don't see materially impacting underlying utilization. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. The next question will be coming from Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Percher : Thank you. A question on Pharma. We heard some commentary from manufacturers of GLP-1s on inventory fluctuation and I'd expect that the DSA agreements do not allow you to build inventory and Pharma has pretty good visibility. So, can we check that assumption? And then, relative to GL1 -- GLP-1 inventory, have you been able to optimize as growth stabilizes and was that at all a factor in improving cash flow? Jason Hollar : Yeah. So, I'm aware of some comments on GLP-1 inventory. Obviously, can't speak for the broader industry. For us, specifically, we manage this very closely. You can imagine that there's a lot of volatility in terms of strong demand, supply that does not meet that demand. So, we're managing it at a very detailed manual level. And we have seen very static levels of inventory, relatively low levels of inventory that have not fluctuated much at all over the last several quarters, relatively low levels of inventory, certainly. But it is our practice, our priority to get this product in the hands of our customers, and ultimately to patients as quickly as possible. So no, we have not been changing our levels of inventory in any meaningful way whatsoever. And as it relates to our -- the impact on our underlying financials, it is 5% of that 16% Q1 revenue growth. So, it was certainly meaningful to our top-line. And still that implies strong growth ex that GLP-1 impact. But as we've always said, it is not a meaningful driver of our earnings and that continues to be the case and is not a significant driver of the financial results other than revenue for this particular quarter. And given the inventory is now fluctuating, is also not a significant driver of our cash flow. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : The next question will be coming from Allen Lutz of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Allen Lutz : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. One for Aaron. The gross margin, really nice improvement year-over-year. Obviously, you're getting some type of benefit there from losing a low-margin customer, but is there any way to frame the puts and takes on the gross margin line excluding that contract change? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Actually, I'm going to take that one first. I know you give it to Aaron. I'll let him talk after me, but I'm the one that made a lot of statements on this before Aaron arrived and after he arrived. So, I did not -- when gross margin rates were lower year-over-year, I always highlighted that's not how we manage our business. We manage our business on gross margin dollars. And so, I'm not going to take credit for gross margin rate improvements when we lose a low-margin large customer. So, I appreciate the fact that we like the direction of those metrics and, all things being equal, I would love to have higher margin rates, especially if revenues are growing higher, but in a business like this that has negative working capital, very slim overall margins. What's important is how we manage the balance between our SG&A and our gross margin. And that's -- this is another great example of at this point quarter that regardless of the gross margin rate, we managed gross margin dollars higher than our SG&A increase and that's what keeps this model working the way it is and that's what we're going to continue to be focused on. We'll celebrate the margin rate increases, which are largely driven by the cost reductions and the mix benefits and having more higher-margin customers, fewer lower-margin customers, but it's not a model change, and that's the key thing I want to get across. And I just realized I probably took all your talking points, Aaron. Anything to add? Aaron Alt : I thought that was incredibly well said, Jason. Jason Hollar : Okay. Thank you. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : We will now move to Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Caliendo : Thanks. I appreciate you taking my question or questions. So, I just want to make sure there's been no necessarily any change in GLP-1 economics going forward at all. That's not driving in any way the change in guidance for the full year. And two, sort of secondarily, one of the infusion companies who reported this week suggested that STELARA pricing, brand pricing was going to get cut come 1/1/25 when biosimilars came. And I'm just wondering, I know part of that's infusion, part of that is subcu, but I'm wondering if a brand company lowers price to sort of a lower level, how does that impact you? Does this potentially impact you in any way? Can you just talk through the economics of how that would work and potentially impact you, if at all? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Sure. Yeah. No, the GLP-1 economics, I think I basically answered that one before, so I don't think there's much else to add there. It's not a key part of the change. Again, I highlighted that broad strength and I didn't even mention GLP specifically when I was talking about the key drivers there. Again, we love innovation. We think that's great for the industry. It's great for us, it benefits -- we like the volume, it helps allow us to be even more efficient and things of that nature. But it's not something that specifically drove the underlying strength that we saw in all those other areas that I highlighted. So, it's a component, but it's definitely not the driver. In terms of the STELARA comment, this is not new when it comes to price changes that we see in our industry, the model continues to work in the way that makes sense for us. We basically operate on a fixed fee basis for our service. And that concept was recently tested yet again with insulin and those dramatic price reductions that we saw at that point. And not only us, but our peers, you didn't hear us talking a lot about that type of flow through. So, we continue to believe that we are by far the best alternative to delivering these products safely, securely and efficiently in the marketplace. And when the price levels change, the dollar fee we get for those prices from -- to stock and support on the manufacturer side is unchanged. We provide the exact same service and expect to get the exact same financial compensation for that. So, we continue to expect that model to continue to evolve. And whether you're talking about, again, insulin or STELARA, you also have all the IRA products that will happen in phases over, well, the future. And each of those cases, we would expect that model to continue to hold given how we have structured that today and how we'll continue to evolve with it. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will be coming from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead. Eric Coldwell : Thanks very much. Good morning, and congrats on the good performance here. I had a couple, just quick ones on GMPD. I just want to confirm that profit in the segment would have more than doubled, it looks like, if not for the unexpected increase in health and wellness costs. And just so I guess a confirmation on that. And then, is it possible to size the incremental manufacturing costs as you build out the syringe capacity in the US? And also talk about what you're seeing with international costs across other products? We're hearing some suppliers might be raising their costs as we're seeing some of these China tariff knock-ons and then some of the other limitations to China product coming into the US market for other reasons. So, I guess, a multi-fold question around GMPD, but anything you could help us size what -- if there is such a thing as underlying profit growth, ex health and wellness and ex the increase in manufacturing cost would be helpful. Thanks. Aaron Alt : I appreciate the questions. A couple of quick responses. First, your math is, no doubt, correct. Where if you add the $17 million headwind from health and wellness to the $8 million delivery, that would put you at mid-$20-million-s profit delivery on an operating basis for the business, ex that one adjustment. And then broadly the quantification or the estimation, if you will, of the manufacturing costs, it was a similar dollar impact to the health and wellness impact in Q1. Jason Hollar : Yeah. And on your last part of your question related to costs, you're referencing products coming out of China, you're really getting at the tariffs that are going to go into place here beginning in January and then rolling out later. So we -- let me make a broad statement about it that I think is consistent with how to think about it in the short term. We have a very diversified supply base, but it's -- given it's diversified, it's not entirely in the US. We've highlighted about half of our Cardinal Health Brand products come from North America, which does include a decent amount coming out of Mexico as well. But we use some degree out of China, less than 10% sourced out of China. We don't manufacture anything in China, but we use Southeast Asia. We use Latin America quite a bit as well. And like I mentioned, US and Mexico. So we have a very diverse supply base that has served us fairly well. We had challenges, of course, during COVID when perhaps too much was in Asia and we continue to migrate that. But when you add tariffs on top of it, that is something that will raise costs, there's no doubt about that. It will mean that we will take it from the economically optimal location to one that's less optimal and that will raise costs not only for us but throughout the industry. And you know our margins, you know the margins in this space that -- if there's a 10% across the board type of tariff that will have to flow through in some way. We will do everything we can to keep that from flowing through entirely to our customers, but there will be some impacts that will have to be absorbed. So, your commentary around some data points that we're already seeing it for these very short lists of products, namely syringes and PPE that's occurring here in the near term, I think is representative of that. Those are products that are largely sourced out of Southeast Asia and especially into China. And you are seeing some pricing changes that are coming through the marketplace anecdotally. And we think that makes sense, because the low-cost alternative is being impacted with a higher cost and that will have to flow through the supply base. Of course, we're working on solutions to minimize that impact, but I think it's something that should be expected that there will be price increases. Matt Sims : Next question. Operator : We'll now go to George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and I hope you'll forgive the joke, which is I have just one question but in 27 parts. But actually a lot of the questions that I'm getting this morning from investors focus on the Pharma OP outperformance in the quarter. And Aaron or Jason, I was wondering if you guys would either just maybe attribute kind of vaccine versus it sounds like GLP-1s weren't much versus generics and other. And you guys called out the Generics program, where we've seen kind of an increase in some generic drug prices and we've seen an increase in generic drug shortages, which we both tend to think of as being able to contribute to Pharma margins. So, again just like outperformance kind of vaccines versus other, and would just kind of love your -- hear your commentary on what's happening in the generic drug market as it relates to pricing and shortages. Jason Hollar : Yeah. I can kind of force rank. I mean, what we put into our comments and what's in the presentation, you can see that our Brand and Specialty Products together are the greatest drivers. Within that, both Brand and Specialty were good drivers. Again, I'll say it again, the vaccines were a slight year-over-year increase. I think we quantified before last year that it was about $25 million of profit in the quarter. It was a little bit higher than that, but it's not the driver of it. Generics was notable. It's not as large as Brand and Specialty, but it was also a driver of it. And that's why I answered the question the way I did is that, we're seeing strength in utilization across the board and we had strong operational and cost performance as well. That was a nice tailwind, more simple operating environment, of course, this particular quarter. Even though we had a lot of change, we managed to do that very well. But that's the best I can do, given -- and again you can do the math with the revenue growth highlights. It was pretty good revenue as well with 16% ex the customer transition, 5 percentage points of that being GLP-1. So, still quite strong kind of core revenue growth, which translates into all those categories I referenced. Aaron Alt : So, one thing I would add is, we did -- as we usually do, we called out the fact that Generics program had consistent market dynamics, which you should really take as the sign that we saw good volumes there, because there's nothing extraordinary happening on the buyer. So, we managed these two sides together. Jason Hollar : Exactly. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Next question will be coming from Stephanie Davis calling from Barclays. Please go ahead. Stephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. I've got one that kind of dovetails what Eric asked. I was hoping to hear how you're thinking about the puts and takes of the potential election outcome, since you could have some easing M&A risk for Pharma, there's potential tariff risk in GMPD, just kind of your broader thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Sure. Well, I think the first thing I would think about is, the good news is, I think most people in DC believe that affordable access to healthcare is really important. And when you've heard me talk about any of these topics, I talk about we love affordability, we love transparency, we love access, because ultimately that drives the utilization for the right products to solve those patients' needs, which just helps us be an even better provider to those that ultimately provide those services to the patients. So, I don't see that at the highest level. There is a difference in wanting what's best for the patient. Of course, there's different ways to get there. You've heard my commentary already today about tariffs being something that could impact how prices flow through to the industry. And we see that our customers are already under a lot of reimbursement pressure and that's something that's certainly top of mind for us. But at the end of the day, there's a lot more not known about how that would flow through and how medical and pharma products would be included. That creates just some level of uncertainty with that. But ultimately in doing what's best for the patient is something that I think will always be the North Star. And we feel that we're very well positioned to work with either party, whether we're talking about the President or either of the other elements of Congress. So, we're in a good spot and we have a lot of momentum going into that and we don't foresee that changing in the near, medium or long term. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : We'll now go to Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, ma'am. Elizabeth Anderson : Hey, guys, thanks so much for the question. Can you talk about the -- some of the simplification efforts? I think, I mean, obviously this has been a longer term trend for you guys. Where are we in that? How much of it was obviously driven by the contract change this quarter? But do we think about sort of the rest of the year and beyond to help us maybe think through that a little bit more? And then just one follow up on the Nuclear supply shortage timeline. Like, how do you see that evolving across the rest of the year in terms of like the potential timeline for that? If any kind of parameters you could help put on that would be helpful. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Thanks. As it relates to simplification, it's not any one particular business. This is very much a core part of our broader strategy. It has absolutely served us well and it's a bit cliched, but it is absolutely a journey and not a destination. So, I think that there's probably more opportunity relative to the size of the business for GMPD than there is for Pharma. But even within Pharma, this quarter I think highlighted that we can do some things I'm not sure we fully understood. So, there's going to be an ongoing journey here to continue to challenge ourselves and continue to find additional ways to be even more efficient. Throughout our whole enterprise, we don't use a ton of automation in all aspects of our business. We are absolutely testing and learning in different parts of the company that as we learn from that we introduced in other parts. So, I think, there's a lot of opportunity there within GMPD, whether we're talking about our distribution network or manufacturing. Manufacturing especially is always an area that's always going to have opportunity through automation, through new and improved processes. One little anecdote with this, it shows up in the financial numbers, all the efficiencies. We have had this last quarter fantastic safety metrics, something we don't often talk about, because it's not directly related to financials, but it's really important to our team and it just shows that our underlying processes are working incredibly well, much, much better than we have historically, which is driving improvements throughout the process. We've talked quite a bit about the investments we're making in at-Home. I referenced in some of my comments that we have best on record metrics this quarter, all the way from quality to service to efficiency to safety, was also an all-time high on record for that business as well, highlighting that the right investments, where we're making more automation investments there than we are in other businesses as a percentage of the size of the business. And we're going to continue to learn from that and roll that out more broadly. So, we have received a lot of value from it. I think there's still more to come, but I would also say that's part of that continued ongoing expectation for those long-term targets that we have. We have these types of cost reductions baked into that. And of course, our customers are always wanting to share in that. And so, we'll continue to find ways to be competitive, but also try to put some of that to the bottom-line as well. On Nuclear, so this is a bit of unfortunate timing with three of the six reactors that typically we derive our product from out of Europe for Moly-99 being down simultaneously, some planned, some unplanned type of downtime. The good news is, we do have a pretty good line of sight as to those reactors coming back up in the next week or two. So, this seems to be about a one month type of impact for us. Pretty significant for this month of October, starting to come up over the course of the next couple of weeks, and we have a pretty good line of sight to indicate that it will be resolved within this quarter. Then, the volumes will take a couple of more quarters. We believe most of that will come back, because of course, at the end of this process is a patient that needs these types of scans. This is a low energy product that's usually more for cardiac type of scanning procedures. So these are patients that we expect to reschedule this in the next couple of quarters, but I doubt it will go beyond the fiscal year, but it's still a bit early to understand the full implications of that. Aaron Alt : Just to put a pin in that, we have not changed our guidance for the full year for the other segments as a result of it. This was a timing or a cadence observation only. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question is from Daniel Grosslight calling from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Grosslight : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Just a question on GMPD, and really you mentioned the loss of a couple regions in the VA program. I was curious if, more broadly speaking, you're seeing an increase in the competitive intensity within this segment, specifically as one of your competitors is rumored to be going public soon? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yeah. My comments here will be the same as they've been in the past. It's a competitive, it's stable environment. That VA business you're talking about was relatively low margin, quite low Cardinal Brand products attached to it. So, it's something that we would have liked to have kept it, but at the same time there's not as much value associated with that as with other customers. So, I don't see that that's anything different than what we see within this space, just normal type of customer rotation. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Yes, sir. The next question will be from Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Please go ahead, sir. Charles Rhyee : Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just maybe a couple of quick clarifications. Jason, you kind of made a comment, I think maybe it's related to hurricanes about some deferrals and cancellations of procedures. Are you saying just those are just hurricane related and has distribution kind of -- everything kind of picked back up since? And then, also related to the healthcare high utilization costs, is that -- what are your assumptions for the level of utilization going forward? And is that already embedded into the guide? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yeah. So, to be clear, when I was talking about the hurricanes that was -- it was GMPD, and what I indicated was we're not seeing anything meaningful at all for that, that both us and our customers are managing it quite well. Utilization is -- what I was highlighting is that utilization is not as strong as on the Pharma side, but I wouldn't say that's because GMPD is weak. I would just say that because Pharma has been stronger. Which I think leads into the second part of your question, which is that we're guiding for a normal utilization type of environment. So, it would be more consistent with, as you heard from Aaron, our long-term guidance. That's basically effectively what -- when you normalize for the COVID timing and things of that nature, what we're guiding for in Qs two to four is much more normalized type of earnings growth, which would be consistent with a normalized level of utilization. Matt Sims : Next question, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our last question today will be coming from Stephen Baxter calling from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. Just one last kind of cleanup one on the Pharma guidance. So, appreciate all the comments that the strength is broad based and there's some differences in cadence to keep in here. I guess when we think about the $16 million raise on the EBIT line, you're very clear that it's not driven by COVID. Do we think about this as largely just being the Q1 underlying favorability in the business, or should we think about this as the annualization of the favorability that you saw in the first quarter, assuming that strength is largely going to continue into the balance of the year? Thanks. Jason Hollar : Yeah. And so, it depends on which pieces we're talking about. For the three elements that I talked about in terms of what's driving the growth of the business, the first element I highlighted was the underlying broad volume growth. And I highlighted that would be -- for our Qs two to four would be more normalized levels of growth. I also highlighted part of this quarter's favorability was favorable mix that some quarters as positive, some as negative, some as neutral. This particular quarter was more favorable. So that's the type of thing that normally does not continue one direction or the other. And then, of course, our ongoing cost reductions is the smaller of the pieces, but still relevant in all this. So, it's the combination of all that. But again, our guidance here anticipates a more normalized level. Except for that COVID piece will, certainly with pretty high confidence, we've seen COVID vaccines peak and come down now. We track this very, very tightly. It will be quite a modest impact headwind in the second quarter that's baked into this. But ex that, we expect more normalized levels of performance. Matt Sims : Great. Operator : Thank you very much. As we have no further questions, Mr. Hollar, I'd like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you. Jason Hollar : Yeah. Just thanks again for joining us this morning. Again, an excellent start to the year, showing our broad strength, resiliency, and momentum of our broad business, especially our largest, most significant Pharma business. We're pleased to be in a position to raise our guidance after only the first quarter and looking forward to continuing to give you more updates throughout the year. With that, thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your attendance. We wish you a very good day. Have a good day, and goodbye.",
