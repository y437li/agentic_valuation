Gary: Yes, thank you Harry. Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains -- oops I\u2019ve got your part, Harry. I\u2019m pleased to note that unlike our last call, Harry and I are both in the same room today. As you may recall on our year-end visit in late January, we were each at our respective homes due to the snowstorm that caught Atlanta off guard. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all happy that spring has come following two consecutive years of bitter winter from much of North America. Incidentally, this past March was the coldest it has been for over a decade, 12 years. A number of people in other areas have weighed in recently on this winter weather and its impact on business, even our new Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen, commented on the issue and said that the harsh winter weather may have had an impact on recent economic data. Despite what some referred to as the new normal weather pattern, we are pleased to have overcome this negative impact on our business. And we\u2019re proud to report another quarter of both improved revenue and profit. I think the key to our strategy has been to have enough business improvement initiatives in the works, so we\u2019re not devastated by abnormal weather. We can do something about developing and implementing those programs, but nothing about the latter. Revenue for the quarter grew 4.6% which was somewhat disappointing to $313.4 million, compared to $299.7 million in the first quarter of last year.  Net income increased 11.2% to $25.8 million with EPS of $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $23.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. We\u2019re definitely pleased with our conversion of profit improvement from our revenue increase. Our business historically has been built on increasing our recurring revenue. Almost 80% of the revenue we recognize each month is for scheduled services that are on the books as of the first of the month. I\u2019d like to think of this as the gift that keeps on giving. In a sense, we\u2019re much like the phone company or cable TV business. We worked hard last year to continue building our commercial revenue business and we saw the strength this quarter. Of this improvement, with the 6.6% growth, as Harry will explain shortly once you factor out the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, the commercial percent revenue improvement was almost unchanged from last quarter. Our commercial customers be it large national company or a local-owned restaurant can afford to defer retaining their pest control services regardless of whether it\u2019s a mild or severe winter. Residential sequential growth slowed similar to what we saw last year. We don\u2019t have a lot of new customers coming into the sales funnel in the first quarter, especially with the weather we had, but still residential pest control grew a respectable 3.9%. The snow and cold weather doesn\u2019t kill the termites but it does drive them deeper in the ground until the temperature warms. As a result, termite revenue was almost a breakeven, up 0.1%.  On a positive note, it was obvious that bed bugs don\u2019t care about the outside temperature because it\u2019s always warm where they live. Our bed bug business continues to grow and was up 15% for the quarter. As noted in the past our strong customer retention provides us with excellent recurring revenue and profits. These two factors coupled with our growing brand recognition, have enabled us to expand our business and allowed us to meet our financial objectives from year-to-year. In fact, this quarter represents our 32nd quarter of improved revenue and profitability, 8 years. We also believe that we have several competitive advantages. By virtue of our size we are able to reach out to existing and potential customers, nationally, locally, and internationally through traditional and social media and Internet marketing. Most of our competitors don\u2019t benefit in this regard. Our public relations team is a major contributor to our communications effort and focus on building our brands. Last year, this team\u2019s outreach generated approximately 264 million local and national media impressions, while positioning our company as the pest expert. These means however is just one piece of our ongoing programs to connect with the customer. Providing education to the consumer has always been at the forefront of what we do.  From the 1950s, we have been routinely providing science education by sharing our perspective on insects with young students throughout North America. Recently we created our new school pest control presentation website, which makes it easier for teachers to schedule and track the status of their presentation request. We also continue to partner with the National Science Teachers Organization, NSTA, to promote our Orkin Man school presentation program which has been highly popular and successful. Last summer we again teamed up with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and produced a pest control and prevention tips for mosquitoes and ticks. The sound bites from this effort generated more than 5.3 million media impressions. We are partnered with the CDC since 2004 and look forward to working with them again this year on important projects. To better build stronger relationships with our customers we are generating a quarterly e-news letter, which inform recipients about Orkin, pest-related illnesses, year-around pest control and other pertinent subjects. In 2013 more than 400,000 newsletters were distributed. We\u2019re continuing this program again this year. We believe another competitive advantage that sets our company apart is our Atlanta learning center and Tempo, our internal training and education website. The ever revolving pest related training that we provide or employees resulted on us being recognized again by Training Magazine for the 12th consecutive year is one of the top training companies in America. This year we\u2019ve ranked 55 among the group of 125 companies, joining a very select few companies that they can say that they\u2019ve been so recognized with this award for more than a decade. This training publication indicates that their ranking was determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, including financial investment and employee development, the scope of the development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to business goals and objectives. We remain committed to continuous improvement within all of those training metrics. And each year we\u2019re challenged to take our training up another notch. In the first quarter, usage of the Rollins management system consisted of over 42,000 log-ins and over 100,000 core selections. Our employees are benefiting professionally and most often financially from this commitment to training. I should also add that Texas A&M University announced during the quarter that Rollins employees passed the milestone of participation by completing over 10,000 online courses on termite biology and control. Texas A&M has created the industry\u2019s best online termite control training courses. Another area we take very seriously is risk management and specifically, the safety of our employees. Recently, we have been made aware of the dangers of talking or texting while driving. Some states have a ban on handheld talking or texting, and the list is growing. On most days of the year we have over 8,000 company vehicles on the road servicing our customers around the country. Most of the drivers of these vehicles have a company cell phone and many also have a personal cell phone. We believe that there\u2019s nothing so important that it can\u2019t wait for one to pull over and stop to make a returning call. Rollins has therefore adopted this year a total ban on texting or talking on a cell phone while driving a company car, our personal car, while on company business. Statistics indicated distracting driving accidents have increased 100% over the last five years. And with cell phone, work-related vehicle deaths up over 35,000 individuals in the U.S. annually. We felt that this was an issue that needed to be addressed to ensure the safety of our employees and the public. As you can imagine it was not necessarily a popular decision initially, but much like enforcing seatbelt use, it\u2019s the right thing to do. This year we have created the Rollins marketplace or what we refer to internally as our procure-to-pay initiative. The objective is to have all of our operations and brands ordering supplies online, exclusively through our marketplace. We\u2019re already benefiting from improved efficiency and it's helping us to obtain better national contracts and improved pricing, ultimately reducing our cost. We\u2019re continuing to advance our goal of establishing international footprint via franchises and select acquisitions. We were pleased to announce last week an agreement in principal to acquire Statewide Pest Management headquartered in Shepparton, Australia, our second acquisition in that country. This company was established in 1997 and provides services to both commercial and residential accounts in the State of Victoria, which includes metropolitan Melbourne, and reaches up into the New South Wales area. Statewide would do approximately $5 million in annual revenue. And we\u2019re expecting to close at the end of this month and are excited to have Statewide join our company. We also established two new global franchises during the quarter, adding to our growing roster of international franchises, our first in Uruguay and our third in China. We remain committed to adding to both our international and domestic franchises. This is an exciting time for Rollins. And we\u2019re expecting to have a good 2014. We have many opportunities to expand and improve our company. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you each quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Harry. Harry? Rollins: Yes, thank you Harry. Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains -- oops I\u2019ve got your part, Harry. I\u2019m pleased to note that unlike our last call, Harry and I are both in the same room today.

We have many opportunities to expand and improve our company. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you each quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Harry. Harry? Harry: Thank you, Gary. What is it lately with drama in our conference calls? Last quarter snow kept us out of the office for the call. This time, my daughter was wheeled into the delivery room about 10 minutes ago. I\u2019m expecting the arrival of a granddaughter any minute. I may need to talk fast. Looking at the numbers, the company reported first quarter revenues of 313.4 million, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter revenue of 299.7 million. We experienced that growth across all of our family of brands but one, not surprisingly one based in the northeast. Overall net income increased 11.2% to 25.8 million compared to 23.2 million with EPS up 12.5% to $0.18 versus $0.16 per diluted share last year in the first quarter. A good start to New Year in less than ideal conditions. As Gary has already stressed, it is especially important for us to add recurring revenue customers to our base. I don\u2019t want to get into any debate on global warming. However, we did see it in the first quarter again this year. With spring appearing to come later, our anticipated lead did occur as planned with slow demand. Fortunately, improved closure per set and higher average price enabled us to overcome the decreases in pest control lead, allowing us to achieve a modest growth in sales. Our termite sales team gave us a good old college try, achieved higher closure and higher average price but could not quite overcome the double digit decrease in termite lead. Overall we continue to see improved customer satisfaction and retention, key indicators over the long-term health of our service. Strategically, Rollins decided to focus on our commercial pest control business back in the 90s after selling off all of our non-pest control businesses, home security, maid service, lawn care. Today, we have become the largest commercial pest control provider in North America, representing nearly 43% of our business. In total, commercial pest control grew 6.6% in the first quarter, 7.3% excluding fumigation. Fumigation was up 8.4% in the quarter. That was mostly due to the large grain operators who typically schedule their fumigations over long weekend. Easter this year falls in April versus March last year. We closed the Australian Allpest acquisition in late February, which contributed some revenue to the quarter. However, it was offset by a significant weaker Canadian dollar this year. Our residential pest control business, having long been the cornerstone of our company and represents almost 39% of our business, had nearly 4,000 less calls in the first quarter this year. But thanks to the recurring revenue base built over the last year, still grew 3.9%. The sequential decrease in growth from the fourth quarter was a drop of 1.9% versus 2.5% last year. The residential business is the most pest-problem-dependent as a potential customer usually waits till they have a sighting, picks up the phone or goes to the computer and contacts us.  Fortunately, not all of our brands are as dependent on leads. Much of HomeTeam\u2019s new business is driven by new home construction. Though the new home housing start slowdown has been widely reported, we are fortunate that we are located in stronger housing markets. It\u2019s hard to think a 7.7% growth in installs start was a slow quarter, but it was far better than the industry at large. We were pleased with our almost 19,000 new installs this quarter. HomeTeam was able to overcome the smaller incremental installs and had some nice margin improvement. Let\u2019s not forget termite, which is the most seasonal of our service lines and represents less than 17% of our business. While 50% of the revenue from the service offering is recurring, i.e. the annual renewal payments, the other 50% is not, and whether in the termite reproduction cycle has a definite impact on the annual swarm season. I\u2019m not an entomologist, but I do know that termites like warm weather to get amorous, grow wings and reproduce. This quarter, we saw a large double digit decrease in leads. But fortunately, our termite sales force has some ancillary services, installation, dry zone, et cetera, to sell. Termite revenues were up one-tenth of 1% aided by Australia. Without the first time revenues of termite from Australia, our termite revenues actually fell domestically 1.1%. You have to go back to the first quarter of 2008 to see a more disappointing quarter for termites. For those interested in our bed bug business, it was up 15% to $11.6 million. 35% of that business today is residential, 65% commercial. Bed bugs do tend to be more active as the year goes, so be on the lookout and remember, they have no preference on spread count. Gross margin for the quarter improved to 48.5% for the first quarter versus 48.1% in the prior year. The quarter benefited from lower fleet costs due to gains and disposal of vehicles and good cost control spread across most expense line. This more than offsets from productivity losses, as we geared up our termite technicians for a spring that was delayed. Frankly, you can wait and see what happens in the first quarter before staffing and training. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased slightly, 320,000 totaling 10.2 million. Depreciation was 3.3 million and amortization of intangible was 6.9 million. For the full year amortization of intangibles typically from the value assigned to acquire customer contract will represent a significant after tax non-cash charge of $0.12 this year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased 1.5 million or 1.5% to 32.1% of revenues decreasing from 33.1% from last year. The decrease in cost as a percent of sales is due to reductions made in administrative salaries reflecting realignment of some of our operations and cost containment programs initiated at the corporate offices late last year. Income before income taxes was up 17.7% in the quarter, but unfortunately the tax rate for the quarter climbed over last year coming in at 37.7% for the quarter, where I expect it to remain for the time being. As a result, our net income was up only 11.2%. Our balance sheet remains strong. Despite our best efforts to reinvest more heavily in our business, spending 53.6 million on acquisition of companies in the quarter, we still ended the quarter with 83 million in cash and no debt. We\u2019re confident that there are other great pest control companies to pursue. The deal pipeline is the strongest we have seen in some time. Another interesting facet of this business was working capital, which remain negative despite our strong cash position. We continue to have more customers prepay us for services, $98.5 million in current unearned revenue than those who owe us for current services 72.7 million in trade receivable. What a great business. On another note, we were pleased to have been advised last week that Rollins has once again been selected to the Barron\u2019s 400 Index. This marks the seventh time we have been chosen to the index since its conception in 1997. According to Barron, only about 6% of all North American publicly listed companies are selected to the Barron\u2019s 400 on the basis of their fundamental standing. This underscores the overall strength of our company\u2019s financial result and its great prospect. Before I turn the call back to Gary, let me express our appreciation and thank you to all our associates and others whose hard work and dedication contributed to a challenging quarter and are committed to producing another record year. We also thank our customers, suppliers and shareholders for their continued support. Global warming or not, spring has arrived, the phones are ringing, and we\u2019re very excited about our prospects for the balance of 2014. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Gary. Cynkus: Thank you, Gary. What is it lately with drama in our conference calls? Last quarter snow kept us out of the office for the call.

But fortunately, our termite sales force has some ancillary services, installation, dry zone, et cetera, to sell. Termite revenues were up one-tenth of 1% aided by Australia. Without the first time revenues of termite from Australia, our termite revenues actually fell domestically 1.1%. You have to go back to the first quarter of 2008 to see a more disappointing quarter for termites. For those interested in our bed bug business, it was up 15% to $11.6 million. 35% of that business today is residential, 65% commercial. Bed bugs do tend to be more active as the year goes, so be on the lookout and remember, they have no preference on spread count. Gross margin for the quarter improved to 48.5% for the first quarter versus 48.1% in the prior year. The quarter benefited from lower fleet costs due to gains and disposal of vehicles and good cost control spread across most expense line. This more than offsets from productivity losses, as we geared up our termite technicians for a spring that was delayed. Frankly, you can wait and see what happens in the first quarter before staffing and training. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased slightly, 320,000 totaling 10.2 million. Depreciation was 3.3 million and amortization of intangible was 6.9 million. For the full year amortization of intangibles typically from the value assigned to acquire customer contract will represent a significant after tax non-cash charge of $0.12 this year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased 1.5 million or 1.5% to 32.1% of revenues decreasing from 33.1% from last year. The decrease in cost as a percent of sales is due to reductions made in administrative salaries reflecting realignment of some of our operations and cost containment programs initiated at the corporate offices late last year. Income before income taxes was up 17.7% in the quarter, but unfortunately the tax rate for the quarter climbed over last year coming in at 37.7% for the quarter, where I expect it to remain for the time being. As a result, our net income was up only 11.2%. Our balance sheet remains strong. Despite our best efforts to reinvest more heavily in our business, spending 53.6 million on acquisition of companies in the quarter, we still ended the quarter with 83 million in cash and no debt. We\u2019re confident that there are other great pest control companies to pursue. The deal pipeline is the strongest we have seen in some time. Another interesting facet of this business was working capital, which remain negative despite our strong cash position. We continue to have more customers prepay us for services, $98.5 million in current unearned revenue than those who owe us for current services 72.7 million in trade receivable. What a great business. On another note, we were pleased to have been advised last week that Rollins has once again been selected to the Barron\u2019s 400 Index. This marks the seventh time we have been chosen to the index since its conception in 1997. According to Barron, only about 6% of all North American publicly listed companies are selected to the Barron\u2019s 400 on the basis of their fundamental standing. This underscores the overall strength of our company\u2019s financial result and its great prospect. Before I turn the call back to Gary, let me express our appreciation and thank you to all our associates and others whose hard work and dedication contributed to a challenging quarter and are committed to producing another record year. We also thank our customers, suppliers and shareholders for their continued support. Global warming or not, spring has arrived, the phones are ringing, and we\u2019re very excited about our prospects for the balance of 2014. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Gary. Gary: Thank you, Harry. We\u2019re now ready to open the call for any questions that you might have. Rollins: Thank you, Harry. We\u2019re now ready to open the call for any questions that you might have. Question: and: Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ll begin our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jamie Clement with Sidoti. Please go ahead. Jamie Clement : Can you hear me? Sidoti & Company: Can you hear me? Gary:  Yes. Rollins:  Yes. Jamie Clement : Okay. Good morning. Sidoti & Company: Okay. Good morning. Gary Rollins : Hey, Jamie. Welcome back. Jamie Clement : I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. The warm weather will help me. Although we have not seen it yet, although I did see some ads recently. Anyway, I wanted to ask about the -- another new partnership you announced with the CDC, there\u2019ve been a couple over the years. Mosquito is obviously a real problem in this country, particularly with respect to West Nile virus. I think the city of Dallas obviously had a real rough situation last summer. Are there better protocols in place from a mosquito control perspective that you feel you can offer the public? Or is it a little too early to really comment on that sort of thing, and the outcome of any kind of relationship with CDC? Sidoti & Company: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. The warm weather will help me. Although we have not seen it yet, although I did see some ads recently.

Are there better protocols in place from a mosquito control perspective that you feel you can offer the public? Or is it a little too early to really comment on that sort of thing, and the outcome of any kind of relationship with CDC? Gary Rollins : Jamie, the protocols have not improved or changed to a great degree. I guess the application equipment of the blowers have improved, I think which has helped improve productivity. And then really the application process, but there\u2019s new, no new wonder chemical that\u2019s come out that\u2019s drastically changed mosquito control. Jamie Clement : Gary, I mean, would you \u2013 in years past, and I\u2019m going to rely on your experience here, is awareness caused by, last summer\u2019s mosquito situation. Is that something would tend to help a company like yours the following year? Sidoti & Company: Gary, I mean, would you \u2013 in years past, and I\u2019m going to rely on your experience here, is awareness caused by, last summer\u2019s mosquito situation. Is that something would tend to help a company like yours the following year? Gary:  Well, I think to some degree. I think you really got the big lift last year. I think what changed is that the reason -- my interpretation of the data is that you have satisfied customers and they tell their neighbor. And we are -- automatically we assume that the last year\u2019s customer\u2019s going to continue and have a very-very high retention rate of the customers. But I think it works. I mean, and people talking at parties and so forth that they got their backyard back. And I think it\u2019s a very effective and beneficial service. I think that\u2019s more -- you\u2019re going to have publicity as a result of West Nile virus but our experience is, I think been more just the general knowledge of the consumer and the fact that it really works well. Rollins:  Well, I think to some degree. I think you really got the big lift last year. I think what changed is that the reason -- my interpretation of the data is that you have satisfied customers and they tell their neighbor. And we are -- automatically we assume that the last year\u2019s customer\u2019s going to continue and have a very-very high retention rate of the customers. But I think it works. I mean, and people talking at parties and so forth that they got their backyard back. And I think it\u2019s a very effective and beneficial service. I think that\u2019s more -- you\u2019re going to have publicity as a result of West Nile virus but our experience is, I think been more just the general knowledge of the consumer and the fact that it really works well. Harry Cynkus : It is one service \u2013 I think it has the highest retention numbers of any of our service offerings. So, we have proven to our customers over and over again that we provide a very effective mosquito service but there\u2019s still high skepticism and I think it\u2019ll make up less than 2% of our business last year, probably under 20 million in revenue or around 20 million in revenue. Gary: And one other good aspect of it is it helps us get pest control, ongoing pest control. Rollins: And one other good aspect of it is it helps us get pest control, ongoing pest control. Jamie Clement : Sure. Free advertising. Sidoti & Company: Sure. Free advertising. Gary: Yeah. It gives us a nose in the tent, so to speak. And it\u2019s the only service that I can ever remember where people make speeches on your behalf at a neighborhood barbeque. I think it\u2019s just the customers just really love it and it works. Rollins: Yeah. It gives us a nose in the tent, so to speak. And it\u2019s the only service that I can ever remember where people make speeches on your behalf at a neighborhood barbeque. I think it\u2019s just the customers just really love it and it works. Harry Cynkus : We don\u2019t like to brag, but we got rid of their bed bugs. Jamie Clement : Okay. Sidoti & Company: Okay. Harry: I always mention about that. Cynkus: I always mention about that. Jamie Clement : I will get back in the queue and allow others to ask questions. Thanks very much for your time as always. Sidoti & Company: I will get back in the queue and allow others to ask questions. Thanks very much for your time as always. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Box : Good morning, Gary, and...  KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning, Gary, and... Gary Rollins : Good morning. Joe Box :  Congrats, Harry, on the birth of your second grandchild.  KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Congrats, Harry, on the birth of your second grandchild. Harry Cynkus : Yes, still waiting here for the text. It should be coming soon. Joe Box : Great, good for you. Just a question for you on the operating margin. Obviously, pretty solid, up 140 basis points year-over-year. And then up 40 basis points from 1Q '12 which I know is exceptionally strong. Can you maybe just give us a sense of some of the bigger drivers that were behind the leverage in the quarter? KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great, good for you. Just a question for you on the operating margin. Obviously, pretty solid, up 140 basis points year-over-year. And then up 40 basis points from 1Q '12 which I know is exceptionally strong. Can you maybe just give us a sense of some of the bigger drivers that were behind the leverage in the quarter? Harry Cynkus :  Yeah. In analyzing it, we saw just about every expense item as a percentage of revenue actually decreased a little. I mean, we I think put in some good -- and have always had good cost controls. But everyone was certainly focused on it in the first quarter with the revenue not coming on with the cold weather. So, I think people were conscious about not getting free with the spending. I think that the one that was a little more significant that I mentioned was on the fleet side, 3 years ago we switched from being primarily closed end leases to open end leases. And so, we\u2019re starting to turn over some of those, the higher-mileage vehicles. And quite frankly, we\u2019ve had some nice gains and the sales -- the used small pickup truck market is strong. And that probably was the only thing that really popped out noteworthy. And then -- going the opposite direction our termite service wages were high simply because the termite revenue didn\u2019t come in, and you start adding the people because we have to find them, hire them, and train them. So we expect -- we\u2019ll continue to focus on cost containment and the fleet can be somewhat variable, but more and more vehicles will be coming off, open-end leases where we\u2019ll have the opportunity if the market stays strong. Joe Box : Understood, thanks for that. One last one, then I\u2019ll turn it over. Gary, I think you said earlier that you\u2019re a bit disappointed with the revenue growth that you saw in 1Q. I know that this is going to be tough to measure, but is there some way you could try to quantify the weather impact? And then going forward, did you see a nice snap back as the weather broke. And maybe if you could just give some commentary on where leads are trending by business to give us a sense of that snap back.  KeyBanc Capital Markets : Understood, thanks for that. One last one, then I\u2019ll turn it over. Gary, I think you said earlier that you\u2019re a bit disappointed with the revenue growth that you saw in 1Q. I know that this is going to be tough to measure, but is there some way you could try to quantify the weather impact? And then going forward, did you see a nice snap back as the weather broke. And maybe if you could just give some commentary on where leads are trending by business to give us a sense of that snap back. Gary Rollins : The best way -- and we\u2019ve tried to chase this weather situation for decades. But I think we have the best impact now in using Google\u2019s word searches that you can see. You\u2019ve got a relatively stable data and that can tell you how many hits that they have on termites, how many they had on roaches, how many, the key pest. And I think that\u2019s probably the best way we have of measuring demand. And then it\u2019s been very helpful because without some way of trying to determine this, you could discontinue a winning advertising campaign or you could stick with a not too effective advertising campaign because you had great weather. So, we\u2019re feeling better about using that as a barometer. We used to look at retail sales of aerosols and things like that. So, Nielsen had statistics on how well Raid sold and Decon and those kind of things. But that was kind of -- certainly there was a big lag, time lies with that. And compared to the Google approach I think it was just not as effective. Harry Cynkus : Yeah. We\u2019ve looked at, and I don\u2019t know how accurate this is. I heard it in a hallway conversation yesterday that one of the things as Gary just said is we look at Google searches and use that as a barometer for how we\u2019re doing. And I think the number I heard that termite Google searches were down 25% in the first quarter, and we were down 25%. So, I guess I should feel good about that, but a double-digit decrease is always hard to overcome. We haven\u2019t really put numbers, I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s 1% or 2%, that our revenue would have been better off if the weather was XYZ. But it had an impact, but the beauty and the strength of this business comes from the recurring revenue. And the business -- largest service line is commercial business and if you have a restaurant, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s January or June. You don\u2019t want the cockroach going across the dining room floor. So, I would say from a commercial standpoint, maybe there was some specials we didn\u2019t do because it was cold, certainly impacted the fumigation business. That costs us probably half a point. Could have been -- termite could have been up 2%, 3% instead of down way percent. So, it could have added up 1% to 2%. Gary:  Well there is one positive about cold weather and that\u2019s that the rats move in. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in this business and we just try to interpret to data as well as we can, but the rodent calls do go up as it gets colder. Rollins:  Well there is one positive about cold weather and that\u2019s that the rats move in. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in this business and we just try to interpret to data as well as we can, but the rodent calls do go up as it gets colder. Joe Box : Understood. Thanks guys, and nice job on a tough weather environment.  KeyBanc Capital Markets : Understood. Thanks guys, and nice job on a tough weather environment. Gary: Thank you. Rollins: Thank you. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Gary: Okay, I don\u2019t think we've got any other people who want to ask questions. Rollins: Okay, I don\u2019t think we've got any other people who want to ask questions. Operator :  I do apologize, I am showing we do have some. Harry Cynkus : Yes, we do. Gary: Okay. Rollins: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Clement with Sidoti. Please go ahead. Jamie:  Hey, Gary and Harry. Hello again. Gary, I wanted to -- you mentioned new home starts with respect to HomeTeam. Obviously, my understanding is that you don\u2019t make a heck of a lot of money installing the Taexx tubes into the walls, but it\u2019s really about fundamentally those homes being sold and moved into and those customers becoming recurring revenue customers. So, how has that process looked as housing construction started in earnest, let\u2019s say, two years ago or so? A lot of those, some of those homes have been sold, some of them haven\u2019t yet. How has that HomeTeam business playing out from a timing perspective and are you pleased? Clement:  Hey, Gary and Harry. Hello again. Gary, I wanted to -- you mentioned new home starts with respect to HomeTeam. Obviously, my understanding is that you don\u2019t make a heck of a lot of money installing the Taexx tubes into the walls, but it\u2019s really about fundamentally those homes being sold and moved into and those customers becoming recurring revenue customers.

How has that HomeTeam business playing out from a timing perspective and are you pleased? Gary: I think the telling orders will be Q2, Q3. Last year, we did 81,000 new installs spread across during the year. Whether you\u2019ve installed, with the system installed, typically when the house is sold, it doesn\u2019t necessarily automatically get turned on. Rollins: I think the telling orders will be Q2, Q3. Last year, we did 81,000 new installs spread across during the year. Whether you\u2019ve installed, with the system installed, typically when the house is sold, it doesn\u2019t necessarily automatically get turned on. Jamie: Right. Clement: Right. - Sidoti & Company: Right. Gary: Just like our regular customers who usually is an event (ph), that will drive them to the phone. So, they didn\u2019t see the pest pressure in those homes in the first quarter. I think their -- I don\u2019t have the number in front of me, I want to say their growth of new customers in Q1 might have been about 6%. But last year, their installs were up 30%. So, but we again, we didn\u2019t have the pest pressure in January, February and March. So I would -- we would expect to see some very strong new customer acquisition in Q2 and Q3 at HomeTeam. They have a pretty much lock in that customer. If that customer wants pest control and someone else calls on them, they don\u2019t have the key to the box. So, we\u2019re waiting for them. We\u2019re reaching out to them, and I think it pretends well for HomeTeam\u2019s future with the growing customer base that they've built. Rollins: Just like our regular customers who usually is an event (ph), that will drive them to the phone. So, they didn\u2019t see the pest pressure in those homes in the first quarter.

We\u2019re reaching out to them, and I think it pretends well for HomeTeam\u2019s future with the growing customer base that they've built. Harry Cynkus : One other good aspect about HomeTeam is the retention is greater of those people that take the pest control service, because they\u2019ve made an investment. I mean they feel like they own, and they do. I mean they own the system. So, I think that makes a stickier customer, and then also the fact that you can apply the materials from the outside and you don\u2019t -- if there\u2019s not a problem inside, this is just more convenient. So, this is really a very good customer for us when they do sign up. Jamie: Okay. Thank you very much for the additional color. Appreciate it. Clement: Okay. Thank you very much for the additional color. Appreciate it. - Sidoti & Company: Okay. Thank you very much for the additional color. Appreciate it. Harry Cynkus : Thank you. Operator :  And our next question comes from the line of Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Gary: Good morning. Rollins: Good morning. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : Two questions, first -- over the past few years you\u2019ve implemented new pricing tools for both the residential and the commercial side. Should we expect anything in terms of new pricing actions this year, whether for residential or commercial? And can you quantify what that impact might potentially be? Harry Cynkus :  Well, as we do every year, we test the pricing in January and February and analyze it in March and April to determine what kind of price increase we may be passing along. The initial results I\u2019m told from this year\u2019s test has shown no change in elasticity. So, the executive team will be meeting here shortly to determine the actual pricing action that we will take. Sure there will be a price increase that will be rolled out in June and July. The pricing tools on the commercial side already have been rolled out. The initial numbers I\u2019ve seen this first quarter, we\u2019ve seen improved pricing, average pricing. We haven\u2019t really I haven\u2019t seen any deep dive analytics out of the analytic team as yet, but on a very top level basis, our average price has gone up. So we\u2019re encouraged that the -- there\u2019s no reason why those tools, if we use them and keep the discipline in place, forcing people to use them and manage them that shouldn\u2019t yield stronger results. I don\u2019t see really any, directionally any change in what we\u2019ve been able to do historically when it comes to pricing. Gary: One of the things that you have a second facet when you make that new sale and we do have pricing tools that are very helpful, especially commercial wise, especially to the new employees that it just gives them a better perspective as to how to price properly. But the other side of the equation is closure. And that works both for the commercial, as well as the residential through our call centers. And with a zip plus four, we really have a better way of analyzing the demographics. And in some instances, if we get the kind of closure lift that we want, you might have a 5% price decrease, but we\u2019ve got a wonderful situation with our call center because we can measure closure and average price and all. I mean, it\u2019s like a laboratory. We don\u2019t have to rely on the data being passed down the line from 400 branches. So, we\u2019re very -- we\u2019re as excited about closure improvement as we are average price improving. Rollins: One of the things that you have a second facet when you make that new sale and we do have pricing tools that are very helpful, especially commercial wise, especially to the new employees that it just gives them a better perspective as to how to price properly. But the other side of the equation is closure. And that works both for the commercial, as well as the residential through our call centers.

I mean, it\u2019s like a laboratory. We don\u2019t have to rely on the data being passed down the line from 400 branches. So, we\u2019re very -- we\u2019re as excited about closure improvement as we are average price improving. Harry Cynkus : One of the tools, I\u2019m not sure everyone is aware of it that we did roll out in the first quarter in the residential side, we\u2019ve been pricing by zip code. I think that goes back five, six years. And we took that to the next level where it\u2019s zip code plus four, so we can drill down into better data by -- within a large zip code, the demographics can change pretty dramatically. So, we think we can better price, come up with a better price per neighborhood than we have in the past. And I think that could very well be one of the things that are helping us in our closure that we\u2019re pricing it more accurately into the neighborhood. Gary Rollins : You don\u2019t like to have an answer that we don\u2019t know. Certainly, it doesn\u2019t make me feel very comfortable in my position. But closure is impacted. We know that our use of HomeSuite and BizSuite on our iPads and all is improving closure, because we\u2019re making a more professional presentation and especially for new employees, again, that it just gives them a roadmap to make a very professional presentation. So, it\u2019s kind of hard to decide how much is HomeSuite and BizSuite have to do with closure, how much is better more finite pricing during the closure. And when I made the comment in the presentation, our idea is to keep coming out with these new programs that we know will make a contribution and not be weather dependent. And I think part of the reason we have such a good quarter was with a big lead decrease is that these individual initiatives are working. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you, that\u2019s really helpful. Just one last first question regarding acquisitions, it seems like the pipeline is building. You just bought two companies in Australia. Can you talk about -- going forward are you focusing in terms of M&A in Australia, in the U.S.? Where are you focusing on and when can we sort of see, I guess the next wave of acquisitions? Harry Cynkus : I think the pipeline is strong here in the states as well. Healthcare cost continues to rise for everyone. It certainly has a bigger impact on the regional and smaller pest control companies. And I think they\u2019re seeing that, and that higher cost comes directly out of that owner\u2019s pocket. And they don\u2019t necessarily know how to \u2013 or don\u2019t feel they can necessarily pass it along. But in addition to that, I think something else that we are seeing or realizing and feeling is that the larger companies that can take advantage of the Internet are gaining an advantage, I had someone recently tell me that the business has changed, and a lot of the pest control companies have been in are late second-generation companies. And the way you acquire customers has changed. And the smaller company isn\u2019t keeping up with social media and Twitter and LinkedIn and search engine optimization and all the other buzzwords. And I think they\u2019re getting -- some of them are coming to a realization that times have changed and it might be better, it might be a good time to move on. So, we shall see, but we\u2019re encouraged with the number of inquiries and us reaching out and touching people that we might see a pickup in acquisitions here in the States. Gary Rollins : I think you make a good point, Harry. Yellow Pages just doesn\u2019t do the same job it did five years ago, the conventional media, radio and television. People are buying different, people are shopping differently than they were before. And I think what happens to these smaller companies is they try to get involved in the internet and they find out it\u2019s very expensive. And they don\u2019t see a lot of improvement and they leave. So there's a quite a bit of churn in the internet as far as these small to medium sized companies. So I think, Harry, you hit it on the head. Things are just different than they were before and it\u2019s very difficult for them to compete with social media. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : All right, great. Thanks for the color. Thanks, both of you. Operator : And I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. Please continue. Gary: Okay. No more questions. Well, we\u2019d like to thank you again for joining us. And we\u2019re excited about having another good year and we look forward to sharing with you our results next quarter. So, thanks again. Rollins: Okay. No more questions. Well, we\u2019d like to thank you again for joining us. And we\u2019re excited about having another good year and we look forward to sharing with you our results next quarter. So, thanks again.

Management will make some opening remarks and then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you, Marilynn and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us on our second quarter 2014 conference call. Harry will read our forward-looking statement and the disclaimer and then we\u2019ll begin. Harry Cynkus : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made in this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2013 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. We had another good quarter with revenue growing 5.3% to $369.4 million, compared to $315.8 million in the second quarter last year. Net income increased 13.5% to $40.9 million with EPS of $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $36 million and $0.25 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2013. Revenues for the first six months rose 5% to $682.8 million, compared to $650.5 million for the same period of last year. Net income grew 12.6% to $66.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to net income of $59.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the same period, an increase of 15%. While we would like to hit higher revenue growth for the quarter, we\u2019re pleased with a 45% follow through of profit before taxes from each dollar of revenue increased in the quarter and for the first half of this year. We continue to see strong growth in our commercial pest control business with revenues up 8.1%, residential pest control sequential growth due to softer than expected customer demand came in at 3.9%. Our termite service line was up 4.2% which was helped by our Australian acquisition but there is no slowing down in our bed bug business which grew 18% over last year with revenues of over $14 million for the quarter. We are continuing to see solid growth in residential demand which now represents almost 40% of this business, although commercial continues to grow as well. Year-to-date revenue six months for bed bugs is approximately $26 million. As we continue to invest in initiatives to further grow our business it\u2019s important that we keep our marketing expenditures in balance with seasonal demand. The challenge is to maintain a good lead acquisition cost in the pay search channels while continuing to refine our ability to identify and attract the most desired consumer base. In this regard it\u2019s encouraging that we\u2019re growing our business organically as more consumers visit our website and are selecting our brands. We continue to build out the content of this valuable piece of real estate. A little over a year ago we launched our Orkin\u2019s pest control down to a science team as our national marketing campaign where we highlighted the Orkin man and his vast knowledge of pest. In addition to our television and radio advertising we have put great emphasis on supporting the campaign via our website at orkin.com. This quarter we re-launched this site. It now has both a new look and provides a greater distinction between Orkin\u2019s residential and commercial service offerings versus all the other competition. There are key components on orkin.com that both educate consumers and demonstrate Orkin\u2019s leading ability to handle all types of pest and control related problems. We continue to improve our site which now includes a new and improved pest library, customer expectation videos, and highlights of Orkin\u2019s award winning training. Our new pest library is more robust with actual pest photos into more illustrations and pest videos covering numerous topics including dangerous pest in your home, when to request a termite inspection and so forth. In mid April we launched three new customer expectation videos that show what customers can expect when their Orkin man or woman shows up to perform pest control services. These have proven to be highly popular with our prospective customers. These residential and commercial videos highlight our ongoing progression of three critical practices that are conducted to give our customers the peace of mind that comes with year around pest protection, we call it A.I.M. This acronym describes these activities that our technicians follow. First, our technicians assess the situation in a customer\u2019s home or property to determine what the problems are. Next, is to implement specific science driven solutions based on their findings. And finally, to monitor future pest activity and resolves to make sure our actions are working. Our new website also accomplishes a better mobile experience and will be adjusting its content based on what device you\u2019re viewing via tablets, Smartphone, or desktop PC. These new site improvements are contributing to improve lead conversion while supporting our overall national marketing campaign, and are good example of not being satisfied with the status quo. We\u2019ve also expanded our advertising reach this year to include value added opportunities. Recent research shows that our marketing folks at certain sports have a better chance of reaching our target audience. So if you see an Orkin\u2019s logo during a NHL play-off, PGA tournament or Major League Baseball game, your eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks on you. This advertising is generating solely at the networks discretion, so you never know exactly when or where the advertisements will be shown. But look for them to pop-up when you\u2019re captivated by your favorite sport team. Result [ph] also looking at improving our ability to get to a different audience via YouTube, and this year we have created three different campaigns with a goal of gaining views and engagement and driving consumers to our website. The viewership has been as good as we expected and while it\u2019s still in the early stages in this newer channel, too quick for us to celebrate but overtime we look forward to affordable lead conversion as this new audience routinely comes to the site. This is another example of our quest to be better through innovative marketing approaches that helps distinguish ourselves from the smaller competition who don\u2019t have the resources or expertise to pursue these opportunities. Let me comment a little further on that point. As stated often, we are continuing to aggressively pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions. In conversation with many smaller and medium sized companies vested, they are sharing if their world has changed so much that they either don\u2019t have the knowledge, energy or resources to invest in building their brand via the new digital and social media world. Being the industry\u2019s largest gives us many advantages in this regard, and we believe that this also will create a window of opportunity acquisition lies with these companies. As mentioned previously, we established our own in-house analytics team last fall. And their data mining and number crunching is well underway. We plan to test some of our findings in the fourth quarter with the expectation of developing marketing strategies that will help spur next year\u2019s growth. As we began the year, we anticipated some slowdown with HomeTeam\u2019s installs based on the new home construction outlook for 2014. We\u2019re pleased however that HomeTeam\u2019s installs are up modestly and we\u2019re seeing strong improvement in their profitability, which is up more than 40%. This is in part of result of the activation of our Tubes in the Wall Systems by new customers coupled with a restructuring of HomeTeam\u2019s field operations. Installs were up 3.7% in the quarter and 5.5% for the first half of the year. To bring up-to-date [ph] on our CRM branch administrative operating system as I mentioned in late January, we were doing testing in a number of different business environments. However, we had two final hurdles that needed to be addressed before operations would give the go ahead to roll the system out to branches beyond the pilots. Number one of these obstacles was completing our daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports which will now be near a real-time updating data hourly and accessible to the branch managers PC, iPad or phone. We\u2019re pleased to report that that went live June 16. The other requirement was its functionality of the commercial handheld iPhone App had to be working properly. That has been completed as well with over 150 users now with bait station scanning ability. We\u2019re ready to start implementing our new system with a first tranche of non-pilot branches to roll out in August, September and October. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the branch operating system development, since we originally deployed the software and testing in pilot branches in January 2013, we have made over 1200 additions, changes and deletions. It is probably not accurate to refer to the system as service week much longer because we\u2019ve done so much customization. In fact, we\u2019ll be having an internal naming contest shortly to name our proprietary CRM system. By year end we expect to have the 50 branches online in addition to the 29 that we currently have, or almost 80 branches. The full roll out of the system for Orkin will take 18 months with a bulk of branches occurring in 2015. Our other brands will follow afterwards. As we\u2019ve said in the past, once fully implemented we believe that this system will be a real game changer for our company. This quarter we are pleased to have three South American franchises to our roaster during the quarter. All three will offer commercial and residential pest control and termite services. The first two companies are located in Brazil, and the third franchise is located in Paraguay. All three will be carrying the mantle of the great Orkin brands. In closing, I\u2019d like to reiterate our commitment to being the best pest control company in the world providing residential and commercial customers with extraordinary pest control service. We\u2019re focused on our initiatives to achieve this goal and remain enthusiastic about the numerous opportunities we have, both domestically and internationally. With that said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Harry who will walk you through the financials. Harry Cynkus : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call. It\u2019s good to have a normal conference call, no snowstorm, no burns [ph], just good numbers. For those here last quarter and are curious, my daughter delivered a healthy baby girl minutes following last quarter\u2019s call, mother and Willa Rose are doing fine. Second quarter revenues were $369.4 million, representing 5.3% revenue growth. We had growth across all service lines but not the sequential quarter-to-quarter growth that we prefer to see this time of the year, more about that in a minute. However, as Gary pointed out, we did a good job in converting that incremental revenue to profit and cash. Net income increased 13.5% to $40.9 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same last year. For the first six months of 2014 revenues rose 5% to $682.7 million, compared to $650.5 million last year. Net income for the first six months of 2014 was $66.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to the same period last year representing a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share year-to-date. Net cash provided by operating activities is strong this year, increasing 23% to nearly $90 million. We ended the quarter with $101.5 million cash in the bank, and no debt. Fundamentally our business remains solid. For the first time since 2008 we saw some softness in leads, partly because of the late spring and some uncertainty in consumer demand as the retail industry confirms. As we move up to income band, intentionally with our rates, we attract less in the lower income category which you often don\u2019t retain long enough to recover your acquisition and start-up costs. The results of this strategy can be seen in both of our continuing closure improvement, as well as better price realization. Long-term, we should also see higher retention as well. The analytics work we are doing in this area should pay big dividends in the future. Despite decrease in leads we saw increase in sales. Overall, we continue to see improved customer satisfaction and retention which are the key indicators of long-term health of our business. Clearly, we are maintaining our positive momentum within the important drivers of our business. As Gary has said before, we are pleased, just never satisfied. Last quarter we ran our annual price increase test which showed little change in the elasticity. Price increase eligibility is determined based on the tenure of the customer, variance in the customer\u2019s price for the current rate card and contract terms. In June, Orkin and some of our other brands implemented their traditional annual price increase program for eligible residential and commercial customers. HomeTeam\u2019s price increase program rolled out July 1. As Orkin\u2019s was rolled out partially in the quarter, the impact on revenue for the quarter was minimal, probably in the four times to five times of a percent range, and will more favorably impact us in the third quarter. We are currently anticipating approximately $17 million to $19 million over the next 12 months from this pricing action. Canada revenue was up better than 7% from the quarter before impact of currency. The weakness in the Canadian dollar continues to negatively impact our overall revenue improvement, reducing it approximately 1.5% this quarter. So acquisitions more than offset it contributing better than 1.5% to our revenue. Let\u2019s talk about the service lines that make up our business. Our commercial pest control is the largest provider in North America, and our fastest growing service line representing nearly 41% of our revenue. Excluding fumigation commercial pest control grew 8.1% this quarter, 7.3% after taking into account fumigation which was up 5%. Retention was excellent with some of the best numbers I ever recall. We are very pleased with this performance. When I talk about our commercial business in the past I sometimes distinguish with and without fumigation. For those new to the company, the reason being \u2013 while the fumigation business is a small part of our overall business, less than 2.5%, and makes up less than 7% of our commercial pest control business, the revenue can fluctuate greatly from quarter-to-quarter. Food manufacturing and processing fumigations are not often scheduled to occur at the same time from year-to-year. This fluctuation in the business can distort the quarter-to-quarter comparisons. With joint portfolio [ph] in the third quarter and on a Friday it was an ideal weekend to schedule large plant fumigations, and as a result, we saw a number of customers delaying work until that particular weekend. From a fumigation portion of our commercial business clouds the view of our commercial business I\u2019ll mention it, and when it doesn\u2019t I won\u2019t. Our residential pest control business, the original cornerstone of our company represent approximately 40% of our business this quarter. This quarter we saw a 3.9% growth equal to the first quarter. This service line is far more dependent on leads as the potential customer usually waits until they have a pest sighting, they pick up the phone or go to the computer and contact us. While we add it to our customer base sequentially, as well as over the second quarter last year, the softness in demand here certainly hurt us from being able to grow as expected. Despite the late spring, retention was flat to last year while customer satisfaction improved. The last service line, termite, which represents 19% of our business in the quarter bounced back from last quarter\u2019s growth rate to more respectable sounding 4.2%. Excluding our Australian acquisition, termite grew 1.6% versus a decrease of 1.1% in the first quarter. This year we didn\u2019t have a good swarm season, but fortunately termite is the smallest part of our business. Remember only half of that 19% is new completions, with the balance being very profitable, recurring revenue from renewal payments. We strategically placed greater emphasis on pest control services back in 1998 due to the higher claim risk and lower growth potential in termite, and to concentrate on growing our commercial business. For those waiting anxiously to learn about our bed bug business, it was up over 18% to $14.4 million for the quarter, with residential and commercial growing close to the same rate. Bed bugs provide a great opportunity for us to introduce our other services into accounts that have not considered regular pest control. [Indiscernible] if I didn\u2019t talk further about HomeTeam which has profit-wise outperformed even our lofty expectations so far this year. Install growth has moderated with 22,400 new installs made in the quarter, up 3.7% for the quarter and 5.5% year-to-date. As a result of incremental margins from new customers, significantly better pricing on their termite pre-treat work, good expense control and cost taken out of their overhead structure, HomeTeam improved their profit contributions to the company better than 40% this quarter and year-to-date. Gross margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 50.6% for the second quarter versus 50.3% in the prior year due to primarily favorable termite and casualty claim experience, and good cost controls across most spending categories which more than offset a decrease in overall productivity as the company\u2019s events [ph] of what turned out to be a very, very late spring. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased 800,000, an increase of 8.6% increasing one-tenth of a percent to 2.9% of revenue. Depreciation increased $100,000 to $3.8 million and amortization of intangibles increased $700,000 to $6.9 million. The increase in intangible amortization relates to the acquisitions made over the course of the last 12 months. For the full year amortization of intangibles typically from the value assigned to customer contracts gained in an acquisition will represent a significant after-tax non-cash charge of $0.12 this year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $1 million or nine-tenths of a percent to 29.9% of revenues which is favorable from 31.2% for the second quarter last year. The decrease in margin percent is due to reductions made in administrative salaries, reflecting realignment of some of our operations, and cost containment programs initiated at the corporate offices late last year, along with reductions in bad debt expense. Last year addition expenses were incurred which did not reoccur to our professional services related to our commercial pricing project, and last year\u2019s incremental spend for the new advertising campaign. Tax rate for the quarter came in at 37.8% for the quarter, no breaks this quarter and no corporate tax reform on the horizon. Yesterday the company declared it\u2019s regularly quarterly cash dividend of $0.105 per shares, earlier this month we announced that the company repurchased a 192,583,000 shares. In total, 4.7 million additional shares may be purchased under the shares repurchase program. We continue to operate from a solid foundation. We have confidence in our fundaments, the company is performing well, the balance sheet is strong. As always, our first priority for our remarkable cash generation capabilities remains investing in what we know best, pest control and only pest control. We look forward to announcing our next acquisition shortly. With the year half over, we are well positioned for a great 2014. I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Let me express our continuing appreciation to all the Rollins associates whose hard work is behind our outstanding results. We likewise are most appreciative of our customers who make everything we do possible. Thank you for your time and interest. And with that, I now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. We\u2019re now ready to open the call for any questions that you might have. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jamie Clement with Sidoti. Jamie Clement \u2013 Sidoti: Gary, Harry, good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Harry Cynkus : Good morning. Jamie Clement \u2013 Sidoti: Gary, I have to ask you a question, this is the highest revenue operating income, net income, and EPS quarter you all have ever reported, I sensed however, a slight bit of disappointment in your voice on a couple of things. And \u2013 that\u2019s a little unusual, I\u2019m listening to these calls for a while\u2026 Gary Rollins : I need to practice more, that\u2019s the case. Jamie Clement \u2013 Sidoti: Yes, and I was just wondering if it sounds like the lead generation situation was obviously \u2013 mother nature obviously has an impact on that and obviously, the marketing strategy. Gary Rollins : Mostly you get up for our season and just kind of \u2013 like retail, the Christmas season, and we were disappointed that the demand was not more robust, our branch marketing with suppliers and competitors confirmed that this was a real phenomenon, it wasn\u2019t a result of our advertising not working. And we have a couple of ways, if we check our advertising, one is kind of what I call the generic search on the web, how many people search for roaches or ants or termites, and so we kind of compare this year versus last year. And we have other ways that we look at \u2013 testing as far as I have mentioned, our suppliers, and our competitors. So \u2013 we\u2019re satisfied that this wasn\u2019t a Rollins thing, this was an industry situation. But as Harry said, we did a great job converting, I think that speaks loudly to the programs that we\u2019ve initiated in the past couple of years and we were fortunate that it all came together and the results from our earnings point of view were very good. Jamie Clement \u2013 Sidoti: Yes, absolutely. And that\u2019s why I asked the question because on the surface \u2013 and obviously, the months of April and May were not particularly warm by recent historical standards, so I just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing something here. And obviously, I know you are your own harshest critics. Gary Rollins : Yes. I need to work harder because I was \u2013 and the Board was pleased. So my bosses are pleased, they are generally Harry and I are pleased but\u2026 Jamie Clement \u2013 Sidoti: Okay, alright, very good. Thank you very much for your time. Gary Rollins : Okay. Harry Cynkus : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Egan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Egan \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Harry Cynkus : Good morning. Sean Egan \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : I just had a quick question on your affix to shift your customer mix to a higher income demographic. Can you please help us explain any potential impacts that might have on the P&L, possibly a higher margin through higher average ticket realized, are there any offsets to that such as fewer customers? Can you just kind of walk us through any of those potential impacts? Gary Rollins : Yes, certainly. Everyone gets their fair share of some of these leads. We priced \u2013 we\u2019re proud of our pricing. And so \u2013 if you mismatch premium pricing with customers who aren\u2019t willing to pay the price, we see it often in retention, and the customers might only take two or three services and be gone in three or four months as opposed to a year. Your customer acquisition costs, you\u2019re not going to recover the additional cost and time put in until the initial services. It just makes for a unprofitable customer for you. So what we want to do is, make sure we are appealing to the customers who value the service will stay longer. If you\u2019re successful with the strategy and we certainly saw it in the first quarter because while our leads were down our total sales were up. And what you do is, you spend more time on the phone with customers who will be appealing to you and appreciate your service, so you\u2019ll get higher closure percent and better price realization. In both of those we saw, our leads were down, our total sales were up, so the strategy is working. I think we\u2019ll see in six months to a year we should see better retention because we will be bringing less of the customers who turnover more rapidly through the \u2013 into the mix. It\u2019s just \u2013 you have a limited amount of marketing dollars and we are through the data analytics that work that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re getting a lot smarter in spending the money in the right channels, appealing to the right customers. So we\u2019re kind of happy that that has worked out. Harry Cynkus : Let me just add one thing to that. Most of our pest control technicians, further pay is based on productivity. And when you give them a better mix of customers at higher rates, basically they get a raise and when you have customers churning, it\u2019s very disruptive as far as you\u2019re arriving in a scheduling. So, as you stabilize the customers you\u2019ve got a better priced customer, everybody wins. And I think to Gary\u2019s point about retention, I mean, I think he would expect the retention to improve, and I think that\u2019s basically what we saw this past quarter. Sean Egan \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great, thank you. And then just one more, is there any update that you can give us on how Australia is going. Is it ramping better than expected in line? Any color on that would be appreciated. Gary Rollins : We\u2019re obviously \u2013 Australia, it\u2019s a long-term play for us. We\u2019ve done \u2013 we\u2019ve closed now on two acquisitions in Australia. The first one out of the cage is performing below our expectations, some of the contracts are in the hopper [ph] haven\u2019t come on board as fast as we had hoped or projected. So, that\u2019s been a little disappointing but we\u2019ve got a great team there, great prospects, and we\u2019re really excited about them long-term. The second acquisition we closed on Statewide has come out of the gates as game busters, I think their revenues are running 13%, 15% of the big ran this time a year ago. So we\u2019re excited with the team we\u2019re building down there, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate other opportunities. And we think Australia be a great market long-term. Sean Egan \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great, thanks a lot. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Hey Harry and Gary, good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Dan. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Thanks for taking my question. There has been some changes recently in the market, what are you seeing, let\u2019s say in the last three months in terms of the competitive landscape, especially vis-\u00e0-vis your largest competitor, both on the commercial and residential side. Harry Cynkus : I don\u2019t know if we really are seeing any particular difference in the marketplace. I think in ServiceMaster, Terminix, Rentokil, with their brands, Stereotek [ph], Ecolab; we\u2019ve been competing head-to-head with them for a number of years and really I don\u2019t \u2013 our sales team hasn\u2019t reported anything particularly different. I think the one thing we\u2019ve seen maybe a little different \u2013 I think that maybe a little more competition on the acquisition side, some of the prices that are being paid for some of the deals, I scratched my head and questioned how they are modeling to get reasonable returns on the investment but I sorted that. Harry, you\u2019ve got any more to talk? Gary Rollins : Well, the only thing I would comment is \u2013 I think ServiceMaster and Terminix is reorganization certainly. We had to create a little bit of distraction and we didn\u2019t have that but as Harry said we certainly benchmark and we do research but we\u2019re really not seeing any phenomenon out there in the marketplace that somebody has got a silver bullet or has come up with something really unique that\u2019s going to change our market share. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then one last question, Harry, you mentioned that you\u2019re looking something like \u2013 we\u2019re looking for to the next acquisition soon, is there something eminent or was that more of an aspirational comment? Harry Cynkus : They are always aspirational until signature is on the paper. Gary Rollins : Yes, they have a place for people that speculate or the deal they call it jail. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Oh, we don\u2019t want to be there. Alright, thank you very much. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Well, we\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re certainly flattered by your interest and support and we look forward to the next quarter. And we\u2019ll be working hard to improve our business. So, thank you again. Operator : And as a reminder, the replay for this call, which will begin two hours after this call concludes will run for one week. The replay can be heard by dialing 1-888-203-1112 with the passcode of 9319923. Again, that phone number is 1-888-203-1112 and the passcode is 9319923. This will conclude today\u2019s conference.

Harry Cynkus : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, indicating the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2013 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. We\u2019re very pleased to have reported our strongest quarter for the year with revenues growing 6.3% to $384.9 million compared to $362.2 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. Our net income increased 13.6% to $41.1 million with EPS of $0.28 compared to $36.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2013. Revenues for the first nine months rose 5.4% to $1.067 million. Net income grew 13% to $107.7 million or $0.74 per share compared to net income of $95.4 million or $0.65 per diluted share for the same period last year. We\u2019re also pleased to have achieved a 35% flow through of profit before taxes from each dollar of revenue increased in the quarter. This was off a little bit from the 41% flow through year-to-date, but with greater growth comes more related upfront cost. We saw a good growth in our commercial pest control business with revenues up 7%. Residential pest control was up 4.9%. While our termite service line was up 8.2% which for the quarter includes contributions from our recent acquisitions \u2013 Allpest, Statewide and PermaTreat. With this being our last call in 2014 and our year is about over, I thought I\u2019d take a moment and bring you up-to-date on the feel of the new initiatives we\u2019re working that will contributing in 2015. As you may recall approximately a year ago, we established our own in-house analytics team to help us gain greater insight in the customer preferences and to enable us to better formulate our marketing plans and priorities. We felt that this capability was needed to take our company to the next level. Through this group\u2019s efforts, we now have a better understanding of our customer base, their behaviors as well as a greater understanding of our specific business segments. Going forward, we will have more and better data, so more of our decisions can be based on facts versus supposition. As you would expect, this will be an ongoing effort and as we do further testing, substantiating our findings to develop and implement our 2015 marketing initiatives and plans. Historically, one of the strengths of our company has been our marketing efforts. As a result of this new research, our marketing team will be raising the bar next year to drive more business to our brands. We believe that this more sophisticated approach to our marketing will be more cost effective and enable us to meet our goal of stronger single digit revenue growth with double digit profit improvement. The digital world just keeps expanding. Not only are there more devices emerging, but there seems to be a growing trend among TV viewers to cut the proverbial cord either entirely or partially. This was highlighted in the last couple of weeks with HBO announcing their intent to beginning screening content in 2015 which was followed by some more announcement from network giant, CBS. As you may recall our company embraced digital early on and it was currently becoming an even more significant medium to connect with today\u2019s consumers. We believe that there are growing opportunities to various digital touch points including streaming unique video and display. We will be expanding our presence and spend in this area in the New Year. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our knowledge and conventional blogcast media channels to efficiently drive awareness and reference to the Orkin brand among current users and future prospects. Our PR folks will also be raising the bar on plans to more economically build consideration for our brands in the media both nationally and locally in the large communities where we do business. This will be complemented to our use of social media including hosted blogs and live Twitters. At the same time, we will reinforce our scientific pest control team and brand positioning through our valuable partnerships which includes our work with the CDC and our affiliation with over 20 leading zoos and aquariums throughout the United States. And let\u2019s not overlook the old work in Insect Zoo at the Smithsonian. If you\u2019re in the Washington area, you might want to drop by and see their tarantulas. We value our customers highly and want their experience with us to be rewarding from the first consideration of our services to purchase and our service delivery. We will continue to drive communications with customers through various touch points including personal emails and a e-newsletter that is currently distributed to many of our customers. These touch points will help us build and maintain customer loyalty which is critical to all important customer retention. Speaking of retention, our analytics team that I mentioned earlier has also identified many drivers to help improve customer retention which we will be market testing in the New Year. Rollins is a naturally recognized leader in employee training as attested by our having been named one of the top training companies in America over the past 12 years. We\u2019re also a leader in using technology to advance our training efforts. Our new commercial sales training curriculum is one example of how the Rollins learning center is making our training better by partnering more consistently with our field. I know it sounds like a no brainer, but today we\u2019re soliciting more feedback from our frontline employees. Our training employees specialists are working closer with teams or division representatives from a variety of positions to identify what aspects with existing training were effective and what needs to be improved. As an example, teams have tailored our customers sales training to better complement our newly introduced technology of proprietary iPad BizSuite application. Our dedication to succession planning across all divisions and levels at Rollins continues to serve us well as we identify our management talent needed to meet our long-term growth objectives. As an example, recently, we realigned our regions within the Atlantic and Southeast divisions improve our span of control and to achieve other operational efficiencies. We\u2019re able to accomplish this in part by drawing from our bench strength of talent identified through our annual employee ranking and performance tracking software. As a result, Pat Chrzanowski was promoted Vice President of our newly established Northeast Division. Pat joined Orkin\u2019s Atlantic Division in 2007 and has worked his way up to our company through his successful accomplishments and numerously field assignments. At the same time, Freeman Elliott who has led the Atlantic Division since 2010 was recognized to oversee the important Southeast Division which now includes North Carolina and Tennessee. We\u2019re enthusiastic about both of these assignments and have high expectations for accelerating our growth and management improvements for both of these divisions under Pat and Freeman\u2019s leadership. We\u2019re continuing to advance our investments to improve risk management for our company and our employee\u2019s welfare. To that end, we recently brought on a new Director of Safety and Health, Christopher Moss [ph] who will be responsible for developing, implementing and expanding Rollins\u2019 safety and health programs. Chris has already started work on what he calls humanizing safety and has been out in the field interacting with employees across the country gaining their insights. It is our intent for safety to come naturally to everyone with a daily goal that everyone does their job safely. Before handing the call over to Harry, I just wanted to provide an update on a couple of subjects that you may have been wondering about. First of all, HomeTeam, there have been several conflicting and confusing dichotomies in recent weeks concerning the status of the home construction industry. September 17th news release noted that builder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes rose for a fourth consecutive month to a level of 59 on the National Association of Home Builders, Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. But this index brings at the highest level since November 2005, any number above 50 is considered to indicate that more builders view condition is good than poor. But some 24 hours later, the U.S. Commerce Department reported construction starts on new U.S. homes tumbled over 14% in August, pulling back after a surge in July, signaling some shakiness in the housing market recovery. So confidence is up and further government start is down. Acquisition is that we can\u2019t change the reports but we can improve our execution and operating margins. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. We have great confidence in HomeTeam, its people and their ongoing contributions to our company\u2019s overall growth as the housing market further stabilizes. For the third quarter, we experienced a modest 4.3% growth in installs in line with our expectations and anticipate this type of growth in October. We\u2019re pleased that leading builders also have a great confidence in partnering with HomeTeam. As an example, for the fourth consecutive year, HomeTeam earned the nationally acclaimed Partners of Choice Award given by David Weekley Homes for outstanding supplier performance. HomeTeam is the only pest management company to ever receive this well-respective industry award and one of eight companies from approximately 200 suppliers to earn an A in service quality. Bill Justus from David Weekley said it best, earning an award is difficult and what HomeTeam has accomplished winning for four consecutive years is a truly outstanding achievement. Most of you are aware of our acquisition of PermaTreat which was finalize on August 1st. However, I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome this fine team to our business family. They\u2019re a great cost refit for us and helps extend our presence in Northern Virginia. Second, just a quick update on where we are with our CRM branch at administrative operating system. We began the rollout of our first charge of non-pilot branches in August and remain on target with this year\u2019s plan. What was most encouraging about the first non-beta conversion was how smoothly it went. Nothing ever goes perfect, but the number of whoopses [ph] were small and very manageable. Three branches are certainly not a scientific representative sample, but like I said, it was very encouraging. A lot of time and effort has gone into these first plants conversions. And I\u2019d like to thank our team who made it possible while minimizing the pain at the branches. We\u2019re proceeding with a net rollout converting an additional 13 branches. In closing, we are pleased with the progress that we\u2019re continuing to make in advancing our initiatives to be the best service company in the world. For us, this is a journey, not a destination. We are privileged to have a team of employees who are creative, innovative and enthusiastically seizing the opportunities available to our company both today and for the future. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Harry who will walk you through our financials. Harry? Harry Cynkus : Thanks, Garry. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call. What is it about October? Last year, the financial headlines were all about the aftermath of the U.S. Government shutdown, the next looming death sealing breach and what the potential Fed tapering will do to business. This October, it\u2019s all about global growth scares, slowdown in tech, cheap foreign imports, et cetera, et cetera. A lot of headlines. There\u2019s something reassuring about being a pest control company. These type of events just don\u2019t impact our business. Pest control is a recession resistant, but not recession dependent business representing a non-discretionary purchase for commercial in most consumers. But that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t ever have to work hard to produce our results. As we experienced last quarter, we saw continued softness in leads through July. August saw the fourth year-over-year improvement, slight, but a gain nonetheless. Then came September. I always said that spring will come and things will pick up. I just didn\u2019t expect to see it in September, neither did Gary. It\u2019s hard to put an explanation of what has proven to be the best September sales month on record by far. Good weather, but not phenomenal, no particularly good economic signals, if anything the newspapers had negative headlines most of the month, no change in our marketing strategy, but the phones rang off the hook. And our sales associates executed. I\u2019m happy to report that it looks like the positive trend is continuing into October. Last quarter, I said the last time I saw significant slowdown in leads was in 2008 and it appeared that consumers deferred making that pest control call for help for a year. This time, it appears they only deferred it until the fall. Third quarter revenues were $384.9 million, representing 6.3% revenue growth. We saw a continued sequential growth across all of our brands. Net income increased 13.6% to $41.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $36.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period in 2014. Year-to-date revenue is $1.067 million, a 5.4% increase. While net income has increased 13% to $102.8 million. EBITDA totals $205.1 million while EPS has increased 14% to $0.74 per diluted share. We see good momentum with lead growth returning and no significant negative changes in the other fundamentals that support our business \u2013 closure, pricing, customer and employee retention, all working together to achieve that we have for the first nine months as well as for the remainder of the year. Let\u2019s get deeper into the results. This quarter we have seen 6.3% revenue growth among all brands and all service lines. We saw a good growth in our commercial pest control business with revenues up 7%. Residential pest control was up 4.9% while our termite service line was up 8.2% favorably impacted by our acquisitions. Allpest, Statewide and PermaTreat acquisitions accounted for approximately 2% of our overall growth. Our Canadian operations represents better than 7% of our company revenues, had good organic growth. However, the weakening currency impacted our growth this quarter costing us four tenths of 1%. Let\u2019s look at the service lines that make up our business starting with residential pest control. Residential sales are driven by inbound activity, phone calls and web leads. The strong finish in September made it the strongest quarter of the year for residential increasing 4.9%, 4.3% excluding acquisitions. This service line represents 42% of our revenues this quarter. Commercial pest control which makes up 41% of our business was up 7%, 4.6% excluding acquisitions. With the commercial business, you receive less than one tenth as many commercial leads as you do residential. So for them, it\u2019s all about being creative, knocking on doors and making proposals. The impact of the currency exchange was reflected almost exclusively in our commercial business as most of Canada\u2019s business is commercial. Domestically, commercial is up 5.4%. Lastly, our termite business which makes up 16% of our business this quarter enjoyed growth of 8.2% in the third quarter which is strong. The acquisitions played a big part of it. But even excluding them, 3.7% growth for this service was our best quarter so far this year. Last year, we talked about our proprietary sales to HomeSuite, an iPad application in the hands of our sales inspectors. This tool has been successful in helping improve closure as well as enabling us to sell additional auxiliary products. Lastly, when it comes to revenue, we can\u2019t leave out our favorite, bed bugs. While they don\u2019t make the headlines they used to, it continues to be our fastest growing business line having achieved its first $20 million quarter since we began tracking this business in 2009 when we did $24 million in revenue for the entire year. For the quarter, bed bug revenue grew 17.8% to $20.5 million. Interestingly, if you\u2019d look at our bed bug business alone, it would rank among the top 12 pest control companies in the United States. Needless to say, we\u2019re proud that we have been able to successfully build this business and provide our customers with the most needed service. Year-to-date, revenues for bed bugs are approximately $46.5 million and will easily exceed $60 million this year. Gross margin increased to 50.9% for the third quarter versus 50% in the prior year. This is due to primarily favorable termite and casualty claim development, improvement in service salaries. We\u2019re seeing productivity improvement for the first time this year as well as good cost management across most spending categories. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $1.4 million totaling $11.4 million. Depreciation is almost $4.2 million and amortization of intangibles was $7.2 million. We expense all cost as incurred in organically growing our business. However, we are required today of the customer contracts and other intangibles required in acquisitions. And as a result, as of September 30th, we have $150 million in customer contracts and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. Amortization of these costs will remain a significant non-cash charge to the P&L for some time. This year, it will represent a $0.12 charge to earnings. While we\u2019re on the subject of non-cash charges running through a P&L, we have nearly $8 million year-to-date in stock based compensation which will represent $0.04 charge to earnings as well this year. Capital expenditures are running $22.7 million year-to-date which is unusually high for us from a historical perspective, but further testament confirming that although we are not a capital intensive business, we will invest when the opportunity justifies it. The primary driver in the higher than normal capital spend rate was the decision to do a very robust PC refresh ahead of our branch operating system rollout. Sales, general, administrative expenses increased $5.7 million or 5% to 30.8% of revenues decreasing from 31.2% for the third quarter ended 9-30. The decreases in cost as percent of revenues were the result of us being able to make reductions in administrative salaries reflecting realignment at some of our operations and cost containment programs initiated to corporate office late last year. Last year, additional expenses were incurred which did not reoccur for advertising related to our new rollouts. As a result of gearing up for and beginning of the implementation of our branch automation project, we incurred an additional $600,000 in SG&A costs over last year\u2019s run rate. The provision for income tax has returned this quarter to its normalized run rate, 37.6%. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the quarter with $114 million in cash with no debt. We continue to work hard to find opportunities to put back cash to work in what we know best, pest control and only pest control. We have been able to accelerate our acquisitions this year both abroad, Australia and Canada as well as domestically. The deal pipeline is as strong as I\u2019ve seen it in a number of years. But I\u2019m constantly reminded, bad acquisitions at a good price are still bad acquisitions and good acquisitions at a bad are in a good use of our hard earned capital. We continue to remain disciplined. But acquisitions don\u2019t deter us from returning capital to our shareholders both through dividends our share repurchase program. With $114 million in cash and no debt, we certainly have the flexibility to pursue acquisitions, continue to increase our dividends as well as buy back stock. During the quarter, we were active with our share buyback program. Early this month, we announced that the company had repurchased nearly 780,000 shares under the share repurchase program and just over 1 million shares have been repurchased year-to-date. In total, 3.952 million additional shares may be purchased under previously approved programs by the board of directors. The program does not have an expiration date. Yesterday, the board declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock of $10.5 per share payable December 10th to shareholders at record at the close of business in November 10. The board will reexamine the quarterly dividend as it normally does in the regularly scheduled January meeting. This past year marked the 12th year which the increase of our annual dividend by a minimum of 12% each year. We continue to generate more cash than we can wisely redeploy in the business and through stock buybacks. As a result for the third consecutive year, the board declared a special year-end dividend this year payable December 10th to shareholders of record at the close of business November 10th of $0.10. Where did the year go? Hard to believe, 2014 will be drawing to a close. We haven\u2019t come close to exhausting the opportunities we have to grow and improve our business. I look forward to talking to you next quarter in sharing our fourth quarter and record year results. Lastly, let me express our appreciation for a job well done to all of the Rollins associates whose hard work and dedication are behind these outstanding results. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. Harry and I will be happy to address any questions that you all might have. Operator : (Operator instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jamie Clement with Macquarie. Jamie Clement \u2013 Macquarie: Harry, Gary, good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Jamie. Harry Cynkus : Good morning. Jamie Clement \u2013 Macquarie: All right, two questions for me. First of all, Harry, obviously CapEx is trending a little higher than normal. But given the branch system rollouts, should higher still going into next year or is this a level you\u2019d expect to kind of stay out or even declined over the next 18 months or so? Harry Cynkus : No, I would expect it to decline back to more historical trends in the $17 million to $20 million range for the year. Like I said, we did a very robust rollout to improve the branch operating computers which normally we do staggered over a number years. But the capacity and strength of what we needed in the branches with the rollout coming just required a unusual deceleration of that. So no, there\u2019s no big CapEx surprises next year. Jamie Clement \u2013 Macquarie: Okay, very good. And Gary, if I could turn to you. You mentioned some of the data and the news on housing starts and the housing market in general. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you all are not making a lot of money on the actual installation of the Taexx tubes in the wall. I mean in all cases, this is really about recurring revenue from a family that moves into a house. The way I\u2019ve always sort of looked at this is the business, the new leads that you\u2019re generating from HomeTeam, the decision to build this homes was made many, many years ago. So I mean is that the right interpretation in your opinion, in other words, not to get too worked up about short-term stories and data and that kind of thing? Gary Rollins : Well, of course we\u2019re using our data in other areas or all areas. But you hit it on the head as far as the cost related to installs versus the benefit to get me really turn the system on. It\u2019s almost like the razors and razorblade phenomena that you\u2019ve got to put the system in in order to benefit from it, but once you got it installed, we have a customer that has better retention that conventional pest control because the home owner has made an investment, in their mind as far the system, it\u2019s something that they own. And it\u2019s just a lot more sticky in this residential pest control account than there is the conventional account. Harry Cynkus : And it also provides a \u2013 it\u2019s kind of interesting, I think it\u2019s even than the razor and razorblades because five years from now the 83,000, 84,000 plus homes that we installed systems in this year, many of those homes we also did pre-treat termite work. And that pre-treat termite work comes with a five year warranty, guarantee. So five years from now, we know the homeowner, we know what the exact date that their warranty expires, we\u2019ve been servicing probably 70% of these homes doing their pest control. So who better than to renew their termite work with than HomeTeam? So it\u2019s an interesting phenomena that when housing turns down, you have this five year backlog of customers that will need termite work. So if you look at this past recession, during the housing downturn 2008 through 2011, we were going back to customers so we installed or did pre-treat termite work 2002 to 2006 selling room [ph] termite work. And the HomeTeam grooved through the recession because of the backlog of termite customers needing additional work. Jamie Clement \u2013 Macquarie: Guys, thank you very much as always for your time. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : (Operator instructions) At this time, we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Caller, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Again, your line is open. Please check your mute button. (Operator instructions) And we\u2019ll pause a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. Gary Rollins : We\u2019re on a technical problem with Dan. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Do you hear me now? Harry Cynkus : Yes. Gary Rollins : Yes. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Sorry about that. Quick question for the mid-sector, the nice installation revenue on the residential side and termite. How much of those is really [indiscernible] external market including any sort of execution that Rollins [indiscernible]? Gary Rollins : Well, I\u2019d love to believe it all has to do with execution of Rollins and marketing. Harry Cynkus : Excellent management, Gary. Gary Rollins : Excellent management. But I don\u2019t have any data to \u2013 well, I can say I don\u2019t have any data to support it or suggest otherwise. We know whether it was good in September or was good last year in September, was it better, did that drive it some, we really think some of this as I suggested was people earlier of the year who delayed making decision and gave up waiting. You know I sense just in benchmarking and attending the national industry events as this has somewhat lacked luster. On termite season, they didn\u2019t have swarm. Typically, that\u2019s enjoyed in most areas. I think we\u2019re getting a benefit from our HomeSuite application. We\u2019re in a better position to communicate to the home owner to the kind of work that we do and why do we do we do it and specifically how that relates to their home. So I\u2019d like to get the benefit of anything that\u2019s new, it just takes it a while to get it into your culture and into your routine. So I believe that\u2019s been very helpful for us. And the industry, I mean the season just really felt crazily, I mean as far as the end of the quarter is concerned. But that was more so in pest control than it was in termite. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Got it. That makes sense. And then quickly one follow up on Home. Can you give that number, I think last time, you mentioned positive earnings about 40%. Is there an equivalent number for HomeTeam in quote this time? Gary Rollins : Yes. I don\u2019t have it handy. But the fact that I don\u2019t recall it says it probably was in line with prior \u2013 with what they\u2019ve done all year. Yes, I\u2019m trying to find it here quickly. Yes, it was in line with prior quarters in terms of their improved contribution to the company. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: So it\u2019s contributing \u2013 it\u2019s margin accretive for the company at this time? Gary Rollins : I\u2019m sorry. You broke up a little there. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: It\u2019s margin accretive for the company at this time? Gary Rollins : Are you talking about HomeTeam? Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: The HomeTeam business. Gary Rollins : Yes. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Got it. Gary Rollins : Yes, they continued to improve their margins. Dan Dolev \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Gary. I appreciate it. Operator : (Operator instruction) And I\u2019ll pause another moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. And it appears we have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks at this time. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Well, it\u2019s been an exciting year for the company with again with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. And I think that\u2019s just built through the year as the year progressed. And we really started to see a return on the investments that we had from a technology point of view which was very encouraging. And we really look forward to frankly to the New Year. I know this one\u2019s not over yet, but we\u2019re really very much involved in the plans for 2015. And I look forward as does Harry in speaking with you next time. So thanks for your attendance.

For the quarter revenue grew 5.9% to approximately 344 million compared to almost 325 million in the last year's fourth quarter. Net income increased 7% to approximately 30 million with EPS of $0.21 per diluted share compared to 28 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2013. All of our business lines experienced good growth during the quarter with residential pest control up 5.5%, commercial pest control grew 6.5% and termite grew 7.4%. We\u2019re also pleased to have achieved margin improvement across our U.S. family of brands which include Orkin, HomeTeam, Western Pest Control, IFC, Trutech, Waltham and Crane. Revenues for the full year rose 5.5% over 1.4 billion compared to revenues of approximately 1.3 billion for 2013 and income grew at 11.9% to a 136.7 million compared to net income of a 123.3 million for the same period last year. Our bed bug business ended the year at a record high having grown 18% to nearly 64 million for the full year. Even as national bed bug media attention has lessen this pest continues to be a growing threat wherever people congregate, theaters, hotels, airplanes, schools, hospitals, retirements, apartment complexes, residents and so on. Bed bugs are quite [inaudible]. We believe that this ancillary service will continue to contribute to our growth for some time. We also increased demand for our mosquito service which continues to be an important contributor to our ancillary service segment. As we have discussed in the past, ancillary business is very important to us as it provides us the opportunity to introduce our other residential and commercial pest control services to those home owners and businesses who had not been a customer. I will be remised if I didn\u2019t recognize that what we accomplished in 2014 as a result of the contributions that our 11,000 employees make every day. They are responsible for executing our programs while enabling us to achieve continuous improvement in all that we do. This commitment was reflected in our attaining customer satisfaction, improvement across all brands. As I\u2019ve shared, we track this area by our net promoter scores which once again improved overall. These climbing scores were an indication of the success we\u2019re having in meeting and often exceeding our customers' expectations. It's not enough to just gain new customers but we must work equally hard to have long term relationships with. As I mentioned on our last call, our analytics has identified several opportunities to help improve customer retention. We\u2019re market testing these this year which should help ensure that 2015 will be another year of both improving customer satisfaction as well as retention. Employee retention is equally important to us, one of the most important components of customer loyalty is the relationship that they have with the technician who services their home or business. These men and women are the face of Rollins to our customers. We take this relationship very seriously. Our tech's [ph] continue to benefit from our industry leading training which enables them to perform their service task more efficiently and effectively. 2014 was a positive year for acquisitions as we invested approximately 80 million in cash or stock. Our three largest acquisition were Allpest and Statewide both in Australia and PermaTreat based in Northern Virginia. The outlook for additional acquisitions this year is good as many owners are concerned about the long term impact of Obama Care and the growing importance of one having a strong internet presence which by the way is very difficult for the smaller companies to achieve. Given these factors we believe that a number of companies will be looking to sell their business in the future. To take advantage of this situation we\u2019re increasing our prospecting activities. We\u2019re very successful in 2014 and growing our international franchise network which end of the year stood at 37 having added a record 14 franchises worldwide last year. These new franchises are spread across Latin and South America, the Middle-East, the Caribbean and Asia and all will be benefiting from the world's number one brand in pest control Orkin. We\u2019re confident that we will continue to add to this growing list of locations this year. In fact this month we added India, headquartered in Bangalore as well as three other cities. We\u2019re very aware of the sacrifices of the men and women of the armed services make on our behalf. Last year we have [inaudible] engaged along with others by participating in the Joining Forces Initiative. This initiative is directed to help our returning service people find jobs as they move forward with our civil lives. Facilitating this effort are the Orkin, HomeTeam and western career websites [ph]. Each of these brands has a separate internet page dedicated to recruiting veterans. This medium allows the candidate easy access and applying for jobs within different physician categories including service, sales and management. We\u2019re also supporting reservist and military spouses through our partnerships with employers and Support of Guard and Reserve and the military spouse employment partnership. All of these endeavors benefit our service men and women while improving the makeup of our employee teams. We have a goal to hire over a 1000 of these veterans over the next few years. To-date we\u2019re more than half way there as we have hired and integrated into the company 546 individuals. Let me give you a quick update on HomeTeam, this past year they installed 87,000 tubes in the wall of 5.5% over the previous year and in-line with our expectations. We have established a call center in Raleigh, North Carolina to assist our branches where there are activation objectives. With the economy improving we\u2019re optimistic that both installs and activations by new customers will improve in 2015. Let me wrap up by noting that we\u2019re on target with our plan to roll out our new CRM branch operating system and now have 74 branches on the system. We\u2019re particularly satisfied with how this roll out has gone and the following improvement in productivity and other business metrics. We\u2019re continuing with our next round of roll-outs. For the first quarter we\u2019re targeting 35 locations but like any change of this magnitude we have plenty of work ahead. We enter 2015 as we do each New Year grateful for what we have achieved and excited about our plans for the upcoming year. Rollins is blessed to be in a business that has a never ending supply of opportunities protecting people's health and property as a noble and financially beneficial mission. We remain thankful for our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders all of which have an essential role in what we do and what we achieve. We look forward to sharing our progress with you in the first quarter and I will now turn the call over to Harry. Harry Cynkus : Thank you, Gary. Good day mates and thank you all for joining us on the call. I'm still reminded of your 2014 Australian acquisition that we\u2019re most proud of. One never gets tired of putting another record year in the books and it now makes it to 35th consecutive quarter of improved earnings results. I don\u2019t think Oscar Wilde was thinking of us when he said, consistency is the hallmark of the unimaginative. It's more like what Roger Staubach said, in any team sport the best teams have consistency and chemistry. It's through the combined efforts of all our team members that have pulled together, working together that has allowed us to consistently perform, growing our business and improving profitability. Let's talk about the quarter's performance. Today we reported revenues of 344 million representing 5.9% revenue growth, income before income taxes rose 13% but due to a less favorable income tax rate in 2014 net income increased 7% to 29.9 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared to 28 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. If Congress ever passes corporate tax reform reducing the effective tax rate by closing loop-holes there will be winners and losers, Rollins will be on the winning side of that ledger, there being very few tax breaks that we get to take advantage of. One can only dream. Year-to-date revenues 1.412 billion, a 5.5% increase. Net income for the full year has increased 11.6% another year of growing of net income at 10% or better to a 137.7 million or $0.94 per diluted share with EBITDA coming in at 263 million. I'm sure many of you saw the headlines, 2014 breaks heat record challenging global warming skeptics. I read that and my heart sank. I always thought global warming was going to be good for the pest control business, well, if you want to look at the pretty multi-colored heat map included, much of the U.S. was actually cooler with the exception of the far western U.S. last year with pretty much only the pacific regions experiencing any significant above average temperature. Interestingly that was the area of the country that we saw the best growth in demand, bottom-line global warming should help pest control however not this year. Last quarter we talked about the great September and the positive pest control lead growth trending continuing into October. Well turns out we saw positive growth in demand for both residential and commercial throughout the quarter and continuing right now into January. Fundamentals that drive our revenue leads, pricing closure all remain strong and improved in the quarter. Let's get deeper into the results, this quarter we have seen 5.9% revenue growth among all brands and all service lines. We saw good growth in our commercial pest control business with revenues up 5.9%. Residential pest control was up 5.5%, while our termite service line was up 7.4%, favorably impacted by our recent acquisitions including Allpest, Statewide and PermaTreat. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 2.4% of our overall growth. Our Canadian operation which does around 7% of our company's revenue had good organic growth, however their weakening currency impacted our growth this quarter costing us 6/10ths of 1%. With last week's rate cut by the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar dropped to I think it was another nickel to $0.81, the lowest level in nearly six years. If that continues at that rate it could dent our growth 7/10ths of a percent next year. We love the business in Canada, Orkin, Canada has been a great contributor to our growth and profitability over the years and the stronger U.S. dollar just makes for an even better case to reinvest in Canada. Once we start running against last year's number in Q1, Australia will have some additional drag but it's a much smaller piece of our business today. Let's look at the service lines that make up our business, commercial pest control which makes up 42% of our business was up 5.9%, 6.5% excluding fumigation. We saw strong growth and performance from our national account sales team, a good way to close out the year. Thanks guys and gals. The impact of the currency exchange was reflected almost exclusively in our commercial business as most of Canada's business is commercial. Domestically excluding acquisition and exchange variation, commercial was up 4.8%. Our residential pest control continues to shine growing 5.5% for the quarter representing 41% of our business. The beauty of our business model is recurring revenue. Our business with a strong recurring revenue has been compared to a subscription business that doesn\u2019t have an expiration date. When you add the growth in our customer base last year and continuing in elasticity, it gives us comfort heading into 2015. Gary has already touched on improving customer satisfaction scores which translated into improved retention rates for our commercial business. In fact retention may have been the best ever for the quarter and year overall, but it then translate as well into our residential pest control which was off a tad. In accounting lingo, a tad is not much. But it didn\u2019t improve so we\u2019re not satisfied. Actually we\u2019re little puzzled by it and breaking it down by the short, mid and long term customers to gain some insights and make sure we\u2019re taking the right steps to see it improve next year. Our terminate and ancillary services grew 7.4% and represents almost 17% of revenue, the 7.4% was certainly helped by the acquisitions, the fourth quarter is never a big selling season for termite but we grew a respectable 2.4% excluding the acquisitions. Fortunately improved closure and pricing continued to result in great sales dollars despite the decrease in demand that we experienced. Gary has already given you the numbers on bed bugs but I would like to point out to those who might have missed Orkin's press release earlier this month, we announced that Chicago heads our top 50 bed bug cities list for the third year in a row. I'm not sure what it is with Ohio but four out of the Top 10 cities are in Ohio. Do a lot of people from Ohio spend time in Chicago? Anyways many of you this on call are in New York City and you may take solace in knowing New York city fell one place to 18th. Gross margins for the quarter increased to 49.1% versus 48.5% in the prior year's fourth quarter due primarily to favorable healthcare cost and casually claim development while maintaining good cost controls across most spending categories. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased 1.4 million totaling 11.3 million, depreciation was 5.3 million, the larger piece of the depreciation amortization, continues to be the amortization of acquired customer contracts totaling $6 million for the quarter, 26.9 million for the full year. This represents a significant after tax charge of $0.12 this year. When we do pest control acquisitions, there is seldom any significant hard assets on the balance sheets and as a result most of the valuation ends up being classified as customer contracts, intangibles and other intangible assets. We currently carry a 133.5 million of such from acquisitions on our balance sheet. With additional acquisitions ongoing in the future and current amortization running approximately 27 million a year we will have more than a few more years of this expense flowing through the P&L. We see little risk and possible impairment charges. All of the businesses we have acquired have grown as we continue to write-down the value of the customer contracts recognized at the time of the acquisition while fully expensing the cost of any new customer acquisitions. While we\u2019re on the subject of non-cash charges running through our P&L we have nearly $11 million this year in stock based compensation which represents a $0.05 of charged to earnings as well. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased 4.9 million or 4.6% to 32.4% revenues decreasing from 32.8% for the fourth quarter ended December 31. The decrease in margin percent is due to reductions made in administrative salaries, reflecting realignment of some of our operations and cost containment programs. These were initiated at the corporate office [ph] late last year as well as some additional expense reduction related to last year's advertising test which did not reoccur this year. We didn\u2019t catch as many breaks in our provision for income taxes as we did last year when we enjoyed a 32.1% rate in the fourth quarter. This year we came in at a 35.7% for the quarter, 37.4% for the full year and we expect it to run around 37.7% for next year barring any other congressional actions which I won't comment further on. As consistent as we perform each quarter and every year has it's own set of challenges and opportunities. This quarter was no exception. One challenge was having to overcome the impact from the implementation of our CRM branch operating system. As Gary has already pointed out we were very pleasantly surprised that in the initial branches where it has been implemented we have seen negligible negative impact and in some branches we actually saw positive results in the first month of implementation. Keep in mind that convergence of this magnitude don\u2019t happen without additional out of pocket initial cost to our normal operating cost. In this quarter we had to deal with higher implementation cost primarily trainers and travel along with the related depreciation expense for the first time. Combined the cost is approximately $2.5 million one full cent and a 1.7 million increase over last year's run-rate. I pointed out this quarter as these items will continue to impact us significantly next year as well. We\u2019re investing in the future of Rollins and all of it's pest control branch. As a situation we benefited from on the other was the lower fuel prices at the end of the quarter helping us to the tune of approximately $500,000. Please note we experience a one month lag on each month's actual gas usage due to normal delays in receiving the bill and processing time. November's usage was recorded in December and in January we will see December's charges. Approximately 80% of the savings is reflected in CSP with 20% in SG&A. Let's talk briefly about 2015, next year, fuel is an obvious opportunity as we will continue to benefit from the 650,000 to 800,000 plus gallons of fuel purchased each month, so oil prices rebound. We don\u2019t hedge so we will see the changes in fuel prices pretty much the following month which is nice when prices are falling and you\u2019ve no expense of hedges to write-off. But there are always challenges and we will have to deal with the impact of exchange rates which we have already discussed, healthcare, how much medical inflation will we see next year. The largest challenge, that will be the implementation and roll out of our [inaudible] and branch operating system. As CFO, I must ask will it continue to perform as it has? Will there be performance or system issues as the number of branches that are online continue to expand? Have we incorporated all of the subtle differences that may exist in different parts of the country? Let's not forget the additional cost with a full roll out as we press ahead. We estimate cost could approach $12 million in 2015 increasing $6 million over this year. Gary says I worry too much and spend nap time working to make it happen. We\u2019ve a history of investing and improving our business and this will be no different. Our guidance for next year which shouldn\u2019t come out as a surprise, financially we can do better and we\u2019re planning on it. As in the past we continue to build on our solid foundation, possessing a strong balance sheet and cash flows. Rollins continues to be financial strong, EBITDA reached almost 265 million, net cash provided by operating activities grew nearly 20% to 195 million this year. With our strong cash flow we continue to reinvest in the business. The number one priority for our cash continues to be investing in what we know best, pest control and only pest control. We funded our $28 million in capital expenditures and invested $63 million of our cash in acquisitions this year. With cash to spare we returned to $110 million to our shareholders through both our stock buyback and dividend programs. We bought just over 1 million shares of our common stock and our authorization purchase of an additional 3.9 million shares. For the third consecutive year the Board declared a special dividend paid in the fourth quarter, this year $0.10 per share totaling $14 million. We began the year with a $118 million in the bank and no debt and ended the year after all of our investments with a 108 million in no debt. Needless to say we feel good about our financial condition as well as our future. Last night we announced that the Board of Directors has approved a 3 for 2 stock split of the company's common shares. The split will be affected by issuing one additional share of common stock for every two shares of common stock held. The additional shares will be distributed on March 10, 2015 to stock orders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2015. In addition, the company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share on March 10, 2015 to shareholders of record at close of business February 10, 2015. The cash dividend will be paid on the pre-split shares and represents a 14.3% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. This marks the 13th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% or greater. Two weeks ago we had our annual leadership meeting with almost a 150 of our top managers from all our operating companies. It's an amazing group of extraordinarily talented people and everyone was enthusiastic and very positive about the plans we have for 2015. Our team is focused and see some wonderful opportunities we have before us. Lastly let me express our appreciation for a job well done to all of the Rollins associates whose hardwork and dedication are behind these outstanding results. With that I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. I will now open up our call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : I know just gaining [ph] at one of the service suite roll-out but is there anything that you guys can share with us kind of early on in terms of productivity gains or maybe even what some of your branches are saying about what they like most about the system, or what they like least about the system? Harry Cynkus : In terms of what they like I think most about the system and we get great reviews and people sending, when am I going to get it? Is that the technicians have iPhones as supposed to heavy bulky handheld computers with a secondary phone and what not. So the iPhone has been a huge hit, I would rather carry an iPhone, I don\u2019t know what was it 3-4 pound handheld. So, that clearly for the technicians -- lately [ph] it's a big win. You know the administrative people in the office. I'm surprised that they have seem to miss or don\u2019t miss those green streams, you know the Cayman two tone green and they seem to be adapting real well to the multi-color window based screens that we\u2019re now dealing with. Gary Rollins : They also like the flexibility, it's lot easier to move a customer to change their service time which is necessary because the customers are not always there on their pre-determined service stage, so they can move around and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort to do that. I think the thing is just a lot quicker, they don\u2019t have to wait so long for the screen changes. We have really gotten grades from the very beginning even when -- there were many features that wouldn\u2019t work exactly well. So the field has been very positive as far as this conversion is concerned. Productivity wise it's just too soon to tell, as Harry said we have got some branches that have improved immediately and I think those have the later branches. We learned something through these conversions, the best way to do it, the best way to do the training, the best way to do the pre-preparation. But we\u2019re optimistic about improving the number of accounts that we can service each day. Harry Cynkus : Though I do want to point out while we have seen productivity gains in some of the branches they are modest coming out of the box and there is a lot of best practices and we have talked about having, besides having an implementation team whether we don\u2019t follow and we don\u2019t know what's the best timeframe but to have productivity teams follow up and come back and share best practice and what not. We\u2019re in the real early -- you know one thing we see, we see productivity gains with the technicians, administrative office, we\u2019re seeing higher overtime in the first month or two. We\u2019re seeing some drop-off in AR Collection so we\u2019re seeing some degradation in the AR region. Gary Rollins : And that\u2019s the reason frankly because we\u2019re working on the conversion. So there are time, application changes and one of the things that we\u2019re also looking at is we have a special collection team that supports that branch for the first two days -- excuse me two months. So we don\u2019t have that kind of deterioration. Harry Cynkus : I think the biggest thing we\u2019re surprised about is going into this we\u2019re expecting to see some degradation for 2-3 months before a branch snap back and then started seeing gains and we are just not seeing the losses over the -- the problem is coming out of the gate. My biggest concern continues to do it, as I think I\u2019ve listed, talked about on the call, as you add more and more branches to the system what's that do, have we figured out how to keep the response time timely. Have we figured it out all the little wrinkles that we will see going to different parts of the country, but so far so good job. Joe Box : Harry, earlier you talked about $12 million spend on the roll-out in '15 which I think was an incremental 6 million year-over-year. Should we think about that as being a level load at 3 million per quarter or is there going to be a unique cadence with that spend? Harry Cynkus : No I think at this point is level, because we\u2019re limited by the number of trainers we have as to how many branches we can do in a given month and quarter. So, we have loaded and trained and brought people to the level where we think we\u2019re going to be at a level throughout the year, I don\u2019t think, unless we find some metric into the third quarter where you know this is going so smooth and if we double the implementers we can double the number of branches being implemented and speed up the getting across all of them. But right now the plan is to go at a pretty steady and it's probably going to average 10 plus branches a month, some months more. We have identified some months to have a break in the schedule to catch our breath and if we have to make some adjustments, there are some changes, you know it's built into the schedule. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev : So question on the residential business, your compares were somewhat easier in the fourth quarter for the residential, I think about 150 basis points and yet if my numbers are correct, the acceleration ex-M&A is only about 10 basis points. Now I think you mentioned you were in that 100%, was that -- can you be a little bit more specific on what you think happened and is there any reason to believe that the implementation of the CRM system had anything to do with that at least on a short term basis. Thank you. Harry Cynkus : No the CRM, we don\u2019t see it -- that\u2019s a good thing we go back and look at see if our starts I don\u2019t think -- I think I'm missed tracking that numbers, starts in the branches undergoing implementation whether we -- but there is just not enough of them to that should overall impact that. I mean the fourth quarter is always a tough quarter to predict. So October was a great month, and then leads dropped off in November and it's okay we need to hunt it down and turn around and December picked up. So it's certainly gets real variable, January looks like it was doing real well and then the Mid-West in New England area got hit with the little snow which I'm sure slowest down here in January. Of course a year ago, Gary and I were both sitting at home today doing this conference call, we got snowed out here in Atlanta. So there is really nothing I can really specifically point at. I think overall we\u2019re happy with seeing the leads through the first six months of the year, we were seeing decreases, picked up in the third quarter and it continued growing here in the fourth quarter. So, you need the leads to grow the business and overall we feel good about it. Dan Dolev : And then two more questions, one on HomeTeam size, see this correctly, there has been an acceleration in the installs in Q4. Can you maybe-- Harry Cynkus : Yes, I think they were up 5% in Q4 where they have been up 4% in Q3. So homebuilders, the pace drops down considerably in the Q4, and they tend not to start too many homes late in the year and carry inventory across. The sentiments are strong, we are modeling that, we think and our markets will see another possibly 4%, 5%, increase installs next year over this year. Gary Rollins : We have very good profit improvement at HomeTeam as a result of a reorganization that we initiated mid-year. So we will get some of that this first half but I think HomeTeam had a good year. Dan Dolev : And last question if I may ask, what is the rationale for this stock split? Why now? Gary Rollins : Sure. Rollins has had a long history of stock split and I think it's really driven by liquidity, having more shares available to trade in the market. Every time we split the shares we see the volume trade and make it easier for people to get in or get out of the market, we\u2019re feeling good about our business and like I said this is I think the fourth split in 15 years. Dan Dolev : It seems to be working. Gary Rollins : Yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Just one follow-up for you Gary, in the release that came out this morning, you alluded to some strategic initiatives that you think could help with 2015 numbers. I'm just curious if there is anything that\u2019s new or different that maybe you could share with us. Gary Rollins : I don\u2019t think that there is anything new so much as we really kind of learned a lot with our home suite and business suite last year and our EDS, our sales management system and we have kind of worked out some of the I guess bumps in a road that we had there. So we really are optimistic that we\u2019re going to get a lot bigger lift and then from a marketing point of view, we have got things that we really can't talk about but we plan to make some changes there. The analytics team I guess is relatively new for us. I think that was mid-year and they have come up with some very interesting plans and programs that we intend to test. So some of our stuff is kind of secret that we can't talk about it at this particular juncture but as always I think that\u2019s one of the traits of the company. I think that we have, every year we have programs that we feel will be very important to help us maintain our growth and our profitability. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen with no further questions in queue I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Well this has been an exciting year for our company. We benefited from a great deal of enthusiasm and energy. We have maintained that enthusiasm going into this New Year. We have great teams across all areas of our business who are focused on our goal to always get better and be better and I appreciate you joining us today. We look forward to visiting with you again in 2015. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen we do appreciate your participation in today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. Once again we do appreciate your participation. Have a great rest of your day. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. Before I delve into our first quarter results, I wanted to take a moment and thank Harry for his 17 years of service to Rollins as our CFO. As most of you know, he will be retiring from our company on May 1. Harry\u2019s leadership, talent, and dedication played a major role in the growth and success of Rollins. We will miss him greatly and wish him and his family all the best in retirement. Be assured, however, I am not going to let him stray too far. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Eddie Northen to our company. We are extremely pleased to have him join Rollins as our new CFO. Eddie comes to us from UPS and brings, not only a wealth of financial experience, strong international exposure, but also a great background in routing and supply-chain management. These areas are extremely important to us as we continue to grow our company. Eddie, please tell everyone a little bit more about yourself. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. I want to also thank Harry for his leadership and support during my transition period. Filling Harry\u2019s shoes will be quite the task, but the transition period that Gary has allowed and Harry has taken with me definitely has me ready to take the next step. I had the opportunity to spend time with a number of Rollins team members in Atlanta and in the field, as well as meet with numerous investors. This exposure has made me feel even more privileged to be a part of this exceptional company. During my 30 years at UPS, I was extremely fortunate to gain invaluable operational and finance experience. Early in my career, I worked on the frontline and drove a package car. This time enabled me to learn the business from the ground up and help me to prepare me for the future opportunities in front of me. After spending time in internal audit and several director of finance roles around the U.S., our family moved to Hong Kong in 2006 where I was the CFO of Asia-Pacific region. A few years later, I returned back to the States, where I held a similar role as Vice President of Finance of the West region. Most recently, I was Vice President of Finance of the Global Business Service Group based here in Atlanta. I believe the fact that UPS and Rollins are both route based businesses with very similar cultures will help me with the transition into my new job and enable me to focus as Harry has on the long-term financial strength of Rollins. I will now turn the call back to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. While winter continued its roll through part of the quarter, particularly in the Northeast, however, this year for much of the quarter we were blessed with warmer weather in most other parts of the country. New customer demand increase coupled with our strong recurring revenue resulted in our generating both record revenue and profit for the quarter. Revenues grew 5.6% to approximately $331 million, compared to $313 million in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Net income increased 17.5% to over $30 million with EPS of $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $25.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. All of our business lines experienced good growth with residential pest control up 6.2%, commercial pest control grew 4.2%, and termite was up 8% for the quarter. Harry will provide greater detail on the contributions from acquisitions and the negative currency impact as well. Leads, lead closure, and prices were all up. Momentum in leads that we saw last year carried through the first quarter and finished especially strong in March. Typically, a strong March is followed by a weak April. At this point, we are seeing a contradiction and we could enjoy a strong March and April. As many of you might recall, during the first quarter of each year, we conduct test to determine where customer pricing opportunities exists. This year\u2019s testing again shows that our service rates remain inelastic. We believe that this is the result of our strong brand preference and the delivery of value that we provide to our residential and commercial customers. This past quarter, we executed on some strategic initiatives to help ensure our ongoing growth in profitability. Let me highlight just a few of these initiatives. Employee training has been and will continue to be extremely important to our company. To that end, we recently hired a new Director of Training, John Torres, to help us further advance Rollins\u2019 award-winning training programs. By way of background, John brings over 25 years of experience in creating and implementing learning initiatives that drive positive business results. Almost every company does train, but many don\u2019t measure the effectiveness of the training. And one of John\u2019s objectives is to help us improve the tracking and measuring of our training results. We believe that this will lead to better outcomes and help to ensure that we remain a national leader with our training programs. Another training initiative is a new hands-on training that our call center agents are receiving at the Rollins training center here in Atlanta where they experience training in our model home. The company\u2019s sales and service agent teams nearly doubled in the busy part of the pest control season to meet the seasonal business demand. We want to ensure that these new employees are well trained and are able to address our prospects, questions, and requirements. They spend the day at the center where the agents can see firsthand how technicians interact with new customers and observe the treatments that they provide during a pest control initial start, that\u2019s the customers first service. When they leave, their ability to paint a picture for our prospects of what a technician does provides confidence and builds value in our services. As many of you are aware, we host a leadership meeting in January of each year with our top management that comes from all over North America. During this meeting, we explain and set the stage for our key programs and initiatives for the year. This year\u2019s main theme was focused on hiring the right people. Every manager in our company recognizes first and foremost that our business is a people\u2019s business and it requires great employees to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. As the customers\u2019 needs and anticipations continue to increase, it is more important now than ever that we have the right person in the right job. We\u2019ve concluded that it\u2019s not the what, but the who that matters; and one of things that we\u2019re doing in refining our recruiting and interview methodology. We are improving our processes to better identify and hire the right people. Our training in this area is really catching all throughout the company and is being driven down into the different brands and divisions. As Rollins President and COO, John Wilson put it, if we do a great job in selecting the who, the what would be much easier.  We are continuing to successfully rollout our CRM system or what we refer to as BOSS; branch operations support system and we now have a 118 Orkin branches converted. It\u2019s important to note that even as we bring additional Orkin branches online, we\u2019re also taking steps to make technology improvements to other brands in order to improve their customer service and profitability. One such example is at TruTech where they are now in the process of having a technician use tablets for all their work order processing. Additionally, they are able to handle checks and credit card payments on their tablets.  In March, we turned on the switch in the converted branches for the BOSS automated work order processing feature. We\u2019re currently in test and the results thus far are very promising. In the old system, the technician at the end of the day would bring his or her work tickets back to the branch where they had to be keyed into the system and reviewed by an Ad man. Depending on the volume this process could take days. What we discovered with our new automation was that less than 1% of the work orders actually needed human intervention. In test, the average processing time for new work order completion on the iPhone can be done in 18.5 minutes, versus the manual paper handling that could take two days to get service posted to a customer\u2019s account. We now freed up approximately two hours of an Ad man\u2019s time each day, which allows him or her to take on additional value-added projects such as collections and customer schedule. We have other initiatives centered around BOSS, which we are working on and Eddie and I will provide you further updates as they roll out. These initiatives include further improvement of our routing capabilities and a management dash board, which will allow the service manager to track the progress of technicians throughout the day. I think this gives you a snap shot of several improvements that are provided by BOSS. This is a work in progress and going forward we will continue to add more platforms and routines. Like most computer systems it doesn\u2019t all come day one. BOSS would help us improve our productivity, our margins and most important our customer experience. Growing our business through acquisitions is also an ongoing company goal. We recently enhanced our wildlife line of business with the acquisition of credit control that franchisor of the nation\u2019s leading wild life control company. This has indirectly made us the largest wild life control company in the country. For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with this business, these services include trapping and removal of wild life, exclusion of wild life from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wild life. Top test includes squirrels, raccoons, bats, birds, and snakes. The market in the U.S. for residential and commercial wild life control is approximately $300 million and we believe that there is a tremendous opportunity to grow this business and capitalize on the industry\u2019s leading brand. We are off to a good start for the year and excited about all the opportunities that we have to continue the growth in improvement of our company. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Harry. Harry Cynkus : Thank you Gary for those kind words. It\u2019s hard to believe that 17 years have gone by since I joined Rollins. I\u2019ve been thinking about that next chapter in my life for some time. I was told that long time ago that the best time to start thinking about your retirement is before the boss does. Anyways, I\u2019m reminded of the Vince Lombardi quote, \u201cThe harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.\u201d And believe me it\u2019s hard to leave such a great company with such great people. However, I am confident that I am leaving it in good hands with the future as bright as ever. Let\u2019s get to the numbers, I\u2019m sure no one dialed in today to hear me wax poetic and in fact I hope everyone has forgotten that one call with my poetry. Eddie, I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying poetry here.  Looking at the numbers, the company reported first quarter revenues of $330.9 million, an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's first quarter\u2019s revenue of $313.4 million. We experienced that growth across all of our family of brands as measured in constant currency. We will talk more about that in a minute.  Net income increased an impressive 17.5% to $30.3 million, compared to $25.8 million with EPS, up 16.7% to $0.14 versus $0.12 per diluted share last year in the first quarter, a good start to the New Year. Having grown up in the Northeast I\u2019ve had to learn to speak a little more slowly, as I\u2019ve migrated down South. And then when it comes to explaining our revenue between the impact of currency, acquisitions and with and without fumigation it\u2019s important to go slowly. On the surface, revenue is up 5.6%, good growth among all brands and all service lines. Residential pest control is up 6.2%, commercial pest control up 4.2% and termite up 8%. With operations in Canada and Australia, the strong dollar was not our friend. With the loonie down nearly 12% from last year and the Australian dollar down more 14% in total it caused us nearly nine-tenths of a percent i.e. 90 basis points on growth. On the other hand, the more significant acquisitions we made over the last year AllPest that we lapped in mid-February, Statewide, PermaTreat and our most recent acquisition Critter Control contributed 1.9%. Put that all together and it means our business, excluding currency, excluding acquisition, grew 4.6% versus 4.2% in Q4. Residential pest control business, which represents 40% of our revenue continues to build momentum. For the quarter, it grew 6.2%, ex-acquisition 5.2%, termite which makes up 17% was up 8%, excluding acquisition 4.8%; and commercial pest control 42% of the revenue was up 4.2%, excluding acquisition 2.5%. We\u2019re pleased with the growth we are showing for residential pest control and termite. Commercial was heavily impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollar as most of our business in these countries is commercial. If you just look at our domestic commercial business, excluding acquisitions it grew 4.4%, which does include a 40 basis point lift from fumigation. Fumigation had its best growth quarter in sometime, up 12.9%. As we have previously stressed, it is especially important for us to add recurring residential pest control customers to our customer base. Be it good fortune, better weather or just great marketing, we saw strong lead growth, improved closure percent and average price, which enabled Orkin to achieve significant growth in sales in a quarter not always known for its robustness. Last year, we reported that we have nearly 4000 less calls in the first quarter. This year calls were up 20,000 and it\u2019s encouraging to see the trends continue into April. Residential pest control isn\u2019t quite like other consumer businesses. I read the other week in The Wall Street Journal that retailer sales rose in March, but U.S. consumer showed signs of continued caution. Well thankfully not when it comes to buying pest control. I love repeating Gary\u2019s quote that rats and roaches don\u2019t read The Wall Street Journal.  With insects being the public\u2019s third greatest fear and the ever increasing concern over health and safety, the phone has been ringing. We can see the same degree of strong consumer response when it came to termite with a modest increase in leads, some price improvement realization, we had a respectable first quarter growth. HomeTeam\u2019s increase in new home pretreat certainly was a good help. Speaking of HomeTeam, they came out of the gate fast this year and as I said before we\u2019re trying to figure out HomeTeam, don\u2019t waste a lot of time looking at the national statistics on new home starts or sales, as the national picture doesn\u2019t represent well the 50 markets they are in or the tail of installs versus turnouts. Their tax build in pest control defense systems installed in new homes was up 7.5% for the quarter, termite pretreat work was up 8.1% and we saw the largest month over previous month increase in sometime for new customer capture, customers activating systems that were installed when the house was under construction. When it comes to revenue, the last thing worth mentioning is bed box. The first quarter is not typically the big quarter for growth in this service. The last couple of years it has been only 15% to 16%. However, this year, we saw the largest first quarter dollar growth since we\u2019ve been tracking it the year-to-year changes in 2011, up over 25% increase to $14.6 million. Sadly for our listeners, the residential bed bug business grew 33%. Unfortunately, bed bugs are good hitchhikers and people are taking them home with them when they travel. As I said before, bed bugs do not make good tats. One of the shareholders gave me a good lead on some reading material now that I\u2019ll have more time. It\u2019s the number one Amazon best seller in the entomology category, it\u2019s called Infested by Brooke Borel and I\u2019ve read that it\u2019s a fun wild rock through the wildly world of bed bugs. I don\u2019t want to give too much of the book away, but I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s a real page turner. Gross margin for the quarter improved to 49.2% for the first quarter versus 48.5% in the prior year. The quarter benefitted from improved service, administrative salaries with lower fleet cost due to the drop in fuel while maintaining good cost controls across most spending categories. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter increased 567,000 totaling 10.8 million, depreciation was 4.6 million, increasing 1.2 million, a million of the increase related to our new Boss system. Amortization of intangibles was 6.2 million, which decreased nearly 700,000 as some of the older, eight to 10 years older acquisitions have become fully amortized. For the full year, amortization of intangibles typically from the value assigned to acquired customer contracts will represent a significant after tax non-cash charge of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 this year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased 4.7 million or 4.7% to 31.9% of revenues decreasing from 32.1% from the first quarter last year. The decrease in margin percent is due to being able to leverage our administrative salaries and other cost keeping them relatively flat to last year despite the increase in revenues. The margin improvement was partially offset by the $1.2 million in this year\u2019s higher cost related to the CRM system implementation as well as higher sales salaries and professional fees related to procurement and acquisitions. Income before income taxes was up 12.7% in the quarter. We caught a break on the tax rate this quarter which could drop to 35% having identified some discrete items which unfortunately won\u2019t repeat. We expect the tax rate to return to potentially 38% next quarter. As a result, our net income was up 17.5% for the first quarter. I think that qualifies as Gary said, a good start to the New Year. Our balance sheet remained strong, no surprise there. We continue to look for more opportunities to reinvest in our business. This quarter, we spent nearly $30 million on acquisitions and $8 million on CapEx. To our bankers [indiscernible] we won\u2019t run out of cash any time soon ending the quarter with $93 million in cash and no debt.  One interesting facet of the business that I enjoy pointing out is that we continue to have more customers prepay us for services over $100 million recognized currently on our balance sheet as unknown revenue than those who all was for current services 85.4 million in trade and finance receivables which we believe the new Boss system will help us reduce. What a great business model we have? Before I turn the call back to Gary, let me express our appreciation and thank you to all our associates and others whose hard work and dedication is getting us off to a good start in 2015. It is with bittersweet emotions that I leave to begin my retirement. I am excited about what the future offers and enjoying the rewards of a very long career, but I am sad to say good-bye to so many great people I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with here at Rollins. It is through their combined efforts that Rollin is great and I will miss them all. Likewise, I will miss the people that I\u2019ve gotten to know in the investment community. Thanks for all you do and the positive impact you\u2019ve had on me and my career.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to you, Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Harry. We are now ready to open the call for any questions that you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dan Dolev at Jefferies. Dan Dolev : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I actually have two question, actually one for Eddie and then I have a question on the operational side. So, my question for Eddie is, you\u2019ve been with the company now for a few months, you\u2019ve travelled around both internal Rollins branches and you\u2019ve been, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen every aspect of the company. What are the things that you\u2019ve seen that you think \u2013 where do you see the most opportunity actually improving going forward from what you\u2019ve seen thus far? Eddie Northen : Yeah, Dan. Thanks. You mentioned having time to spend learning different parts of the business. Gary has been very supportive with allowing me to spend about a month in the operations \u2013 learning the different operations. And I think what I\u2019ve tried to do from that perspective is kind of take what I brought with me from UPS and really kind of look at it through those lens. As I was visiting the operations, one of the things that I saw was really the depth of the management that we have there and how strong they are from a P&L perspective, and I think that\u2019s something that we can really continue to use as we move forward. I think that routing and scheduling continues to be an opportunity for us and Gary mentioned that when he was talking about the Boss. So I think that we\u2019re going to be able to kind of bring those two pieces together and in fact I have some follow-up meetings with the operations over the coming months and that\u2019s really where I want to try to spend some time and energy there is to see what and how we might be able to help from that perspective. Dan Dolev : Got it. Thank you very much. And my other question was in the operational side for you or Harry or Gary. You mentioned Gary that the first \u2013 that you had warmer weather, April was good, March was good and clearly you\u2019ve had - the weather hadn\u2019t been that big of an impact, but if I think about sort of the organic growth acceleration ex-M&A, ex-FX of 4.6 versus 4.2 in Q4. I can\u2019t tell, but I think it\u2019s not as impressive as I would have wanted it to be given that the compares \u2013 organic compares are so much easier. So was there \u2013 is there something that I\u2019m missing or is this just a start of an accelerating year? How should we think about that? Thanks. Gary Rollins : Well, while the weather wasn\u2019t as difficult, I would point out it doesn\u2019t matter how \u2013 unless you have record highs in January and February, you are just not adding a lot of customers during that timeframe. So while \u2013 I think we are more impressed than you are that we did grow in the first quarter. And like I said, it\u2019s really the strong March that gets it going. But we will get as many leads in June as we get in probably January, February, March, combined. So, again, it\u2019s just \u2013 you have a big base of customers and trying to get that number accelerated takes a lot of new customers. And I think the exciting number was there were 24,000 more calls this year than last year. Now, all those calls don\u2019t turn into customers, but it gives you a good shot at them. Dan Dolev : Got it. Okay. Well, thank you very much and, again, congrats to Eddie and a lot of warm regards to Harry as well in your retirement. Thank you. Harry Cynkus : Thanks, Dan. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from Joan Tong at Sidoti. Joan Tong : Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Gary Rollins : Good, wonderful. Harry Cynkus : Good. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Good. How are you Joan? Joan Tong : Good, good. I have a couple of questions here. First off, regarding the new CRM system. Thanks for all the color in terms of all the new features that\u2019s supposed to come on in the future, it\u2019s really good to hear that. There is more specific that we can talk about and discuss going forward. And I understand that like you know all these stuff is good, but in terms of how you can incentivize people to use the features and use all these good stuff in the new CRM system, can you just talk about like how you are going to do that and approach that in terms of making sure your technicians, your managers, are all using the CRM system in the right way? Gary Rollins : I think simply that it makes our job easier. I mean we\u2019ve had new programs and processes in the past where we really did have to spend a lot of time following up and making sure that they were being utilized. But in this case, the branches love the system. And although, we don\u2019t have our routing and scheduling put in, but even beyond that it\u2019s just a lot more flexible, it\u2019s just a better operating system. So I think that we are blessed that they\u2019re going to \u2013 they are going to enjoy, the ones that are on it, enjoy it. Never had we had even when the thing was very immature did we ever have a branch that says please take this thing out and just give me what I used to have. So they are very positive. And Eddie, you might share what you saw on your [indiscernible]? Eddie Northen : Yeah, Joan, when I was out for the month, I rode with probably more than a dozen technicians during the time and I have to tell you that ones that we are on the Boss system, they were excited to share with me what the capabilities were. I mean making it easier for their interface with the customer, making it easier for them to schedule what it is that they are going to do for their customer if they need to make changes or adjustments. And I don\u2019t really know a lot about the former system, but for technicians as they are trying to teach me about the business and this was something that they wanted to share with me, to me that tells me that they were adopting it very well. Joan Tong : Very good. Harry Cynkus : Yeah, and I just want to say, I think you are going to find like on any curve, you\u2019re going to see 20% of the people taking to it being your power users and we\u2019ve identified the bottom 20% who are struggling and in fact what we\u2019re doing is in the way, when I say struggling, it could be a misnomer. But what we do is we are measuring the number of calls to the helpline for people who are having problems and call the helpline. So the branches that are calling more frequently, i.e. have left more questions about it, we are sending some of the trainers back to those branches to help them overcome the pieces they don\u2019t know. So, part of it is going to be continued training. And we can measure and that\u2019s one of the things we are doing is if they don\u2019t understand, they are calling. And so, we know who we need to go out and help. And then, I think, ultimately, we will find ways to disseminate what the power users are doing and whether we use the trainers to take that to the other branches, best practice. As both Gary and Eddie have said, there is tremendous excitement in the field. It\u2019s making their job easier. They have a cool iPhone and they are more than happy to get rid of what I started referring to as our turn-of-the-century old CRM system. Joan Tong : That\u2019s very good. Thank you for the update. And then on the international side, you guys seem like, I just want to get an update on your view in terms of expanding internationally, is Australia still going to be an area that you\u2019re going to focus on because I believe in the past you mentioned that area can be a State, if not bigger than your Canadian division and also maybe Eddie talk about your, how your international experience would help Rollins maybe over the longer term to maybe even accelerate the international expansion strategy there? Gary Rollins : Yeah we continue to be excited by Australia; I think we realize to be successful there. We have to follow the same model that we did in Canada and that\u2019s to be in all major cities. We\u2019re not there yet today, we continue to explore opportunities there, but we\u2019re patient. We will find the right companies with the right culture and we will build out right network continue in Australia. Eddie Northen : Yeah, Joan. I\u2019ve had a chance to spend some time with Tom who is in charge of our international operation in fact I\u2019m going to be attending the international franchise maybe that they have their annual meeting. So, I\u2019m going to get a chance to learn about where we are right now, what is working for us right now and then also talk about that as we\u2019re moving forward in time. So, I\u2019m really kind of going through the learning curve of that, but Tom and I had some good conversations, but I think that right now the focus is in the areas where we know we have opportunities and of course that being Australia\u2019s as we\u2019ve already talked about. Joan Tong : Okay. Thank you very much. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Joe Box at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Egan : Hey good morning everyone. This is Sean Egan on for Joe Box. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Sean Egan : Good morning. I was hoping to dig in a little bit to the gross margin expansion and I was hoping you could maybe either quantify or place an order of magnitude kind of what that fuel savings benefit was and within that fuel savings benefit what was attributed to fuel price declines versus any route optimisation efficiencies that you had? Gary Rollins : I wish I could answer that question there, I could measure my route operation efficiencies that closely. In fact I know I drove more miles this first quarter, but I have lot more customers than I had last year this time and so I can\u2019t break it down that finally. I don\u2019t know approximately that fuel savings which isn\u2019t all CSP, some of it is reflected in SG&A rents, I think it was like around $2.3 million that\u2019s what we estimate the savings in fuel was and pretty much offsetting that was the increased cost due to the BOSS implementation and depreciation, which came in about $2.2 million. So, those two pretty much offset each other in the Q1. Sean Egan : Okay great and then carrying on with the depreciation comment you made, I guess we kind of expected it to be higher than it came given the CRM implementation, so should we expect a similar level that we saw this quarter heading forward or do you expect that to bump up as you continue to rollout this system? Gary Rollins : We certainly haven\u2019t finished spending money on the CRM system, so it will be some additional, but I think it will be a slow creep as supposed to large bump at this point. Sean Egan : Okay. Got you, thank you. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Sean Egan : And then can you just talk about a little bit as to what you think is driving that increased momentum in the residential line, is it simply a function of better tools for the technicians to close leads, any color there on what\u2019s driving that? Gary Rollins : Training, we spend a lot of time on closure, just a little bit about what we are doing to pair for the surge in our call center, so we really think that we\u2019ve got some more upside as far as closure is concerned. Our marketing people say it\u2019s all them, but I\u2019m not buying that. I think it\u2019s just a combination of things, I mean our service sales are up, which is important. We are just kind of attacking the thing from various points and so far it\u2019s starting to pay off for us. Sean Egan : And finally, last item here on the commercial line of business domestically, can you comment on any potential weather impacts that you saw during the period and any kind of ramp through the quarter? Gary Rollins : Product commercial business would be the least impacted by weather. if you are restaurants, your doors are open and the pest control company is visiting you, so I wouldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think weather really had any impact on the commercial business, it certainly would impact the termite, it\u2019s kind of hard to \u2013 your termites aren\u2019t going to swarm under 3 feet of snow and pest control you are waiting for the weather to get warmer. While in general the weather was better overall, but the northeast was \u2013 I was up in Washington D.C. this weekend and see it went down to 38 degrees one night, wondering when spring was come in. So some possible exactly to measure weather and I think I\u2019ve said a number of items, it really affects us on the fringe of the business. Once you\u2019re going to get warm in the spring and once it get cold in the winter and then in between its case of our \u2013 us executing our business plans. Sean Egan : Alright, great. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks guys. Harry Cynkus : Thank you. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take the next question from Jamie Clement at Macquarie. Jamie Clement : Good morning, gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Harry Cynkus : Good morning, Jamie. Jamie Clement : I was wondering, Harry, I think or Gary, I\u2019m not sure with one of you used in your prepared remarks. You had some numbers around folks who turned on the tax systems and the numbers added pretty strong. So I was wondering if you could give those again and also can you give a little bit of color in terms of what your impression is as to why you saw the increase? Is this the way you marketed to them? Is this just sort of natural timing based on what you\u2019ve seen over the last four or six quarters or so? I am just curious for your thoughts. Harry Cynkus : Yeah. The tax new customers were up nearly \u2013 it was up 6% over last year with really strong March month. I think last year actually I think we were a little disappointed with the capture. We had done some reorganization on the sales team and we did ourselves a little to service, and might have understaffed, didn\u2019t properly staff the sales effort last year. So I think some of that \u2013 weather was better in some of the Florida and Texas markets. This year it could be the sales team\u2019s efforts, it could be \u2013 so people who delayed the Boss system with last year and delayed purchase for a year, but all of a sudden they are seeing they got issues probably. The nice thing about those tax systems is, when a customer wants to take care of this insect issue and he has got that system built in, there is only one company that can service it. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 where open it\u2019s pent up demand and execution. Jamie Clement : Very good. Very good. Gary Rollins : I think I could summarize that. I think it was and Gary touched on the moving parts, but just more effort. We were disappointed last year the HomeTeam people were disappointed and I think that they have an aggressive plan this year and they just \u2013 they\u2019ve been attacking this thing everywhere that they know. And the results are showing it that they are successful with it. Jamie Clement : Can you remind us how many homes are out there with the system that have not been turned on yet approximately? Gary Rollins : I think inception to date and sooner I give you a number, I am no longer going to be wrong but 800,000 of these systems have been installed and there is probably close to 250,000 to 350,000 active customers that could be off on those numbers. Do you think all they need to retire? Jamie Clement : Gary, [indiscernible]. Gary Rollins : I\u2019ll get to some better numbers. Jamie Clement : Terrific. And Harry, you will be very much missed. Congratulations. Harry Cynkus : Well, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay. I guess that\u2019s it. We\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today, and Eddie and I look forward to the next quarter and we\u2019ll continue to work hard to grow and improve our business. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31st, 2014 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Before I get started, let me welcome our new CFO, Eddie Northen, to his first quarterly Rollins investor conference call. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Gary Rollins : I never get tired of saying this, so pardon me for being repetitive; but we are very pleased to have once again, achieved record revenues and profit for both our second quarter and first six months of 2015. For the quarter, revenue grew 6.2% to approximately $392 million, compared to $369 million in last year's second quarter. Net income rose 10.3% to $45 million or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $40.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the first six months rose 5.9% to $723 million, compared to $682.7 million for the same period of last year. Net income increased 13.1% to approximately $75.4 million with earnings per share of $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $66.6 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the prior year period. In a few minutes, Eddie will provide more details on these numbers. All of our business lines experienced good growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 7.8%, commercial pest control grew 4.6% and termite rose 3.9%. Our bed bug business has continued to grow and outpaces the industry. At a recent national bed bug summit, it was reported that the industry 7.7% back in 2011, and had maintained a consistent growth rate of 7.3% through 2014. As you may recall, we ended 2014 with record growth of 18% for our bed bug business. In the second quarter this year, our growth was even greater. There's no question that bed bugs continue to be a major test worldwide. Recently, I was referred to a book that was written in 1932, where the author cited numerous fears in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, where he said the civilized Austrian was menaced there by bears, and wolves and even more dreadful monsters such as lice and bedbug. Eight plus decades later, that same fear remains. Most recently, as being fueled by articles in the press, such as the one that states that bedbugs could spread to deadly, heart damaging Chagas disease. The consensus among researchers, is that its very unlikely that bedbugs will be responsible for transmitting serious diseases to humans. However, the reality is, according to information shared at the summit, its social and psychological issues arise when people experience bedbugs at home. Compounding those problem, unfortunately, doctors can't tell the difference between a mosquito bite and a bedbug bite. Given those dynamics among others, we expect our bedbug business along with our mosquito business to experience continued growth. HomeTeam also enjoyed very good growth in the quarter, with dollars and installs up 26% and revenues from new customers, those who have activated their systems, up 21%. As HomeTeam continues to grow with new customers, they are also finding ways to become more efficient. Three years ago, HomeTeam introduced their PestPac customer portal, which customers can utilize to pre-pay or auto pay for their services. As of June 30th, over 40% of all HomeTeam customers were on some type of pre-pay or auto-pay program. With these payments hitting the bank two to three days faster than by mail, and no debt entry is required by our employees, HomeTeam's receivables have improved significantly. As most of you are aware, we are continuing investing in our business to ensure we remain the world's largest and best pest control company. And as noted in the past, our marketing efforts play an important role in helping us to achieve and attract the most desirable customers. Last year, you may recall among other marketing initiatives, we gave our website, a facelift. Our objective was to better educate consumer, while demonstrating Orkin's outstanding ability to handle all types of pests and pest control related problems. We also began exploring opportunities to expand our presence with a different audience via YouTube. With a goal of gaining views and engagement and driving consumers to our web site. Based on the success achieved from this outreach, we have upped our game so to speak. This year, we have a series of how-to videos entitled At Home with the Orkin Man. This can be found on YouTube's playlist. To give you an idea of the market potential these present, searches related to how-tos on YouTube are growing 70% year-over-year and more than 100 million hours of How-To content has been watched in North America alone, as of June this year. Near one in three millenials, say, that they have purchased a product as a result of watching a how-to video. And 91% of smartphone users turn to their devices for ideas, while completing a task. I am guessing that most of you on the call at one time or another, may have been interested in learning about one of these video topics. How to protect your home from Rats? How to Remove a Wasp Nest? How to Remove Ticks? How to get Rid of Mosquitoes? How to Identify Bedbugs or how to Inspect for Termites? These subjects were selected based on our research to align with high search volume do it yourself. This is our effort to help people with their pest control problems, while making Orkin readily available, should they decide to use an expert. We are also very excited about this campaign, and believe that it will not only create goodwill for our Orkin brand, but also, as I mentioned, to help create consideration for Orkin, should the viewers seek an alternative. These how-to videos will also help support our position as the authority in pest control. One of the biggest components in making Rollins what it is, has been, and will continue to be in the future, our company's culture. We know it\u2019s a word just tossed around quite a bit these days, and can be defined as a blend of values, beliefs, priorities, and commitments, that companies develop over time. Here, the cornerstone of our culture and its ingrained in our mission statement, is to be the world's best service company. We are committed to that objective, and will always be driven in that regard. Last year, we concluded a culture survey of approximately 3,000 long term field employees, or culture keepers, as we have defined them. They know our company well, and are well qualified to provide their views about Rollins' culture. We then compare these results with a result of a separate survey of our company's leadership and found incredible alignment. This alignment, when asked what was important to the company from top to bottom, speaks volumes to how integrated, cohesive, and resilient our culture is. We felt that that was pretty amazing, when you consider our size and geographic reach. Another important part of our culture is our dedication to continuous improvement. Simply we know, we can always do better. And as we have discussed previously, we are always looking to improve our service to the benefit of our customers, as well as to improve our operating efficiencies. To that end, we routinely dedicate resources to study and identify opportunities to accelerate our growth and profitability. Later this year, we look forward to sharing with you more information on some of these initiatives, that are directed to improve our company. Following 10 years in the making, on June 4, we had the grand opening of the Rollins Heritage Center here in Atlanta. A dream of ours and certainly one on my bucket list, was to have a place our employees could be proud of, a facility that would house all the important documents and memorabilia that speak to Rollins Inc.'s history of over 100 years collectively. Among the many documents and memorabilia, our newspaper clippings from all work and advertisements from the 40s, letters from satisfied customers dating back to the 1900s, the last Ford Ranger truck of the production line, which is a gift from Ford Motor Company and also displayed as a replica of Orkin's official uniform from the 40s as well as a reproduction of a Orkin wagon used to deliver services during World War II, when gasoline and vehicles were rationed. I could go on and on, but would just say, if you find yourself in Atlanta in the future, we would welcome you to visit our center. You can also visit the Rollins' learning center at the same time, as it adjoins the heritage center. As a service company, we must be focused on the success and well being of our employees. As an example, we are pleased to announced that Rollins has set up a non-profit organization to help our employees in crisis. At one time or another, countless members of our employees have been affected by natural disasters, including hurricanes, flooding, as well as other personal disasters such as losses due to fire, medical bills, or other family emergencies. Employees may also contribute to the fund, however its not necessary to contribute, in order to apply for a grant. Our President, John Wilson, sums up our intent well saying, this is a great way to show your support and help fellow employees. We all care about each other and this foundation allows us to express that. Operationally, we continue to expand our roster of international franchises. This quarter, we were pleased to have expanded our presence in China, with the establishment of a new franchise in China's capital city, Beijing. Orkin now has four franchises in China and 39 in total throughout the world. It has been an exciting, busy and rewarding first half of the year for all of us. We are all looking forward to sharing with you the next quarters, and I'd like to send a well deserved thank you to all of our associates around the globe, who make our success possible. I will now turn the call over to Eddie, for an update on our financials. Eddie Northen : For those of you that might be tired of geopolitics, the only grief that we will mention today is the liquid that needs to be removed in commercial kitchens for a clean, pest free environment. That play on words is my tribute to my friend and mentor Harry Cynkus, who successfully reported this call for 17 years. As Harry has asked numerous times and I have been asked in my short time on board, we continue to struggle to find any direct economic correlation to our quarterly success. Our 6.2% revenue gain was accomplished by our outstanding sales and operations personnel, in the same quarter that the Wall Street Journal wrote the article entitled Retailers Hit by June Swoon.  As you all know, retail sales were not robust for Q2. However, we had a strong performance in the second quarter, with all service lines showing impressive growth. Key to the quarter, included strong residential growth and continued cost discipline by our operations team. Looking at the numbers, the company reported first quarter revenues of $392 million, an increase of 6.2% over the prior year's first quarter's revenue of $369 million. We experienced that growth across all of our families of brands, as measured in constant currency. Net income increased 10.3% to $45.1 million compared to $40.9 million, with earnings per share up 10.5% to $0.21 versus $0.19 per diluted share last year in the second quarter. For the first six months of 2015, revenues rose 5.9% to $723 million compared to $682.7 million last year. Net income for the first six months of 2015 was $75.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to the same period last year, representing a 13.3% increase in diluted earnings per share year-to-date. Let's take a look through the revenue by service line; residential pest control was up an impressive 7.8%, which is the best growth since 2012. Commercial pest control, up 4.6%, and termite was up 3.9%. With operations in Canada and Australia, the strong dollar was once again not our friend. The currency impact caused over a 1% decline on company growth, and there was no currency hedging offset. On the other side of this, our acquisitions made over the last year, Statewide and PermaTreat, and our most recent acquisition Critter Control contributed 1.4%. But all of that together, that means that our business excluding currency, excluding acquisitions, grew 5.7% versus 4.6% in Q1. As for the impressive residential pest control gains, we definitely had favorable weather in certain parts of the country compared to last year, but in addition, our sales staffing and productivity continues to be improved, and our marketing group is seeing traction, matching media delivery to customer opportunities.  Our residential customer base has grown 21 consecutive quarters and is quite an impressive growth story. Again for the quarter, residential, which makes up 41% of our revenue, grew 7.8%, excluding acquisition, 7%. Termite that makes up 17% of our revenue was up 3.9%, excluding acquisition, 1.5%; and commercial pest control, which is 42% of our revenue was up 4.6%, excluding acquisition, 4%. Commercial was again heavily impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollars, as most of our business in these countries is commercial. If you just look at our commercial business, excluding acquisition, they grew 4%, which does include a significant lift from fumigation. Fumigation had its best growth quarter in the last five years, up 16.6%. It would not be an earnings call without highlighting the continued growth in bedbug revenue. We enjoyed a growth of 18.5% in the second quarter or $17 million. Again staying with our residential growth theme, our residential bedbug business grew 27% for the quarter, which was very encouraging. For those of you that travel, make sure you check out our 'How to Identify Bedbug?' video on YouTube that Gary mentioned earlier. Here in Atlanta, as in much of the country, summer is in full swing. In total, leads received, leads sold and percent of leads closed, all continue to trend in the right direction, which bodes well for the future. HomeTeam had another great quarter, with improvement in their Taexx Tubes in the wall margin and improved pricing, which resulted in new Taexx activation dollars up 21%. In total, gross margin for the quarter improved 51.5% for the second quarter, versus 50.6% in the prior year. The quarter benefited from improved service salary with lower fleet costs due to the drop in fuel, while maintaining good cost controls across most expense categories, including materials and supplies. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter increased $637,000 totaling $11.2 million. Depreciation was $4.8 million, increasing $1 million, with most of that increase related to our new branch BOSS operating system. Amortization of intangibles was $6.5 million, which decreased nearly $365,000, as some of the older eight to 10-year old acquisitions have become fully amortized. For the full year, amortization of intangibles, which is typically from the value assigned to acquired customer contracts, will represent a significant after-tax non-cash charge of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 this year. As for BOSS, the deployment continues positively forward. At the end of the quarter, we were 38% deployed for the Orkin brand. With the pest business ramping up in the summer, by design, we are deploying at a slower rate until the fall. On a recent field visit, I was able to see the latest system release, a service manager check-in dashboard. This dashboard will give real time online display of all service technician status and progress on their scheduled services throughout the day. When we have the opportunity for a new customer same day start, will allow better efficiency and assigning the sale to the appropriate technician. Sales, general and administrative expense for the second quarter increased $7.9 million or 7.1% to 30.2% of revenue, increasing from 30% for the second quarter last year. The increase is due to higher sales salaries, which were driven by increased sales, related to payroll expense due to acquisitions, such as PermaTreat and professional fees related to procurement and acquisitions. Income before income tax was up 10.1% in the quarter. We had a few minor one time tax items that brought our tax rate down to 37.7%. We expect the tax rate to return to 38% next quarter. All of this resulted in a net income, that was up 10.3%. Our balance sheet remains strong, as we continue to look for more opportunities to reinvest in our business. Year-to-date, we spent over $30 million on acquisitions and continue to look for opportunities in the pest and wildlife areas. We had $18 million of capital expenditures and had $109.7 million in cash, along with no debt. With my first three months in the job under my belt, I am more encouraged than ever on the strength of Rollins and our business model, and the management team, as we continue to achieve our growth and profitability. During my visits over the past months, I have been asked about my vision for the future of the company, and briefly here are few of my thoughts. First and foremost, don't mess with what is working. We have a great balance of customer interaction and efficiency. Ensuring the customer has a great experience is a key to the industry leading retention rates. This is constantly in our sights. Second, related to the first, and based on my prior work experience, there is opportunity in the area of customer routing and scheduling. We want to find the right way to continue to enhance the customer experience by being at the right customer home or business at the right time always. And lastly, with the opportunity outside of the United States; our international operations and international franchisees are doing a tremendous job. I had a chance to meet with some of our international franchisees a few weeks ago, and they are very hungry to grow, and by country, had great plans to do so. As I wrap up, I would like to take a quick moment to thank all of those great individuals, that have helped to transition into this new role. From Rollins operations groups to the non-operating support groups, to the business associates, which include investors and analysts, that have all stepped forward to lend their support, I truly say, thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well we are ready now to open the call for any questions that you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Hey, good morning, guys. Eddie Northen : Good morning Joe. Joe Box : Eddie, you said earlier that leads sold and leads generated were moving in the right direction. Can you maybe put some more color around those metrics? I'm just curious if that direction suggests an acceleration or a deceleration from current growth rates? Eddie Northen : I think we are in line with the current growth rates. I think we have seen growth from Q1 to Q2 across all of the different products. And I think we have seen similar improvements from previous quarters for all three of the categories. Joe Box : Within leads sold and leads generated? Eddie Northen : Right. I am talking about for all three of those categories. Joe Box : Okay, perfect. And then you both alluded to sales and productivity improvement. Do you guys have a sense of what portion of revenue growth that you are seeing tends to be more market share gain-oriented versus just end market growth in pest control? Gary Rollins : Well we think they were growing fast than the industry. There is not a lot of market data in our industry, that would be current or quarterly. But looking at other businesses, through our acquisition activities, attending these summits, reading the trade publications, we believe that we are going faster in all of the elements. We think that we have made investments that other people are not or other companies are really not in the same -- have the same opportunity in doing, and that's had a lot to do with it, and then as I mentioned earlier, we are just not happy with where we are, we want to do better. So we just keep pushing in every direction or every way that we know to. Eddie Northen : Joe, this is Eddie. So the only small amount of science that's out there, that our marketing group is able to do, is to take a look at the total search -- total Google search under the pest control topic, and then look to see what percent of that, that we went. And we feel to Gary's thought -- to Gary's suggestion, that we are winning more of those than potentially the others that are out there. Gary Rollins : And I think that this is important, because what we really need to know is our internet work contributing positively and there is our advertising contributing positively. One of the great things that Google search does is, give us kind of an overall reflection as far as the industry is doing. If the searches are up in general, then Mother Nature, we think is making a contribution, and you got to be careful that you're not giving yourself too much credit. But in our analysis, we are growing faster than that barometer. Joe Box : Right. Okay. I appreciate that color. Last one for me, just can you give us an update on the Critter Control integration? Maybe where you're at in that process, if you're starting to see any revenue synergy from the deal, and any of the targets that you're willing to put out? Eddie Northen : So Joe, I think I am ready to talk about targets at this point in time. I will tell you that we were able to meet with the advisory board of Critter Control, have been in town and had a chance to meet with them. They are very happy with the way that the integration is going. I am not sure that you are ever going to have every franchisee that's always going to be happy. But 17 of the 18 that were in the room, were extremely positive. They are happy with what they are getting from a marketing support. They are happy with what they are getting from the back office support that we have been able to give them. And that's a little bit of the synergy that I think that we are going to be able to see in the shorter term, its going to be that. So we will continue to spend time with them, and I think that's going to help us as we are moving forward, and as we kind of develop our overall wildlife strategy. Gary Rollins : Joe, I think its important that we really don't do too much too quickly. We really need to get to know these people better, and need to really show, as Eddie mentioned, the things that we can do to their benefit. And then I think that will allow us in the future to consider how we handle the TruTech name and expansion and potential purchasing opportunities that we might have with some of the franchises that are interested in selling their business. But we are just trying to be fairly calm and solidify the relationship. Joe Box : Right, I understand that completely. Are you pushing leads right now from TruTech that they can't perform to Critter Control, or has that not happened yet? Gary Rollins : We are sharing leads. I mean we are -- as you know, we are in a lot of markets. Orkin is in a lot of markets that TruTech is not in. And so, I think that's one of the big benefits that this acquisition is providing these franchisees. So yes, we are providing those leads, and I think that fosters a sense of cooperation, and we are in a position really to help Orkin with leads, because they are not taking care of all the pest control or bedbugs and there is many areas in pest control that they don't really address. Joe Box : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And next we will go to Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, one on revenue and one on opportunities, long-term opportunities; on the residential side, it seems like a very nice acceleration. Is 7% sort of the new run rate? And if yes, why? Eddie Northen : So Dan, this is Eddie. I am not sure if that's the new run rate or not. I think if you look back as I said, since 2012, this is the fastest growth quarter that we have had. I think marketing field is very good with their matching of their media to the target audiences, which we feel is helping to be able to move the residential forward. So I am not sure if we know where that new run rate is going to be. The weather was good around most of the country, as we know. I mean, a couple of isolated spots where we had extensive rains and those types of things. But overall, the weather was good, which would always push towards a good residential number for us. Dan Dolev : Got it. And what happened in termites? It seems a little bit light. I know the comps were tougher. Eddie Northen : You sound like me. Well outside of Gary's comments, Q1, we had a 8% growth which was a very positive number. And if you look back over the previous years and you kind of look at the two quarters together, you kind of see numbers that are in line or may be slightly better than what we have seen in the last couple of years. We could have had the end of March be a little bit stronger, where as in previous years, those first -- last couple of weeks of March could have pushed into April and made a difference. But I think if you take a look at the first quarter and you move into the second, you will see numbers that are relatively in line with what we have seen. Dan Dolev : Okay. One more quick one. Any color on this year's price increase? Usually take [ph] pricing. Eddie Northen : You just want color on it? Dan Dolev : Yeah some color on -- what is the impact, what's going on with the price increases this year? Eddie Northen : Yes, elasticity is still good, the testing January/February, then we had March and April testing. All the testing is showing similar results to what we have seen in the past. The [indiscernible] continues to give us opportunity to make sure that we are selling and sticking in the right areas. And our analytics group that we have stood up in this last year, have made a difference in us being able to really know and understand what areas -- where we need to be, especially from zip-plus [ph] perspective, and that's where we have seen improvements. Dan Dolev : Got it. All right. I'll get back in the queue. I have more questions that I can ask later. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thanks. Operator : Next, we will go to Jamie Clement with Macquarie. Jamie Clement : Gary, Eddie, good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Jamie Clement : A couple of random questions. You know, obviously the 7% number in residential was the number that most caught my attention. Gary, obviously Mother Nature is a component, housing can be a component, and I'm hoping that perhaps you can give me your thoughts on that. Digital marketing, obviously that's something you've talked about as a success over the last couple of years. As you look at the things that drive your residential business, in a 90-day rearview mirror, what were the things that kind of popped out on the page that impressed you? Gary Rollins : Well, you know, as I've told you on previous calls, I hate to talk about weather because we can't control it, but we did have good weather, and we're continuing to really work hard as I shared earlier was our Internet and our mobile marketing. I think that the marketing folks deserve a lot of credit as far as continuing to identify new ways to capture consumers. I think that we have aligned ourselves properly as far as really stressing the educational side. You know, more and more people are shopping on the Internet to help direct their decision-making, and we want to position ourselves that we are the authorities, and we're the first and hopefully the only source that they're looking to when they have a pest problem. I think our BizSuite and HomeSuite products or iPad products that we have for our salespeople, our people are getting more comfortable with them. We're making -- continuing to make enhancements with the field feedback. We have a better product than we had a year ago. I think that that's making a contribution as well. So there's just a lot of components. It's really hard to quantify that this one is 50% or this one is 25%, but -- Jamie Clement : No, that's very fair. That's very fair. Gary, if I could ask you about HomeTeam, one of the things that Harry had periodically mentioned over time was that -- typically Rollins didn't make a lot of money on -- if any really at all, on the installation of the Taexx tubes into the wall, and that perhaps over time that was something that perhaps the Company could make a little bit of money on; because it certainly was a value add for the builder. Any update on that kind of progress? Gary Rollins : Well, yes, I think we've increased it. You know, when the contractors are in trouble, which they went through a pretty rough period of time, you don't really have much of an opportunity to raise your rates. I think what we've been able to do is, now that things are better and housing starts are up and they're doing better, we've been able to slightly increase our rates, as far as our install rates, and we've also identified some contractors that we really have deemed not to be profitable. So I think that we've improved our margins in that regard, and we've been prudent. And I think that builders do see value. You know, very rarely do we ever, if ever lose a builder because they don't think that this is a great value-added feature for them to provide the new purchaser. Jamie Clement : Very fair. Thank you. And Eddie, one last question : is my math of about 800,000 gallons at about a $0.90 benefit in terms of fuel year-over-year, is that about right? Eddie Northen : We'll say it's a number between 650,000 and 850,000, and the price per gallon is going to be a little bit more than that. Jamie Clement : Okay, got it. Eddie Northen : Okay. Jamie Clement : Many thanks. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yup, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will next go to Joan Tong with Sidoti and Company. Joan Tong : Hi Gary and Eddie, how are you? Gary Rollins : Good, how are you? Eddie Northen : Good morning Joan. Joan Tong : Good morning. A couple of questions here. Obviously the residential segment is very, very strong, and I'm just wondering with the upside surprise on the top line, I believe we would have seen better margins expansion carry-forward down to the bottom line, but we haven't seen that. Last quarter, the margin expanded over 100 basis points; this quarter is a little bit light. I'm just wondering, is there anything one-time there that caused your expenses to be a little bit higher this quarter? Eddie Northen : Yes, Joan, we had a little bit of one-time expense, and there's nothing that's going to be recurring that's going to cause a degradation in what you've seen in previous quarters. We had a little bit higher advertising cost this quarter that was really just kind of a shift in some dollars from one quarter to another. And then anything else that we had, were really just one-time events. Joan Tong : Okay. And then the gas, lower gas prices benefit on the year-over-year comparison, how much is the benefit for the quarter? Eddie Northen : The benefit for the quarter for fuel will be somewhere around $2.5 million. Joan Tong : Okay. Thank you. And then let's talk about your commercial business. It was a little bit light last quarter, still very good results. You know, you're talking about 4% growth in the first quarter. It seems like you stepped up a little bit. We [indiscernible] like around 6% in the second quarter. We know that your competitors, one of your major competitors keeps talking about like you may be putting more effort into the commercial business. Have you seen any change in competitive landscape? And definitely the uptick of this quarter, like showing that, like there's some improvement there, so any color you can share? Eddie Northen : Well, I'll share two things with you, Joan. I think, one, we feel as though the commercial could have even been a little bit better. Our foreign exchange difference, which was a little over a full percent on the revenue, was mostly in the commercial area. I mean, most of our business that we had in Canada and Australia is commercial business. So we feel as though the numbers could have been even a little better. But we feel as though the use of the BizSuite by our national accounts group is helping to be able to maybe differentiate a little bit from the sales perspective, and they are able to use their information that they have to be able to lock customers in, as we are growing on the residential -- I'm sorry, on the commercial side. So I think it's kind of the combination of those two things that are helping us continue to move the commercial forward. Joan Tong : And any change in competitive landscape? Gary Rollins : Well, if you believe what you read, you would think so because I think that Rentokil and Terminix have spent quite a bit of time talking about their emphasis. But keep in mind, this is a very fragmented business, and more likely than not, we're running into locals and regionals more so than we are running into Rentokil or Ecolab or so forth. So it's kind of hard to really weigh that. You know, our intent is just to go after the business, and I think we did a better job this past quarter as far as our national accounts were concerned, and those things are kind of lumpy. I mean, you really -- you know, it takes quite a few months to really -- to make progress in that area because of the sales cycle. But I don't think -- I don't hear our people really talking about one or two specific competitors that's really giving them a hard time. Joan Tong : Okay. That's good. Thanks for the update. Regarding HomeTeam, I believe Jamie kind of asked the questions regarding HomeTeam's profitability level. Have we seen any improvements? I'm just wondering, is the HomeTeam segment profitability is actually on par or in line with the residential segment as a whole? Eddie Northen : Yes, Joan, I'm not sure there's a -- I don't know if we can have a direct correlation with residential and home. HomeTeam's profitability continues to move forward. You know, Gary talked a little bit about the builder side. So we have the consumer side that's continuing to grow. The new activations increased 21% year-over-year. So when we take that growth and now we have improved and enhanced profitability and growth from the revenue side with the builders, HomeTeam continues to perform really well. Gary Rollins : And we're continuing to benefit from some of the reorganization that we had at mid-year -- Eddie Northen : That's right. Gary Rollins : Where we had some consolidation and improved the efficiency of our field operation. Joan Tong : Okay. And then finally, can you update on your M&A pipeline? Going forward is that being more like domestic focused, or you are still maybe like you're trying to add on to your Australian platform that you have mentioned in the past as one of the very attractive area? But given the local economy there, with the oil prices coming down, and it's not exactly -- maybe the right time to put more resources in that space? Maybe your M&A efforts would be more refocused back to the domestic market? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes, Joan, I don't know that we're necessarily focused in one area or another. I think we are looking for the best opportunity wherever it is, and I don't think we would be taking anybody out of the pipeline as far as any of the countries that we are in. You know, if there's a good opportunity in Canada, we would take a look at that. We want to continue to find ways to build out our network in Australia. If there was a right opportunity, we would want to do that. And, of course, as we've talked about on previous calls, there are many, many opportunities obviously here in the US that we'll continue to look at. So we're just, were looking for the right company at the right price. Unfortunately for us, some of our competitors are paying dollars that are way above market rates, and we want to continue to be involved with opportunities. But I think we're going to make sure that we stay logical as far as what we are willing to pay and continue to grow in that manner. That's one of the great things about being here is Gary and group have such a great history as far as seeing how this overall market will react and just making sure that we are paying the right amounts, so that we can make sure that we are either accretive or we are able to improve in a short-term with any sort of acquisition. Joan Tong : Okay. Thank you. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go back to Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev : Thanks. Two more questions. You mentioned that you're not seeing your competitors so much or your big competitors are more seeing the local guys. But one of your -- basically your biggest competitor is making a big push into one-off services. Do you offer the same thing? Are you pushing it? If yes, why, and if not, I guess why not? Eddie Northen : Dan, we're really about the recurring revenue. You know, lots of people have asked me when I've been out recently about statements that our competitors have made on the one-off revenues. And it's nothing that we would turn away from, and if it's the right one-time revenue, we're going to still go ahead and be a part of that. But that's not something that we are out trying to chase. I mean, 80% recurring revenue, that's part of the success of this model for the long-term. When you keep the customers happy, they continue to come back. They don't leave. And we are able to keep the revenue stream moving forward. So, we would not turn away from an opportunity but one time, and it's not something we are out seeking. We are out seeking customers to be able to get them in for the long term. Dan Dolev : Got it. And then one last question; in your remarks, Eddie, you mentioned the three things that you're looking forward to your CFO vision, so to say, one of them was the opportunity to improve routing and scheduling. I know when you guys are talking usually about 200 to 300 basis point improvement from the BOSS system, are you seeing things incremental or an incremental opportunity to improve margins beyond the BOSS system based on your experience at UPS? Eddie Northen : I think it's probably too soon to say what it would look like. You know, my intuition would be that there's probably something else is there; I just don't know what else that that would look like at this point. I had a chance to spend, as you know, a lot of time in the operations, had a chance to work with some folks and try to understand a little bit more about what we see right now as far as routing is concerned. But I think getting more involved with that is going to help me to be able to answer that question better in the coming quarters. But BOSS in the short term is going to help us incrementally. Then we will just have to see from there what opportunities, if any, we're going to have after that. Gary Rollins : One thing that makes it very difficult at this stage because we don't have, I think we have maybe a third of our branches or 40% of our branches on, is the impact of employee turnover, the impact of customer retention, fleet expense. There's just a number of variables. And, you know, I don't think Einstein could figure out really, when you took all those individual components, to exactly what the outcome is going to be. But the more we do, the more mature these branches are that we've got on BOSS, the better sense that we're going to have as far as what the payback is going to be. Dan Dolev : Understood. Very helpful. Thank you. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thanks Dan. Operator : It looks like we have no further questions at this time. So I'm going to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate it, and Eddie and I look forward to next quarter, and we will continue to work hard to grow and improve our business. Thanks again. Operator : And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone for their participation.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well, three quarters of the year under our belt and we are appreciative of what we have been able to accomplish this year. We posted record revenues and profit for both the quarter and the nine-month period. For the quarter revenue grew 3.5% to almost $400 million or $399.7 million, compared to $384.9 million in last year's third quarter. Income before taxes rose 9.9% to $72.4 million, with earnings per share growing 10.5% to $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $41.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the first nine months rose 5.2% to $1.12 billion, compared to a $1.68 million for the same quarter last year. Net income increased 11.7% to $120.4 million with EPS of $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $107.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the prior year period. All of our business units experienced growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 6.2%, commercial pest control grew 1.5% and termite rose 1.1%. If you remove Canada and Australia from this equation, commercial rose 4.7%, residential 6.6% and termite 1.9%. Eddie will provide more information on these results, including the negative impact that foreign currency had and our acquisitions had on our results. The acquisitions that we've made over the past several years are continuing to contribute to our growth and profitability. Speaking of which I just like to take a moment to point out one acquisition in particular, PermaTreat, which we made in August 2014, which is personally close to us. Joe Wilson, PermaTreat\u2019s former owner and CEO was recent -- by the why recently marked his 50th year in pest control, began his career at Orkin in 1965. Joe relates that he and his wife were expecting their first child and he was looking for a company that provided a company car and we did. This was good fortune for both of us. He came on board as one of Orkin\u2019s first management trainees and in less than a year, at age 21 became the branch manager in Portsmouth, Virginia. In 1977 he ultimately rose to Division Vice President of the Midwest. Joe recalls that he moved nine times in his first 18 years with Orkin. He quickly adopted our company values and culture with the dedication for hard work all of which according to Joe has served him well throughout his life. During all of these years in building PermaTreat, he stayed in touch with us and his career came full circle when it came time for him to sell his company. He considered Rollins, first and only. Joe represents a number of alumni that have returned home when they sold their business. Needless to say some acquisitions are a long time in making. Few have taken this long however. We are pleased that Joe came back and thank him for that he has done to make a positive contribution not only to our company but to the industry as well. In an industry that has been male-dominated for so many years, we are continuing to make inroads and our initiative to increase the recruiting, hiring, development and retaining of female employees across all of our brands. One good example of this effort is a diverse group of eight female employees at HomeTeam. They are working towards supporting and developing women through customized programs that are designed to assist career advancement. After year of employment, women at HomeTeam may apply for this training program through the women's leadership council, where they work with mentors to meet individual needs and goals. Additionally, we are tracking our success in female recruiting in all of our divisions and brands. While we accomplished our success in a number of ways training both technicians and managers across the Board is key and is a priority for us. Every year we challenge ourselves to take our employee training to a higher level. We are committed to provide our employees with greater position knowledge, while improving their ability to provide comprehensive pest control solutions that will better meet our customers\u2019 expectations. This dedication has resulted in Rollins being selected by Training Magazine for 13 consecutive years as one of the top 125 training companies in America. At Rollins, we're consistently working to demonstrate leadership and stewardship within our industry. This spring, we were pleased to host a first of its kind three-day fumigation workshop for government and regulatory officials at our Atlanta learning center. Attendees included officials from the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials or ASPCRO and the National Pest Management Associates. The workshop provide Rollins an opportunity to demonstrate our expertise and professionalism by completing four different types of live fumigation. We were able to position ourselves as a technical resource and leader in the industry. Following the workshop, a representative of the EPA wrote, the EPA team was overwhelmingly impressed with the quality of the workshop. Being able to have the course at the Rollins facility really gave us the opportunity to better understand the different types of fumigation as well as all the planning that goes into each event. We also received a letter from the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials saying it is through this type of co-operative training that we can make positive strides in our efforts to assure that regulations adopted are practical, enforceable and based on realistic understanding of the true challenges and risk of pesticide application. Much of our success is the result of holding ourselves accountable but diligently evaluating ourselves. One such effort is reflected in our operational support group, a companywide team that reviews our products, practices and techniques to ensure that they're effective, environmentally thoughtful and responsible. In many of our service offerings, termite control, commercial and residential pest control, the products that we use are carefully assessed and were appropriate are tested in conjunction with the Departments of Entomology, at leading universities, including Texas A&M, Purdue University, the University of Georgia, the University of Florida and others. We\u2019re also attentive to staying abreast of new and emerging pest-related issue. In this regard, we benefit from our relationships with various universities in the earlier named agencies to help us objectively develop the best treatment methods for our services. In the quarter, Gregory Mark Beavers join Rollins as the Managing Director of Technical Services. Mark is responsible for our company\u2019s technical support that I\u2019ve referred to earlier as well as safety guidance for all of our Rollins pest control brands. He is a captain in the U.S. Navy with more than 29 years of dedicated service to our country. Mark served as a global public health and pest management profession and maybe entomologist. He has had significant U.S. and international leadership and management experience both as a scientist and a vector control specialist. Mark has published more than 30 scientific, technical and non-technical articles and delivered more than 50 pest-related presentations around the world. Mark earned his bachelor's degree in biology from James Madison University, his Masters degree in entomology from the University of Florida and his doctorate in entomology from the University of Kentucky. We're excited to have him onboard and he is already making great contributions. As we move closer to 2016, we continue to work on our training programs collaborating with our industry partners in education and product development and working hard to maintain our standing as best-in-class in services provided to our customers. The year is flying by and the next time we speak will be in 2016. We are gratified to what we and almost 12,000 employees around the world have accomplished and look forward to discussing our year-end results with you in January. I will now turn the call over to Ed. Eddie? Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. By most accounts, July was the hottest month on record and our pest control business felt the impact. With a very strong start in July, August and September moderated some. Unfortunately they can't all be as good as July. For those of you that have followed our story through the years, you know, the acquisitions are a critical component to our continued growth. Our PermaTreat acquisition that Gary just mentioned, as well as our Australian Statewide and All Pest acquisition are all performing well. We're feeling the currency impact of the Australian currency exchange as they continue to grow. Before I move on, I want to assure you that we\u2019re committed to continuing to use our balance sheet to grow through acquisitions and the pest control and wildlife areas with companies that are a good cultural fit and are available at a price level that will provide shareholder value. Recently in the market, there've been acquisitions to push the historical multiples above levels that we feel would not be beneficial to our shareholders and the company. We will remain active but judicious in our assessment of the opportunities in the market. This same discipline has created a very long track record of sustained healthy growth as opposed to short-term revenue spikes. We had another good performance in the third quarter with all service lines showing continued growth. Keys to the quarter included strong residential growth, continued cost discipline by our operations teams, currency headwinds and slower growth from acquisitions. Looking at the numbers, the company reported third quarter revenues of $400 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter\u2019s revenue of $385 million. We experienced that growth across all of our families\u2019 brand as measured in constant currency. Net income increased 9.5% to $45 million compared to $41.1 million with earnings per share up 7.5% to $0.21 versus $0.19 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Let\u2019s take a look through the revenue by service line. Our total revenue increase of 3.9%, included approximately 4.8% underlying sales growth and 0.7% contribution from acquisition, which was reduced by currency headwind of approximately 1.5%. Residential pest control was up an impressive 6.2%, Commercial pest control up 1.5% and Termite up 1.1%. Our acquisition of Statewide has lapsed. PermaTreat was included for one month and our most recent acquisition, Critter Control was for full quarter. Put all that together and it means our business excluding currency, excluding acquisition were 4.8% for the quarter. Again, for the quarter, Residential, which made up 44% of our revenue, grew 6.2% excluding acquisition 6%. Termite which made up 16% of our revenue was up 1.1% excluding acquisition 0.3%. And commercial pest control, which is 40% of our revenue was up 1.5%, excluding acquisition 1.3%. Commercial was again heavily impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollars as most of our business in these countries is commercial. Even with the slower quarter in termite, our year-to-date sales growth of 4.3% is in line with our growth rates from 2014 and 2013 at 2.6% and 4.5% respectively. When you view the domestic business excluding acquisitions and taken the currency into consideration, our residential revenue grew 6.4%. Termite revenue was up 1% and commercial pest control was up 4.4% with commercial sales lagging the strong residential growth rate. Our recent realignment of our marketing and sales programs produced the strongest quarter of the year in the areas of leads received, leads sold and leads closure percentage. This will produce enhanced results in the coming quarters. HomeTeam had another great quarter with improvements in their Taexx margins of 2.2% and improved pricing by 3%, which resulted in new Taexx activation dollars up by 14.7%. In total, gross margin for the quarter improved to 51.1 for the third quarter versus 50.9 in the prior year. The margin for the quarter benefited from lower fleet costs due to a decrease in fuel prices and lower materials and supply costs, offset by service salaries for our busiest quarter of the year and an increase in personnel related costs due to increased healthcare costs. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter increased 2.5%, totaling $11.2 million. Depreciation was $4.9 million, increasing $672,000, with most of that increase related to our new branch operating system, BOSS. Amortization of intangibles was $6.2 million, which decreased nearly a $1 million as some of the older 8 to 10 year-old and older acquisitions have become fully amortized. For the full year, amortization of the intangibles, which is typically from the value assigned to acquire customer contracts, will represent a significant after-tax non-cash charge of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 this year. When we do pest control acquisitions, they are sold of any significant hard assets on the balance sheet. And as a result, most of the valuation ends up being classified as the customer contracts, goodwill and other intangible assets. We currently carry $96 million of these dollars from acquisitions on our balance sheet. With additional acquisitions ongoing in the future and current amortization running approximately $27 million a year, we will have more than a few years of this expense flowing through the P&L. For an update, we see little risk of possible impairment charges. All of the businesses we have acquired have grown as we continue to write-down the value of the customer contracts recognized at the time of acquisition, while fully expensing the cost of any new customer acquisitions. As for BOSS, the deployment continues forward positively. At the end of the quarter, we were 41% deployed for the Orkin brand. By design, we deployed at a slower rate until we got through the heavy pest season. In order to achieve desired, improved results, we have decided to deploy at a slightly faster rate, which will include the heavy pest season of 2016. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased 2.7% to 30.5% of revenues. The decrease in costs and percent of revenue were impacted due to a reduction in bad debt, reduced gas costs, lower professional services and lower administrative salaries as a percent of revenue. This is partially offset by higher sales, salaries and personnel related expenses, as well as insurance expense as auto claims have increased. Income before income taxes was up 9.9% in the quarter. We had reversal of the deferred tax liability that brought our tax rate down to 37.8%, which resulted in net income that was up 9.5%. We expect our tax rate to return to potentially 38% next quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to look for more opportunities to reinvest in our business. Year-to-date, we have spend over $31 million on acquisitions and continue to look for opportunities in the pest and wildlife areas. We had $28.6 million of capital expenditures and have a $134 million in cash, along with no debt. As you may remember from our Q2 call, I mentioned three priority areas that I had identified, which included the customer experience, international growth and routing and scheduling of our technicians. We are pleased with our continued franchise expansion and earlier this month, we expanded our presence in Central America with the establishment of a franchise in El Salvador. Regarding the first and last items, we've taken several steps to identify ways to improve our customer experience to better achieve, having the correct technician servicing the right customer on the right day at the right time. We believe that this is one of our keys to our industry-leading retention rates. Over the past several months, we've been testing a routing and scheduling software provider as a BOSS partner. Unfortunately, their products would not work for us as promised. We will take these learnings and we continue to pursue the right technology solution to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and improve our route efficiency. We are currently evaluating two additional alternative partners for routing and scheduling. We look forward to having a good 2015. And I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are ready now to open the call for any questions that you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from James Clement from Macquarie. Your line is open. James Clement : All right. Gary, Eddie. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Sure. Good morning. James Clement : So first question, the comment that you made about accelerating the branch operating system rollout plan into 2016, it sounds like -- to me it sounds like that\u2019s a function of having another year under your belt here and having it go pretty well. Is there anything we need to be aware of from a cost perspective as we look at more sort of the heavy seasonal season to 2016, or is there going to be increased costs as a result of that or is it not really anything that we need to worry about? Gary Rollins : James, it\u2019s actually going to be the opposite of that. We actually learned as we went through the rollout during 2015. But as we begin the rollout and then we stop the rollout during the middle of the year and then picked it back up, there were actually additional costs doing it that way. So, we are going to take those learnings into 2016. And the operations\u2019 folks have agreed to let us continue to deploy, which is actually going to reduce the costs that we would have anticipated that we would have had for the rollout for the remainder of the Orkin brand. James Clement : Okay. Very good. And Gary, if I can ask one a follow-up from some of your prepared remarks. You mentioned some of the workshop that you had with some of the federal agencies and some of the industry trade groups and that sort of thing. Has that become a more important piece of how you look to manage the business in the wake of how the regulatory environment is kind of gotten much more strict, let\u2019s say on steady base over the last 10 to 20 years? Gary Rollins : I don\u2019t really think. I think we\u2019ve gotten better at it but I think it\u2019s always been our priority for us. I mean, every opportunity that we have to put on training session with these folks, we have act in order. In fact, the previous one that we did was on termite tree and we had the APAP there. I think we had some of the CVCP over there. So, we attained their conventions. This is especially Escrow, which is the state regulatory group. We monitor the visits that our region managers make to the local state regulatory people. We want to have a very good relationship. So, I don\u2019t think -- I think as I said, I think we\u2019ve gotten better but I think we\u2019ve always had a priority as far as our relationships with those people. James Clement : And then the last question and thanks very much for taking it is. Comments on the routing and scheduling system, if my memory serves me correctly and I could certainly be wrong here, I can\u2019t remember, was it code name Orion, the system a number of years ago that was tried on routing and scheduling. Are there any similarities to kind of this particular process and the process, the experience you had a number of years ago, because both of them had seemed like there was some cautious optimism and now it seems like kind of back to square one again? Eddie Northen : Well, Jamie, I can\u2019t speak to the Orion, I can speak to what I have learned from gathering information as we\u2019ve been taking this new project on. And I know that there were functionality that concerns with the Orion. With the latest review that we\u2019ve had, with the latest vendor part of it was cost and part of it was the capabilities that they would have in order to be able to do it, I\u2019d call dynamic routing and not being able to fulfill the need that I think we would want to have for a long term. James Clement : Okay. Eddie Northen : So we know that there are other vendors and other options that are out there. We just wondered on this call to give you an update because this is one of the things that we've identified that we\u2019re going to tackle and we\u2019re going to be successful as we move forward. But we have had a little bit of a setback, but we\u2019re all in agreement that it\u2019s the right step to take these learnings and to move on as we\u2019re evaluating these other vendors. James Clement : Terrific. Thank you both very much for your time. Gary Rollins : Jamie I can add about the Orion situation. Eddie have a good excuse, I don\u2019t have one. In fact, it was my watch. We didn't have the right architecture. We really had learned from our mistakes. We didn't have the capacity to really handle all of our locations and this was very painful for us. And I think one of the advantage is you know what do they say fail early. I think I read that quote from the new Walmart guy and I think that that\u2019s probably what we\u2019ve taken that approach as far as this other vendor was concerned. We just didn't try to rationalize why it wouldn\u2019t work in or why said one thing or whatever, we just likely better spend their time finding the right partner. James Clement : Follow-up there, Gary. I mean, I can almost make an argument that you\u2019re actually better off not having gone further down the Orion path because as I understand it based on the technology that's available today that wasn\u2019t unavailable a number of years ago, knowing you all, you would probably be looking to upgrade that thing now anyway, wouldn\u2019t you? Gary Rollins : Well, I think you\u2019re right. I think the technology and the costs, I mean it\u2019s just like iPhone for instance. Then there was not -- and no one had even considered having a small, handheld phone device if you could log your services and transmit directly into the system. So you\u2019re nice to say this I have a hard time saying it was a blessing, but I think in retrospect, just the capacity that we have in communications now is so much greater and less costly. So definitely they have been good things that have taken place during this period between Orion and BOSS. James Clement : Yeah. I appreciate the time as always. Eddie Northen : And maybe Jamie maybe one last thing to close this out is that Orion was a multiyear project and our latest endeavor here has been an assessment for the last couple of months. So I just want to put that in the context as we\u2019ve gone through this assessment process to determine what the next steps can it should be. So we\u2019re not way down the path with this. James Clement : That\u2019s very fair. And I am sorry if the implication of my question was connecting the two that way. Eddie Northen : No, it wasn\u2019t, I just wanted to put that into perspective. James Clement : Great. Thank you all. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Joan Tong from Sidoti and Company. Your line is open. Joan Tong : Good morning, Gary and Eddie, how are you? Gary Rollins : Good. How are you? Eddie Northen : Good morning, Joan. Joan Tong : Very good. So Gary based on your prepared remark, I mean thank you for reminding us that Rollins is a people business. So, you take care of the employees and the employees take care of your customers. So you and I have spoken about it before, like during the recession you'd pick up a bunch of very good people helping you. And I am just wondering if when the economy continues to improve, do you have run into any issues in terms of attracting more talent going forward? Gary Rollins : Well, I think we spent this period identifying an address of the female recruiting efforts and all and that comes to another area. So I think we realized that it wouldn\u2019t going to be the same employment situation and so we really took a proactive step to say this is two areas that we really need to have more of these employees and just like managing sales people, we take numbers every month. We want to know who is moving the needle and who isn\u2019t moving the needle. And so I really think that we identified the opportunities that will keep us from having a fall back as far as our recruitment is concerned. Joan Tong : Thank you for the answer. And then in terms of your residential business, obviously it has been very strong growing at that 6%, 7% rate. And then also the lead generation closure, all the metrics looks pretty good. From what I understand is like you probably are going to be running into a pretty difficult comparison, because last year around this time we have seen like meaningful improvement in terms of that growth rate on the lead closure and lead generation. I am just wondering, this type of growth rate is going to be sustainable going forward, and what's really causing like any further improvement? Gary Rollins : I think that we have some things that have not matured yet for us as far as our HomeSuite and BizSuite proprietary software that we\u2019ve developed for iPads. I think we\u2019ve continued to improve that product. We are looking at our internal sales management software versus going outside and checking kind of the best in the class outside sources. I think that marketing still tells me that they have got a couple rabbits in the hat. I would like to tell you that there is no problem with this. There is a always a challenge, but I think like the recruiting situation and I think we\u2019ve been working on tools that will help us maintain this momentum. Eddie Northen : Joan, this is Eddie. So I don\u2019t know if you had a chance to look, but September a year ago was the strongest September on record for Rollins. So the comp with that obviously caused some headwinds for us for Q3. I don\u2019t know that we have that same issue when we take a look at the Q4 from 2014. And like I mentioned, when you take a look at the leads that you mentioned as well, those are showing significant improvements comparing the same time period to last year. So Gary\u2019s point, it\u2019s never going to be easy or always going to have the headwinds, but I think these are couple of indicators that show kind of moving in the right direction. Joan Tong : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then in terms of the cost side, any extra items like additional costs that you have spent this quarter related to the BOSS system, the evaluating of the scheduling module? And also how much is the fuel cost benefit for this quarter? Eddie Northen : So for the three questions, so BOSS, our costs are in line with where we had anticipated that we would be for the year. There\u2019s nothing it\u2019s been extraordinary there from that perspective. The routing and scheduling, there really are or no cost that have been a part of that, it\u2019s really all been taking our data, putting it into a system to look and see what the output would be. We've had management time, but nothing else is really kind of outside of that that is concerned. And we\u2019re closer to being able to give some more information as far as the benefits from BOSS. As you may remember, our first branch that went on was right at a year ago in October. So we feel for Q1 that we\u2019ll be able to share what we've seen as far as the benefits are concerned. But we feel good about the overall system to the point of wanting to continue to roll this out sooner next year rather than taken that summertime period off. So we\u2019ll be ready to share some more information with that soon. Gary Rollins : Joan, I think one thing is, we just gotten better. As the system has matured, there are enhancements that we convert every month. Our training knowledge is gotten better. I mean, we understand our help desk has gotten better. We have few questions. We have fewer inquiries. But as you would expect, we\u2019ve learned from our mistakes and I think that we\u2019ll have an opportunity that the more mature BOSS branches will be able to contribute to the cost of the second phase of rollout. Joan Tong : Okay. And then just follow up on the gasoline price is being like cheaper this year and it seems like that benefits done a roll off at the end of 2015. Just can you give us an update like in terms of how much cost benefits like year-over-year during the third quarter you got from the low gasoline prices? Eddie Northen : So during the third quarter, we have roughly between 650,000 to 800,000 gallons. We had a savings of a little less than a dollar, that's being kind of inline with what we've seen. We\u2019re seeing gas prices as we\u2019re seeing across the country continue to take down slightly. So we're still continue to see a little bit of gain, but to your point not the same gain that we would have seen year-over-year when we take a look at all of \u201815. Joan Tong : Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Gary Rollins : Thanks, Joan. Operator : Our next question is from Sean Egan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sean Egan : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Sean. Sean Egan : I had a quick question for you on Australia. Is there any more color you can give us regarding that market just given their macroeconomic softening which is obviously balanced by a pretty strong housing market? So I'm just curious since you're focused on the commercial side, what you\u2019ve seen in any additional details you can give us? Eddie Northen : Well, Sean, thanks for your question. I\u2019m sure if it\u2019s a good or bad to have economic down cycles. I would say that when you're earlier on in the process of building a business like we are in Australia, I would say, it would be better for it to happen earlier rather than later. And I say that because the operations have done a tremendous job rightsizing the overall operation support that we have in place there. We kind of inherited with some of the companies that we bought. But as we\u2019ve gone through and we taken a look at where the revenue levels have been, we\u2019ve been able to go through and make some really good decisions that it had help right-size the cost structure there that I believe is going to have us really be lien as we continue to have opportunities to be able to add additional revenues with potential future acquisitions. So we're just working through what we have at this point in time and continuing to make things better as we\u2019re continuing to right-size from a cost perspective. Sean Egan : Got you. And then forgive me if I missed it but last quarter you called out bed bug is particularly strong. And I was wondering if you could share anything regarding that line of business this time around? Eddie Northen : Bed bugs for the quarter were up about $1.9 million, up about 9.3%, little bit slower than what we've seen in the couple of the previous quarters, but the overall still a really strong year. Sean Egan : Got you. Thanks. And then my last question is just kind of systematic big picture here. When you guys look at the U.S. market and we see a lower proportion of homeowners and a greater renter population? How does that impact the way that you're kind of going about planning for your residential business if at all? Eddie Northen : Well, it\u2019s squarely on the mind of our Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Smith. He has put together plans for what he feels the multifamily unit look like as we move forward in time. At this point in time demand is as you know has not been dampened on the residential side, but we do know that as we move into the future that household formations possibly will look different. And taken a look at that is as total units, is that a total unit and a commercial property or the individual units that are condos or apartments or something else like that, is what we\u2019re going through and we\u2019re working through. We have some of that business right now on both sides. I mean we have apartment buildings and complexes in condo units that are commercial properties for us or commercial business for us. And then we have other individuals that were contacted if for whatever reason their building does not provide the support. So we see that advancing. I think to your question. I think we see that population advancing and our marketing group has that on their radar to be able to make sure that we are adjusting our marketing and adjust our operational effectiveness with that. Sean Egan : Okay. Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Gary Rollins : Thanks, John. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Denny Galindo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Denny Galindo : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gary Rollins : Hey, good morning, Denny. Denny Galindo : Yeah. I wanted to dive in a little bit more to the regional differences you\u2019re seeing. Your numbers are better when you exclude Canada and the international acquisitions and a lot of that was from currency. But did you see any softness in other and like energy states like Texas or were there any regional kind of weaknesses in the numbers this quarter or strengths as well? Gary Rollins : Yeah. So let\u2019s stick to the Canada and the Australia. You're exactly right with what you said as far as the currency. The other thing that we see there is that in those areas the predominant of our business is commercial and not residential. So we\u2019re seeing more of an impact in those areas that impacted our overall commercial numbers. As far as the United States are concerned, we really don't have anything that\u2019s material that we would talk about in any particular area. We would just really kind of talk about Canada and Australia when it come to those two areas. Denny Galindo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I also I wanted to delve into termite as well. So you kind of cut this a lot of different ways. But it looks the growth there did decelerate a little bit in the most comparable quarter-to-quarter analysis. So could you provide any color there is whether you're seeing fewer customers, any changes in pricing, any color on the mix of renewals versus new customers. Is there any more color on that termite number? Gary Rollins : I\u2019ll go back to what I said as far as the total numbers are concerned. I mean you are right about the quarter and the quarter is definitely slower than what we have been in a few previous quarters. But quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, the cycles are just different. And when you take a look at it in total, we\u2019re right on pace for our overall growth rate when you look at it in comparison to the previous two years. In Q1, we had an 8% growth rate for termite. If you look at that same quarter in 2014, it was one-tenth of a percent. So it just way different sometimes quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, based on what the nature decides to go through and have the bugs do what they do. Gary Rollins : If I can add one thing, we do a lot of benchmarking with our competitors. We've developed good relationships to kind of get industry knowledge. Certainly, we wanted to build up good relationships as far as future acquisition prospects. But termite business overall has just not been strong as it had been historically. And there\u2019s two schools of thought, one says the termite sides are better, the other one says that it\u2019s mother nature. If I had to vote, I\u2019d say it\u2019s mother nature. I think its just one of those cycles. I don\u2019t sense that the termite sides are better than chlordane was with some of the other products. But it is out there and what we have to do is work in the areas that we can control and that\u2019s retention and pricing. In those areas, and just hope that Mother Nature responds. So if we were just asked, I would really be concerned and regrettably its kind of industry wide situation. Eddie Northen : And Denny, to Gary\u2019s points, we see this overall a termite growing at a slower rate than what we see in the pest control area. And we just go through and look and see what it is that we can do as far as growing, taking market share, and we\u2019ve taken whatever smaller amount of new customers that are out there. So we can do. That\u2019s the reason why I think the growth rate still being in line still point to the fact that even in a slower growing area such as termite, we are still getting a healthy market share. Denny Galindo : Okay, that's great. That was a lot of detail there. The last one is kind of a big picture question. You mentioned in your prepared comments about a competitor that had been coming into the market and paying very high multiples, which we noticed as well. But I wondered if you could talk about how they might impact the industry especially in the commercial piece? It does seem like that a recent acquisition they\u2019ve made and there global operation that there are a little bit more focused on a bundled product then you guys are, some of the other guys in industry. So, I wonder if you could talk about the strength and weaknesses of a bundled product versus a more focused product. And how you see that that impact in industry overall? Gary Rollins : So Denny, when you say bundled product, once you have to find that for me. Eddie Northen : Okay. Providing other services this to a commercial customer besides this pest control looking at like, auditing or other types of services that might be interested? Gary Rollins : Right. Are you talking about add-on services? Eddie Northen : I think you talking about like other things. So when competitor may go and do hand washing so the different thing like that. Denny Galindo : Exactly, yes. Eddie Northen : So, Denny, what all I say to that is that, we are a number one in pest control. We are number one in residential and commercial pest control. We are number two in termite. Those are the areas that we have concentrated on. And while other companies have different models that they feel will -- that they can go through and cross-sell, our philosophy is that we\u2019re going to be a pest control in wild life and we are going to be the best at that which we feel is so absolutely we are. We are not going to dilute what is that we do. We are going to provide the best possible customer service, which is going to enable us to have that the leading retention rates in the industry. And while the other models have their pros and cons, our philosophy is this is the lane that we stay in, we are the best at it and we are just going to continue to find ways to get better. Denny Galindo : Any thoughts on how this new competitor could impact things either positively or negatively? Gary Rollins : I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s not competitor. Denny Galindo : Well not new but more aggressive I guess. Gary Rollins : Well, I\u2019ve not seen this before waste management team in the industry about I don\u2019t know 25 years ago, 30 years ago, and really started overspending for pest control companies. And putting together they are going to try to do a rollup and they had systems that didn't talk to each other. No two companies exactly running their business in the same way. And so we saw that that was a different situation, a different model. They became so discouraged they ended up selling it to service master at that time. I think there's always a situation that an individual that doesn\u2019t follow the industry very well looks at some of these multiples and thinks that their company is worth those same multiples. And I think that that\u2019s certainly not a positive. But we saw Sears come into the business. They hit the wall, waste management did that we tried to stay fairly close to these folks as far as how their acquisition is doing. And frankly, we haven't seen anything that really was remarkable. And I think we\u2019ve got a lot of good opportunities on the wildlife area, very pleased with Critter Control, very pleased with the TruTech. So we are prepared to shift our emphasis if we need to do that and we just have to wait and see what happens. Eddie Northen : Denny, one of the advantages that we have at Rollins is that we have Gary and his brother Randall that have been in the industry for 40 to 50 plus years. Denny Galindo : This is plenty. Eddie Northen : We are going to call it an advantage on this call since the call we\u2019re being recorded. And they seem to cycle, they seem to Gary\u2019s point, they seem companies come into the market potentially overpay and what\u2019s happened in the end. And really what the final measurement is going to be is what are the quality, what\u2019s the quality of the service they provide. Our quality of service is going to be the best in the industry. So the question is somebody else is coming in to try to do that with an acquisition. Can they keep that same quality of service or enhance that quality of service to point of being able to keep there customers. That's really what they will come down to and do it at an affordable price. But with discipline that the Rollins has had throughout the years, the recipe has absolutely worked to be able to add on at the right price and they continued to grow the business. Gary Rollins : I think another thing is this my experience has shown me is there is quite of bit commotion when this happens. Among the people, I think the employees in these organizations is sidetracked with the changes and so forth and I think that if we do offer opportunities, one as it may give you an opportunity to strengthen some of your pains. But the other thing it does well while they are trying to take their pause and figure out what's going on, they can\u2019t be concentrating as hard on the fundamentals as they had been and they need to be. Denny Galindo : Thanks, guys. Thanks a lot of great background. And I was wondering if there could be opportunity, as well as it sounds like there could be some share gain opportunities in the future. Gary Rollins : Yes. We appreciate it. Thanks, Denny. Operator : And we have no additional questions at this time. Gary Rollins : Okay. I hope that\u2019s a good sign. But as I said the years, this is slipping away and I just want you all to know that we not diluted that we are going to be working hard right up to the finish line to improve our business and improve our growth and continue to be successful. So we look forward to sharing with you how we finished in January. Thank you for your interest. Eddie Northen : That will end the call. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect at any time.",

Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Before I begin, I want to introduce John Wilson. We have another attendee at today's investor call. John is President and COO of Rollins. He is new to our investor calls but certainly not new to Rollins. You may recall that John was promoted in 2013 to President and COO. Prior to that John has been President of Orkin USA. He began his carrier as a technician and sales inspector while in college and joined the company full time in 1996, as a branch manager trainee. He's had various positions of increasing responsibility beginning as a Branch Manager, Region Manager, Vice President and President of the Southeast Division. He intended the University of Tennessee and he has completed the Executive Program at the University of Virginia, Darden School of Business. Rollins Board of Directors' named John an Officer and Vice President in 2011. John is doing a terrific job, he is an important part of our success and our future. We were extremely pleased to have posted record results for the quarter, as well as our 18th consecutive year of improved revenues and profits. For the quarter revenue grew 5.4% of 362.5 million compared to 344 million in last year's fourth quarter. Income before taxes rose 11.3% to $51.8 million, compared to$ 46.5 million for the prior year period. Net income rose 6.1% to $31.7 million or $0.15 per share compared to net income of $29.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the full year rose 5.2% to $1.485 billion, compared to a $1.412 billion for the same period last year. Income before income taxes increased 10.8% to $243.2 million compared to $219.5 million in the prior year. Net income increased 10.5% to $152.1 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.70 compared to $137.7 million or $0.63 per diluted share for the same period. We completed another record year in revenue and profits. All of our business lines experienced growth during the quarter with residential pest control up 6.1%, commercial pest control grew 3.2%, and termite rose 6.2%. We are also very pleased with our progress that our specialty clients made last year with all of those reported improved sales and profitability. These are nonworking pest control and wildlife companies. Their results underscore the value that we\u2019re experiencing in acquiring selective, market leading pest control in wildlife. Speaking of wildlife, our business there also enjoyed a good year. TruTech grew substantially and Critter Control which we acquired in February of last year performed above our expectations. We are very excited about the potential for this service line going forward. HomeTeam also had a better year as the housing market continue to improve particularly among the world class builders they partner with such as Lennar Homes, PulteGroup, Toll Brothers, DR Horton and Meritage Homes. Revenues for the full year grew approximately 8%. Eddie will provide more details on HomeTeam as well with the specialty companies in a few minutes. Installation and drive zone ancillary businesses which include bedbugs and mosquitoes, continues to perform well. Bedbugs have not gone away and we are benefitting from good revenue increases in aggregate. Some of you may have noted in recent media coverage that the latest threat from mosquitoes, Zika. One national news agency have headlined this article as disease perforate [ph], mosquitoes become public enemy number one. Zika is a rare virus that is not made any impact from its discovery in the 1940s until now. Like Guillain-Barr\u00e9, Zika is spread by the same species of mosquitoes which can be found in much of the USA. In the past year, Zika has spread from Africa and Asia to the Americas. Although Zika was first diagnosed in Brazil in May, it is been linked to more than 3500 cases of infant deformity. The leading experts predict that the USA needs to be prepared for a similar scenario. This situation is unfortunate. However based on our experience with the West Nile outbreak, publicity concerning mosquitoes risk will accelerate. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the success that we had this year with the rollout of our CRM system, BOSS. We ended 2015 with 50% of our Orkin branches on this system. In December, we picked up our pace and began rolling-out this branch operating system to two regions a month and currently expect to have all Orkin locations on BOSS by the end of the third quarter of this year. This is ahead of our previous target completion day. This time last year we discussed that one of the important advantages of BOSS was the feature of issuing iPhones to our technicians to help them better complete their customer administrative requirements. At the end of this past year, 2600 of our technicians were using our iPhones to provide customer better communication and acknowledgment of their service, while improving our branch administrative productivity. You may also recall that we recently completed the service manager check-in dashboard which provides a real time, online display of all technician services and status and where they stand on completing their routes. Additionally, this data can identify opportunities for a newly sole customer to receive a same-day service store. These are just two examples of major benefits to systems providing and improving customer service, while making our operations more efficient. Our technology team wasn't solely focused on BOSS however. During this past year, they upgraded and replaced a number of our retired support systems, to provide better financial reporting and communications, while improving our customer experience and reducing costs. Our marketing folks were major contributor to our success last year. They continue to up their game across all of our marketing channels, digital, mobile, traditional media. And frankly, we are getting better at reaching our target prospects, and identifying the best channels in which to reach them. As you are aware, we established a in-house analytical team couple of years ago, to help us better understand our customer's preferences and to know more about price elasticity. Their contribution is allowing us to take our marketing plans to another level. Like so much of what we do, we see the marketing of our brands is a work in progress. It just keeps evolving and we look forward to even greater contributions in this area in the future. We also continue to add to our roster of franchises globally having established a total of seven international franchises in the first half of the year. We opened franchises in India, China, Central America, and Mexico. In the fourth quarter we announced that Orkin extended its presence in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia with the addition of nine new franchises. These new franchises are located in Mexico, Columbia, Republic of Georgia, Qatar, China and South Korea. As of this date we have 48 international franchises. We look to expand our franchise footprint both domestically and internationally while at the same time working more closely with our franchise partners that help to improve their business. Strategic acquisitions remain a priority for us and as in the past we will continue to seek out companies that are a fit for us in both the pest control and wildlife areas of our business. The service business is first and foremost a people business and our employees are our most important asset. A major priority for us every year is to prove on the retention of our employees. Our employee retention rate again improved in 2015. We continue to work with our employees to ensure that they are receiving the very best training if they need to be successful and to advance their career. We want them to feel that they have a future at our company and a career not just a job. 2015 is now behind us and I want to express how proud I am of what our employees and franchise partners accomplished during the year. The dedication to continuous improvement is the driving force behind our success. Equally important of what we accomplished and learned during the year is that we set the stage for initiatives that will help us continue to grow our revenue and profits in the New Year. We\u2019re looking forward to achieving another record year. All of our team members will be working diligently to improve the customers' experience. We look forward in discussing with you the progress that we are making throughout the year and I am now going to turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie? Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. I had the opportunity last week to attend my first Rollins leadership conference. For me it was a time to connect with many that I spent time with learning the business over the past year and meeting many other new faces. I share this because this event continue to confirm a key reason for our consistent performance, the depth of our strong management teams. That consistency continued with our 39th consecutive quarter of improved earnings results. Behind the record setting results are managers, technicians, franchisees, sales and support staff that take the continuous improvement culture and execute year-after-year. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks for the tireless efforts of each of these groups and for their commitment to these outstanding results. We had a strong performance in the fourth quarter with all service lines showing continued growth. Keys to the quarter included strong revenue gains, significant growth in the number of international franchises and Australia\u2019s improved profitability. That was offset by currency headwinds and slower growth from acquisitions. A few onetime tax events impacted the net income. Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenues of 362.5 million, an increase of 5.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenues of 344 million. All brands, all segments and all geographies performed well as measured in constant currency. For the quarter income before income tax increased 11.3% to 51.8 million but due to a less favorable tax rate created by our few onetime events, the net income increased 6.1% to 31.7 million with earnings per share of 7.1% to $0.15 versus $0.14 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. This year\u2019s fourth quarter tax rate was higher than the rate for last year\u2019s fourth quarter. At the end of 2014, we had a beneficial adjustment that reduced the effective tax rate and this year we had a few detrimental adjustments such as an increase to the reserve for uncertain tax positions and an increase in certain disallowed expenses that while small individually, collectively affected the quarter. Also our foreign taxes were a bit higher than last year due to the growth of our foreign operations. For the year revenue came in at 1.485 billion a 5.2% increase. Net income for the full year increased 10.5% to a 152.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share with EBITDA coming in at 288 million. I want to take a minute to highlight the efforts of our Australia team, as I\u2019m sure you remember a year ago we were sharing the successful purchase of our second company in a suburb of Melbourne. Even with the slowing economy, our Australia operations grew revenue 9.4% and is profitable for the year. We are very proud of the results for this team and excited about our future in Australia. Let\u2019s take a look through the revenue by service line. Our total revenue increase of 5.4% included approximately 6.4% underlying sales and pricing growth and 10.4% contribution from acquisitions offset by a currency headwind of approximately 1.4%. Residential pest control was up to consistent 6.1%, commercial pest control up 3.2%, and termite up an impressive 6.2%. Critter Control was the only major acquisition that was included in our numbers for the quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, we realigned our sales force which helped contribute to the impressive revenue growth numbers. With the use of our home suite iPad technology, the sales force was a large contributor to the 6.2% termite growth for the quarter. The use of this technology along with the opportunity to offer in-house financing through our own Rollins acceptance corporation has helped us to grow the revenue and ancillary businesses. In addition I want to recognize the efforts of our inbound sales group who did an outstanding job keeping up with the increase demand late in the year. As you know, this is normally a slower season for pest control but November and December were incredibly strong and this team did a great job working with the operations group in meeting this demand. All of these teams did an outstanding job. Again for the quarter, when we take out the impact of foreign currency, residential which makes up 41% of our revenue through 6.3%, termite which makes up 17% of our revenue was up 6.9% and commercial pest control which is 41% of the revenue was up 5.8%. Commercial was most impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollars as most of our business in these countries is commercial. As HomeTeam begins their 20th year of service, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting some of their many accomplishments that would have made our founder O. Wayne Rollins himself very proud. In 2015 HomeTeam grew 93,000 Taexx tubes in the wall installs to bring the life to date total to over 900,000 homes. In 2015, revenue grew 8.1% which was primarily driven by an increase in Taexx system activation of 16.5%. Also HomeTeam saw an increase in sales efficiencies which resulted in decreased customer acquisition costs. Due to its environmental friendliness and high customer satisfaction, termite baiting is becoming a preferred treatment method in HomeTeam growing pre-treat business. This has opened up a new area of opportunity for the future which offers HomeTeam higher customer activation and improved retention over alternative methods of pre-treats. In total, gross margin for the quarter improved to 49.7% versus 49.1% in the prior year. The margin for the quarter benefited from lower fleet costs due to a decrease in fuel price and lower service salaries as a percent to revenue offset by personnel related costs due to increased healthcare costs and higher material costs due to the increased sales. The company maintained good cost controls across most spending categories. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased 10.8% totaling 11.3 million. Depreciation was 5.1 million increasing 175,000 with most of that increase related to our new BOSS CRM system. Amortization was 6.3 million which increased 265,000 due to the addition of Critter Control customer contracts that will be amortized over seven years. For the full year amortization of intangibles which is typically from the value assigned to acquired customer contracts or representing significant after-tax noncash charge was approximately $0.07 this year. A rollout of us is ahead of plan. As Garry mentioned, we now have over 2600 pest control technicians with iPhone's and who are now paperless. We will give a more in-depth update on our Q1 call but I want to share another BOSS benefit that will also impact our initiative of improving our routing and scheduling. One of the benefits is our ability to schedule or reschedule while the customer is on the phone and immediately update the technician on the iPhone. This will have an immediate positive impact to our customer experience. We\u2019ve begun training on the routing and scheduling portion of BOSS called Virtual Route Management or VRM. Our IP Group has set up a support desk and put together seven training videos that will help the branches use the basic routing functionality that has been built into BOSS. The training will include topics such as route set ups, route territory planning, route optimization for scheduled accounts, optimizing routes and balancing route production. For the year cost associated with BOSS had a $0.05 impact on earnings per share and we anticipated similar impact in 2016 as we roll-out the remaining Orkin divisions. At this time we're still assessing the next steps for BOSS related to the independent brands and we will share those when these plans have been finalized. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 46.2 million or 5.6% but remained flat for last year at 32.4% of revenues. A reduction of areas of bad debt and lower administrative costs reflecting ongoing cost containment programs were offset by higher insurance expenses, higher advertising and higher sales salaries related to our increased volume. Our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to look for more opportunities to reinvest in our business. For the year we spent over 33 million on acquisitions even though we attempted to use a lot more. Our pipeline is full of opportunities for 2016 with mergers and acquisitions. We had 39 million of CapEx for the year and had 134 million in cash along with no debt for the full year. As you may have read last night the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2016. The cash dividend will represent a 25% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. This marks the 14th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% or greater. 2015 was a great year and I\u2019m strongly encouraged that we will have a great 2016. Our management team is focused and energized to continue to raise the bar for our customer service and this will translate into improving financial success. I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you. We're ready now to open the call for any questions that you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Clement with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Clement : Eddie maybe I can start with you, I was trying to understand a little bit better what exactly it is the BOSS and iPhone interface will do for your technicians and customers with respect to - when you\u2019ve the customer on the phone, maybe his soccer practice got changed, if they can't receive a technician a certain time, can you talk a little bit more in depth about specifically what this is going to do for you all? Eddie Northen : To take you soccer examples to someone makes the phone call, we have their phone call at the branch location. We have the customer on the line. Now we have the capability of being able to make an updated change based on availability of that technician basically in real time that the technician will be able to see on their iPhone. So it needs to be moved back a couple of hours or whatever would need to be done with that, assuming we have a time availability then we will be able to see that in more of a real time. James Clement : It\u2019s hard for me to appreciate this kind of thing, but what happens now before this capability is out there like I mean how do you handle this kind of thing? Eddie Northen : It\u2019d not have been as real time so it\u2019d have been a request to the branch, and then the branch from there would have taken the message and then the branch from there would have to go followed up with that technician and/or the branch manager, service manager would have to get back with the customer which that time may or may not have worked for the customer. So now in real time we\u2019re able to see you know this is the time it\u2019s available for this technician, we can tell the customer in real time this is the adjustment we can make based on your request and just make that a better customer experience at that point in time rather than having a back and forth or have a delayed response back to them. James Clement : And Gary if I could ask you one, you emphasized in your prepared remarks employee retention and you certainly highlighted training. I remember I counted the years a little bit long but I think it\u2019s about 5-7 years ago, somewhere in that stretch you all bid a fairly significant dollar investment in upgrading your training procedures as well as I think your training facilities if I remember correctly. Have you been spending above normal with some of these training initiatives or is this to use your word just always work in progress around. Gary Rollins : By the way you\u2019ve got a good memory. James Clement : I\u2019m not pretty sure. Gary Rollins : No, we\u2019re not spending, I mean we haven't upped the spending, I think we\u2019ve upped the sophistication. We\u2019re on the web now rather than using satellites to dish and so of course that\u2019s been a big improvement. And we\u2019ve just got better at it. I think that the quality of the training has improved and the cost of the communication is going down, so you know there is some offsets there but I don\u2019t think that we as a percent of revenue we\u2019ve increased the rate of our spend. James Clement : Yes, because Gary I noticed certainly last earning season and in this relatively early stage, this earning season seems a lot of services companies are in fact talking about the difficulty in attracting and retaining service desk for companies that are relatively similar industries. I mean it seems like you\u2019re bucking the trap. Gary Rollins : You're talking about recruiting? James Clement : Well I\u2019m talking about recruiting and retention because you know I think the good thing about the unemployment rate coming down is that folks may have more options, it seems like your retention is actually improving whereas I think a lot other services companies unfortunately going the other direction, although maybe good thing for America so who knows. Gary Rollins : First of all the various studies indicate the compensation is like three or four's that is the reason people change jobs or keep their jobs, and I think that really that our training has an important role in our retention, when you invest in a person's career that endears now to the organization. So - and frankly we\u2019re just turning up the efforts I mean, we have made a real strong effort to hire more veterans and more females and we take the figures every month and we\u2019re moving them, I mean we\u2019re doing it. And our referral program we\u2019ve been very successful this past year getting more employee referrals of a friend or a relative or someone to come to workforce. And our experience has been that that\u2019s a better hire typically than someone that doesn\u2019t have any association. James Clement : That is terrific color as always. Thanks very much for your time. Operator : And our next question comes from Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joan Tong : I have a question regarding competitive landscape. Obviously you have a large competitor came in you know to America and buying all these like different companies and trying to compete here on our turf. I\u2019m just wondering like have you seen any changes in competitive landscape obviously they have throughout the evaluation on the M&A front but in terms of pricing, have you seen anything changes they might be a little bit more aggressive and since they have a big target they have to meet to justify that acquisition? Eddie Northen : Yes, Joan this is Eddie. At this point in time we\u2019ve not seen anything that\u2019s bubbled up. I think the growth rate is again for the quarter. We\u2019re very strong, the demand was very strong. Their main area of concentration has been commercial as opposed to residential. But we\u2019ve not had any issues that I\u2019m aware of that have come from our sales group having to do with direct competition, having to do with that. I think the space is big and the demand is big and at this point in time we\u2019re not seeing an issue. Joan Tong : Okay. Gary you mentioned on your prepared remarks regarding the in-house analytic teams, I haven\u2019t heard you talking about that team for a couple of quarters and since you brought that up, I\u2019m just wondering is there anything more to houses to like - I remember it was a year or two years ago it was the Boston Consulting Group and then with all these analytics, can you be able to use it more going forward to maybe like improve on your pricing like look at price elasticity, like going forward just to help us a little bit more on that? Gary Rollins : Well we are learning more about our business, I mean we have the capability now of better utilizing our data. We have the capability now of experimenting more. We have a wonderful laboratory with our call center because virtually we can change the prices just almost instantaneously and look at our closure to see if our closure is improving or not and seeing if we\u2019re selling more units to the extent that to offset the price reduction. So we're just learning a lot more about our business. I don\u2019t think that we've found a hot button if you will but I think that in and out it was zip-plus 4 we can direct our advertising more precisely and we're getting to do better at hitting our targeted prospects. So I think this is just going to be an ongoing situation of education of us learning more and I think that we have some great opportunities because when you look at moving closure it\u2019s just a real important leverage for us as our sales are concerned. Joan Tong : And then if I have to look at the demographics of your customers, has there been any changes like maybe you are moving up a little bit in terms of like demographics and because those are life style customers they tend to be sticking around a little bit longer and not just like stick around for a year and then when the problems go away and then they're just kind of disappear. So how should I think about your retention? Obviously you can talk about regeneration that would be helpful. Eddie Northen : Yes Joan, this is Eddie. Retention continues to tick slightly higher each year, it\u2019s nothing dramatic but it just continues to tick slightly higher. And really when you talk about the analytics, that\u2019s really one of the areas that our marketing group has done a fantastic job with using the data to know and understand the revenue bands and breaking down our abilities to first of all win in the revenue bands and then also to be able to retain and then be able to price in all of the different revenue bands. And that\u2019s enabled them to now be able to direct our advertising to be able to make sure that we are moving to the revenue bands where we want to be involved. Revenue bands four and five, the higher revenue bands so the ones that typically we have better pricing with and that we also have longer retention and overall it's a good spend for us at that point in time. So that\u2019s one of the areas where analytics has been very positive for us and our marketing group continues to push us in that direction to be able to have more wins in that area. Joan Tong : Okay, great. And then finally it's on the model, I'm just kind of looking at the SG&A expenses. You mentioned that five-tenth impact on the higher expenses on the BOSS system for this year and similar impact for next year. I assume like you talked about the SG&A leverage there, that we haven\u2019t seen that this year. So I'm just wondering for the BOSS system, isn\u2019t most of the benefit going to be showing up on the gross margin side and then your SG&A probably still going to be at a heightened level for 2016? Eddie Northen : Yes for 2016 we will see that heightened level and we will see the gross margin based on all the anticipated benefits we\u2019ll have. We'll see the gross margin continue to improve and as we said the 200 to 300 basis points over the two to three years and we know that\u2019s going to be a piece of it from the impact on the cost efficiency side, and then of course we will take a look at any opportunities we have on the revenue side to continue to have a better customer experience, just like the one we just talked about in the earlier example, if we can improve that customer experience that should be a retention opportunity for us so that should enable us to continue to grow our revenue as well. Gary Rollins : Joan, we learned something as you can imagine when you get half of your branches on the system is it takes the branch some time to kind of integrate their new technology and understand it, which you have the training responsibility but we have expectations at towards reducing the mileage, and any talks about the customer experience which is first and foremost in our mind, but also the technician experience. I mean, it is very frustrating for that technician to have changes and not know the best way to get to an account and so forth. So we really think that it has employee retention benefits because we are creating a better job for our technician. Eddie Northen : And all of these benefits Joan are going to be what\u2019s going to help us, get to that total number that we\u2019ve talked about. All of these individual pieces that we will be able to see that in a gross margin area. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Sean Egan with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sean Egan : I wanted to piggy back on that last question and throw down specifically into the routing training that you alluded to in your prepared remarks. Recognizing that it\u2019s a moving target, when should we expect to see the training start to yield benefit within the financial results? Eddie Northen : Well, Sean I think every trained branch is going to be one day better at being able to improve their routes. So I think that we were going to see those branches that have, first of all, the BOSS capabilities. Second of all the training from the new VRM, and then the ability to be able to go through an implement, I think we\u2019ll start seeing those small incremental gains as we move through time. We have lots of branches around our entire network that have done a good job in this area for an extended period of time. Entrepreneurial spirits, they figured out a way to make sure that their routes are as good as they can be. We have individual technicians that have taken that on themselves. But this is going to help us formalize and get those out to all of the branches where we have the BOSS capabilities. And we will be able to go through, be able to see some improvements as they get trained and as we go through route by route, we\u2019ll be able to see those incremental improvements. So it\u2019s early to say, you here\u2019s what the X dollars is going to be, or anything else like that. But again, we\u2019re excited this is another area where BOSS is going to be able to be a benefit for us that we will be able to look forward with. Gary Rollins : No, I guess you can say there are average branches for six months. So we\u2019ve not mastered what we have and I think Eddie commented before about the 7 modules of training involving routing and scheduling. So you are asking the same question that I\u2019m asking our finance department and I got the same answer that you got. Sean Egan : I appreciate the consistency. Can you please expand a little bit on why each run towards favoring termite baiting particularly its an advantage you. If you could put that in the context and explain why that\u2019s a good thing for you. Eddie Northen : Probably there are a few different things. For one, it\u2019s environmentally more better and we get that question all the time. And not that what we use at all is environmentally unfriendly but anytime that you can use the bait rather than having any sort of a liquid would be something that will be preferred. So that\u2019s something that is going to be a benefit to start with. And then when we take a look at it from a cost perspective, we get a chance to be able to use something \u2013 basically kind of pay for something as we use it, as we go along. When we have a free treatment, we have to spray, and things like that. We have chemicals that we have to bring in and we have to inventory them, and this gives us an opportunity to be able to have more of a real time cost associated with acquiring a new customer. It\u2019s also a better way for us to have something that\u2019s visible and tangible from a recurring perspective. So we have something that we are actually able to go and be a part of with the customer when we talk about their recurring annual renewal, and it\u2019s grown very well. It\u2019s taken over a very well-known- the HomeTeam group has probably been shifting in this direction over the last several months. And I\u2019ve seen very positive things that have come out of their customers that they have been talking much about it. Gary Rollins : A pretty cheap treat historically has been that you go out there with a termite side and you treat the foundations and the slabs before they're put so forth. And there is not a lot of touch that you have with the customer. They improves the touch, because out there servicing those bait stations and so you've got more contact. I think the customer sees a greater value that other situation was kind of out of site, out of mind. And as Eddie mentioned, there is a lot of - customers are looking for more environmentally positive situation. Sean Egan : Briefly, you mentioned that your spend on M&A during 2015 was below kind of expectation or plan, can you elaborate maybe that was due to timing, availability of targets if it signals anything in the market? Eddie Northen : Well, I'll start with the last. I don't think it signals anything in the market. We spent a lot of time on a very large acquisition that did not come to fruition. And as we regroup from there, we move forward like I mentioned in my prepared remarks we\u2019ve refilled the pipeline. The pipeline is very full right now and we're continuing to move forward, but we had anticipation and hopes of moving forward with a large acquisition that didn't happen. And 2016 is a new year and we're ready to continue and marching down the path that we've very successfully been able to do for the last 10 plus years. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Roland Underhill with Underhill Investments. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Roland Underhill : I came on a little late, could you be specific about \u2013 more specific about the bed bug growth and did you touch on wildlife business growth? Eddie Northen : So we can start with wildlife. We will start with wildlife and we just said in our prepared remarks that it's growing well. We're very excited on how the Critter Control acquisition is performing for us. Its performing slightly better than what we would have anticipated which is a good thing. TruTech, wildlife continues to grow very well. So I think the combination of the two is going to be a very positive thing for Rollins Wildlife as we move forward in time. As far as bed bugs, we didn't go through any specifics rolling on this. For the year, for bed bugs came in at $72.3 million for bed bugs. And that was a 13.3% increase year-over-year. The much higher base is of course always a challenge when it comes to growth rate. And you know we've been tracking this back \u2013 you're very familiar with the story. We've been tracking this back to 2010. We were virtually nothing. We continue to grow this very well and again set basically an all-time record for the dollar amount of bed bugs that we have. The residential piece has continued to grow really well and what we're really trying to concentrate on here is to be able to do everything that we can to make this a recurring service. Any time that we have to go out and we have a one-time type of a job. It's much more difficult for us to ensure that we're pricing it correctly and we've recognized that. So even that we have great revenue growth in previous years, in some cases the cost associated with that good revenue growth has not always been in line. And we're continuing to get better with that. We're continuing to understand what the costs are and really want to move, continue to move in the direction of recurring types the revenue with the bed bug product. So when we have situations, we're just one off type of a deal. We have not been as aggressive to be able to go and win that business, because of the cost that we had associated with that. And then the last piece evidence is probably in 2010 there were very few players that were in the market. And overtime as media has continue to discuss this more and more players have come into the market and competition for some of these jobs has continue to increase. So we're very excited about the continued growth of bed bugs that has slowed somewhat, but an all-time high for us this past year. Gary Rollins : Well, also the industry was growing faster than the industry. Eddie Northen : Absolutely. Gary Rollins : I think that's a healthy indication. And as Eddie said a one-time service is really not what we want. We want a situation where we routinely inspect the house and that we guarantee against in best station and so forth and that part of the business is growing and that\u2019s the best part of the business. Roland Underhill : In the past on the TruTech and the wildlife business you\u2019ve been more specific growing well to be 8% to the 30% as been in the past, can you help us more there? A \u2013 Eddie Northen : We\u2019ve been well into the high teens, for our, for that growth of those businesses. Roland Underhill : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : And our next question comes from the James Clement with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. James Clement : Guys, question was about M&A and it was asked and answered. So thanks very much for your time. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Joan Tong : Hi, just have a couple of follow up. I\u2019m not sure if you can disclose that how we can actually be able to get down to the branch level. You talked about the BOSS system has been implemented for some branches for more than six months and I\u2019m just wondering what has been the margin improvements for those branches. A \u2013 Eddie Northen : Yes, Joan we\u2019re not a point to be able to discuss that I\u2019m not sure that will ever talk at about at a branch level. We\u2019ll give you come color more on a macro level and again like I said in prepared remarks in our prior Q1 call, I will be more prepared to talk about more specifics having to do with that. Joan Tong : Right. But over the long term to next couple of years, you are still targeting 200, 300 kind of basis points of margin expansion when everything said and done. So I\u2019m just wondering is it going to be more like a 2017 event we would see like a more pronounced benefit or we can actually see some of those like coming in the second half of 2016. A \u2013 Eddie Northen : I think we\u2019ll see some benefits that will come in. I think we\u2019ll see benefits that will come in at 2016. And then getting this to matured state is really, the key to being able to see those benefits. This again is one of the many things that we\u2019ve had that have created that margin expansion that you have seen over the last 12 to 14 years, this is just another one of those items that are in the line and I think we\u2019ll see some benefit from that towards the end of 2016 and by 2017, we should be relatively mature and be in the good spot to be able to enjoy the benefits of it. Joan Tong : Sure. And then really one last question my favorite question is gasoline prices, lower gasoline prices, the benefit as you already said what was that for this quarter? A \u2013 Eddie Northen : So we are typically about month of somewhere between 650 and 800,000 gallons that we are \u2013 the lower end of that, just based on the time of the season that it is, that\u2019s per month and we saved, roughly a dollar a gallon year-over-year on that. Joan Tong : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay, no more questions. Well, first of all we appreciate your support and interest and we look forward to sharing our first quarter progress in April. Eddie Northen : And I do want to say one more thing Gary is that, many of you are interactive at [indiscernible] throughout the years, and Friday will be her last day. So any of those of you that have interacted with her, she has been your lifeline to this office for the last 17 plus years. May I want to reach out to her and wish her well. She has been a critical part to this call and obviously to this office for many years. So just want to pass that along. Thanks so much. Gary Rollins : Thanks, Eddie. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a great day.",

We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2016 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statements and disclaimer and then we will begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on the call excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are pleased to have posted solid results for the quarter, which represents our 40th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, revenue grew 6.6% to approximately $352.7 million compared to $330.9 million in last year's first quarter. Income before income taxes rose 9.8% to $51.2 million compared to $46.6 million last year. Net income rose 5.4% to $31.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share. I\u2019d like to point out that net income for 2016 did not include a favourable non-recurring tax adjustment present in the 2015 net income figure.  All of our business lines experienced good growth during the quarter with residential pest control up 7.6%; commercial pest control grew 4.7%, and termite rose 7.4% for the quarter. This was the best performance in that area in quite some time. Eddie will provide more details on these numbers in a few minutes.  As we stated in the past, the strategic acquisitions continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. And we are pleased to have closed seven acquisitions in North America this quarter, as well as one in Australia. The acquisitions we made across the US add to our primary service lines : residential and commercial pest control and termite. These companies were located in Southern California, one in Washington state, two in Texas, one in Florida and another in Georgia.  Our nationwide branch network provides great merger opportunities with a dispersed graphical group like this. As announced in March, we are pleased to have continued our expansion in Australia with the acquisition of Murray Pest Control, which is based in Adelaide, Australia. This company provides traditional residential, commercial and termite service offerings through a mix of company-owned and franchise operations. This purchase will also give us an opportunity to learn first-hand about Australian franchises. On our last call, we mentioned the nine Orkin international franchises that we had established at the end of 2015. This quarter we expanded our presence in Central Asia with the addition of a new franchise in the Republic of Kazakhstan. One of the investments that we're making in our international expansion plan is the hosting of an annual summit meeting for our franchises from Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East, India and South Korea. This conference provides the opportunity for franchisees in these countries to share successes and to benefit from marketing and sales training, among other topics which help improve their businesses. These meetings are proving to be so valuable that we will be hosting our first summit meeting for franchise owners in the Asia Pacific region next month in Xiamen, China. Closer to home, we're pleased to have hosted here in Atlanta at our Rollins Learning Center a delegation of 22 representatives from the Chinese Pest Control Association, which included the President of the Federation of Asian & Oceania Pest Managers Association. We scheduled this event a day following their attendance at the National Pest Management Association's PestWorld conference in Nashville. The participants were anxious to improve their knowledge of the US pest control market. They spent a day at the center where they were involved in both classroom instruction and hands-on activities. The delegation received a variety of presentations on specific topics and information, including advertising, internet management, marketing and technical subjects. They also heard from several other Rollins departments, fleet, IT, purchasing and so forth which cover the role that each has in our business. It\u2019s proved to be a great experience for all concerned and we look forward to hosting visitors from other pest control associations from around the world. These events provide us excellent networking opportunities.  HomeTeam continues to garner business and recognition from its home builder partners. For the fifth consecutive year, HomeTeam received the David Weekley Homes\u2019 Partners of Choice Award. HomeTeam has been a builder partner with David Weekley for 10years and was one of the only eight companies to receive A quality rating last year. They also are the only pest control company ever to receive this award.  In addition to this national recognition, several of HomeTeam\u2019s regional operations have also received honors and awards. The company's Fayetteville, North Carolina team earned the McKee Home Quality Vendor award. This coveted award goes to the top five McKee vendors. Additionally, HomeTeam\u2019s San Antonio branches received the Pulte Top performer award for their outstanding service. All of these company teams are to be congratulated.  Recognition within our organization doesn\u2019t stop with HomeTeam. At the National Pest Management Association Annual Conference, Dr Ron Harrison of our company was recognized as a winner of the 2015 PCT Syngenta Crown Leadership award. This award spotlights individuals who have contributed positively to the growth and development of the structural pest control industry festival, as well as established ties with fellow business leaders, civic groups and customers. Ron certainly fits all of that criteria more and is very deserving of this important award.  Ron serves as Rollins\u2019 technical services director who joined us in 1998 and was instrumental in planning and constructing the Rollins Learning Center. Additionally, he helped develop our curriculum for service, sales and management courses and oversaw introduction of this training to the field. Ron was involved in bringing distance learning programs to more than 400 working branches. Additionally, Ron works closely with industry regulatory agencies, the academic community vendors and the media. Last month, based on his customer service excellence, Waltham Services\u2019 Peter Gorman was named by PC Magazine as commercial technician of the year. This award is sponsored by BASF Pest Control Solutions and recognizes pest, termite and commercial technicians who offer the very best service in the industry. I'd like to thank Ron and Peter for their contributions to our company and our industry. On our last call, the Zika virus had just raised its ugly head and was beginning to gain attention through the US media. In the three months since then, the concern about Zika has intensified. As an example, the CDC stated a couple of weeks ago, everything that we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought. And as summer approaches, officials are warning that mosquito eradication efforts, lab tests and vaccine research may not be able to quickly catch up. Most recent CDC report shows 346 cases of Zika have been confirmed in the United States. They recognize that the species of mosquitoes transmitting the virus are present in all or part of 30 states, not just the 12 as originally indicated.  Educating the public is an important part of containing the spread of this virus. We invite you to visit our Mosquitoes page or visit mosquitoes101 infographic on the orkin.com section of our website. The information contained there is designed to educate the public about the Zika virus and provides tips to protect one from mosquito bite.  Speaking of our website, I'd like to thank everyone in the company involved in the recent upgrade of the Rollins sites. Our sites now contain expanded information on Rollins, Orkin and our specialty brands. For those of you who utilize the investor section, we've added a significant amount of information that we believe will give you a more complete insight into our operation. We're off to a good start for the year and we look forward to discussing our progress with you through the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eddie who will provide you with details on our first quarter financials and further insights into our initiatives. Eddie? Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. Record setting revenue growth was a key to our 40th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings results. Behind the record setting results were well executed, targeted marketing initiatives and the performance for our operators, as well we pushed forward successfully on our BOSS system rollout during a very busy time in many parts of our business. We once again had a very strong performance in the first quarter with all service lines showing significant continued growth. Each of the quarter included robust revenue gain, accelerated cadence of acquisition, less currency headwinds that were offset by higher year-over-year BOSS, our new CRM system expense and limited savings from fuel. A one-time 2015 tax event impacted the net income increases this quarter.  Looking at the numbers, the company reported first quarter revenues of $352.7 million, an increase of 6.6% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter revenue of $331 million. Our sales and marketing teams continued to do an outstanding job in our balanced growth. For the quarter, income before income taxes increased 9.8% to $51.2 million but in the first quarter 2015 we had a large beneficial adjustment that reduced the effective tax rate that we did not have in the first quarter 2016. Also, our foreign taxes were a bit higher than last year due to the growth in our foreign operations. As a result, net income increased 5.4% to $31.9 million with earnings per share up 7.1% to $0.15 versus $0.14 per diluted share last year in the first quarter.  Tax credits are nicer when you get down than when you have to explain them a year later. Our investment involved in the associated implementation and depreciation cost as planned nearly doubled year over year. The BOSS implementation expense will begin to subside towards the end of Q2 and become virtually eliminated towards the end of Q3. We will continue to have our full depreciation moving forward.  In addition, our branch operations staffing has been pushed forward in the year with the increased demand that we had seen early in the season. One example following a smaller base is the increased requests for mosquito service, particularly driven by the well publicized concern around Zika.  As Gary mentioned, we recently purchased our first Critter Control franchises and we will be incorporating this incredible brand name into our existing Trutech operating model. Whether it\u2019s a need for the removal of raccoon, bats or cute little squirrels that make their way into your home, both Critter Control and Trutech have seen very good double digit growth for some time and the combination of the number one and number two brands in the industry will give us great momentum for growth into the future in the wildlife control category.  The combination of these groups moving forward will provide greater efficiency, positive growth opportunities for the brand and an enhanced career path for Trutech employees as they will be able to stay with Trutech or venture into their own new Critter Control franchise territories in currently targeted markets.  Let's take a look to the revenue by service line. Our total revenue increase of 6.6% included approximately 7% underlying sales and pricing growth and four-tenths of a percent contribution from acquisition, offset by currency headwinds for approximately eight-tenths of a percent.  Residential pest control was up a tremendous 7.6%, commercial pest control up 4.7% and termite up an impressive 7.4%. Our previously announced Q1 acquisitions were featured in during the quarter and Critter Control was the only major acquisition that was included in our numbers this quarter.  Our sales teams continued to gain momentum with improvements in the area of commercial pest control, residential pest control, termite and national account. Our National Accounts team has a nice win and pricing in all areas continues to be strong.  Again for the quarter, when we take out the impact of foreign currency, residential which makes up 41% of our revenue grew 7.5%. Commercial pest control, which is 41% of our revenue was up 4.6%, and termite, which makes up 17% of our revenue was up 6.7%. As I\u2019ve mentioned to many of you over the past month, today we will be providing more detailed update as to where we are with BOSS, share some lessons learned and our expectations over the Q2.  Where we are today. As previously mentioned, we have advanced our rollout and now plan to be complete with Orkin by Q3 of this year and are currently 80% deployed. This means that we have over 4700 iPhones in the hands of our service technicians as of April. This decision impacted our profit growth for the quarter but is setting us up for longer term enhanced profitability sooner. Lessons learned. At this point in time we have four regions that have been involved for over a year. And we've had a chance to compare quarter over quarter results for those branches for the rollout and app. While these results are not seen in all regions, we saw a reduction in administrative overtime by over 20%. Customer pest control retention increased by over 7% with more attention spent on the customer and less on the administrative cap. Miles per stop decreased by over 10% with the help of turn by turn directions given to technician, and a greater than 20% improvement in pest control bad debt as the administrative group was more able to concentrate on the important area of cash flow.  Overall results are very encouraging and we look forward to assessing these and other areas into the future. Please realize that these are high points and not branch wide accomplishments. As you would expect, our vision for the future with BOSS is very bright. Because of the BOSS conversion, our call center lead management system of contact360 is now embedded and we have all the benefits of technician scheduling, customer appointment by our call centers sales executive. Our sales force productivity will be enhanced with their systems integration into BOSS. Our sales force will now have full visibility to their higher customer base, can access by vertical or by geography. Today if a salesperson has time between appointment, in most cases they are cold calling, because they do not have visibility to their customer base. With this integration into BOSS, the same salesperson will be able to search their existing customer base in a given geographic area, and take the opportunity to thank their customers for their business and inquire what other services we could provide.  The customer now just has a standard pest control. There can be a need for other services. This will be a much more efficient process that will enable the sales force take their excellent results to the next level. From a cost and customer service side, the possibility exists for improving administrative efficiency in some branches from an hour's work perspective. Efficiently we think that there is the opportunity to focus our branch, administrative team to think in more on the customer service and customer experience rather than just the historical clerical item.  Another of our benefit is that BOSS is enabling us to take our first step in route and rallying the technicians more efficiently. On previous calls, we've mentioned the virtual route management for BRM and how this can help with our routing capability when implemented. For example, in a few of our Midwest regions, we started the rollout and the limited results have been extremely positive. Our first step is simply taking the work that is scheduled for the day and rallying that in the most efficient or optimized way keeping in mind all customer specific needs and working around them.  Based on our initial branch rollout, we have the possibility of reducing miles by 10% to 15% which frees up valuable time for our technicians to ensure they are better meeting service commitments and providing more time to start new customer business which in the spring time and summer is at a premium. None of these sales improvements, productivity gains, routing enhancement, and most importantly customer experience enhancement could be possible without the successful rollout. We're on pace for the 200 to 300 basis point improvement with the execution of this revenue, costs, and customer improvement and excited about the impact BOSS will have on our business.  In total, gross margin for the quarter improved 49.6% versus 49.2% in the prior year quarter. Margin for the quarter benefited from lower personnel related expenses as group insurance premium claims were down year over year, lower fleet costs due to the decrease in fuel price, service salaries as a percent of revenue, and better productivity. The margin decreases were partially offset by increased materials and supply usage as we enter our business season.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter increased 8%, totalling $11.6 million. Depreciation was $5.4 million, increasing 803,000 with most of that increase related to our new BOSS system. Amortization was $6.3 million which increased 66,000 due to the addition of Critter Control customer contract that will be amortized over seven years.  Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $6.7 million or 6.3% but slightly improved to last year at 31.8% of revenue. A reduction in the area of bad debt and ongoing cost containment program were offset by higher seasonal sales salaries needed for the increased volume and increased administrative salaries due to the accelerated BOSS implementation. Including our accelerated BOSS expense, income before income tax was up 9.8% in the quarter and net income was up 5.4% when comparing the favorable tax rate in 2016. Our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to look for more opportunities to reinvest in our business through technology and acquisition. For the quarter, we spent over $21 million on acquisition with the addition of select Critter Control franchises and other pest control opportunities. Our pipeline for M&A is full for the remainder of 2016.  We had $9 million of capital expenditures for the quarter and had $131 million in cash along with no debt. Last night the board of directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that would be paid on June 10, 2016, stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2016. The cash dividend is a 25% increase over the prior year\u2019s dividend. This marks the 14th consecutive year that the board has increased our dividend by 12% or greater.  We\u2019re off to an incredible start to the year and look forward to solidifying our technology improvement, support and improved customer experience coupled with productivity enhancements in the coming quarters.  I will now turn the call back to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you. We're now ready to open the call for any questions which you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : So in 4Q you guys actually quantified what the BOSS impact was for the year. I think you said it was a $0.05 drag on 2015. And I apologize if I missed it in the quarter, but can you maybe just quantify what the BOSS implementation was just so we can get a sense of where it is once it updates post 3Q? Eddie Northen : So for the quarter, with the implementation cost -- so if you're asking about the partners go [ph] the implementation cost was a little bit less than a penny. And if you remember back in the Q4 call we talked about what we felt like the impact would be pretty usual [ph]. Joe Box : Right, it was expected to be somewhat similar. Eddie Northen : That's right. Joe Box : And then I guess on that same vein, Eddie, you gave some nice steps in the BOSS system so far. I wanted to ask about lead conversion in particular. Are you seeing much better conversion with the ability to plan for your routes better and show up on site in less time? How does that compare for the locations that have been converted versus the ones that haven\u2019t? Eddie Northen : So when we take a look at customer retention, we look at that early, compare that also \u2013 those results also with the improvement we see from the revenue gain, the pest control retention has been better, pre and post. So we know that by being at the right customer location on the right day the right time, is giving that better customer experience which for us is the most important thing, that we know is going to enable us to be able to continue to retain customer at a higher rate. Gary Rollins : And Eddie, if I could add one thing. We also \u2013 the BOSS also gives them more time, which in addition to improving their scheduling, it also gives them an opportunity to spend more time with the customers. Joe Box : And just so I'm clear, are you saying that retention is the same on the backend with existing customers and you're also comparing it to, once a lead comes in, somebody needs some level of service and they're a new customer. And you're able to convert that lead into a customer; is that commonly referred to as retention? Eddie Northen : Joe, when I was talking about retention, I am talking about the percent of customers that stay with us on an annual basis. So what we did is we compare the same branch locations, in the same region before they went on BOSS and then after they went on BOSS. And those are the improvements that I was talking about. It\u2019s the improvement in the retention, so customers are retaining and staying with us at a higher rate for the regions that are on BOSS. Joe Box : That's what I thought. I guess I was more curious on the front end of the calculation, if you're getting a hundred leads, are you now converting 80 whereas before you were converting 70. And ultimately what I'm trying to understand is, has that resulted in a step up in terms of the organic growth that you saw this quarter, are there some other factors that are like weather that might have driven that step up? Eddie Northen : Warmer is always better for us, Joe, you know that. That\u2019s always good thing. We are seeing things move on both side, we see the improvement on the BOSS side, we see an improvement as far as our marketing efforts and sales efforts are concerned. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will move to Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley. Denny Galindo : Thanks for taking my question. I want to delve in a little bit into the termite strength. It\u2019s been good for two quarters now, almost like the Q4 strength carried into this quarter. Is anything different happening there, are you gaining share, is the weather just supporting that, on any other color you could give on termite would be helpful. Eddie Northen : Denny, termite has been stronger for the last couple of quarters. As we talked in previous quarters, some of that we see as cyclical, a different type of few warmer weeks in one quarter versus another quarter can help drive the numbers one way or another. But our sales group is doing a good job with that. And there they're continuing to grow their sales and they're able to close at a higher rate. They've made adjustments. If you were back on the call maybe three quarters ago, two quarters ago we made a slight adjustment to the organization, the sales group. They\u2019re doing a better job using -- the use of the technology which is enabling us to be able to close at a better rate. So home suite is the technology that our sales group uses. So really we have a better opportunity to put a better product in front of the customer to be able to sell. So before using the technology, before using the home suite, it was a salesperson that was trying to verbalize what the needs were to the customer. And now with the home suite, it gives a pretty visual of where the issues are, what the concerns are and it\u2019s enabling our sales folks to be able to improve their closure rate with use of the home suite. And it was something that we rolled out, we rolled the technology out, knowing that it was a good technology and just kind of assumed that everybody would look at it, know it\u2019s a good technology and use this. And when we went back and look we saw that it wasn't being used at the rate that we would have anticipated and we went through, we did a follow-up training, sales folks clearly understand the benefits of it and we've seen improved sales because of that. Denny Galindo : Is there any difference in pricing or I can make a bet versus liquid or anything like that the home suite is allowing you to kind of focus on more by having that product out there? Eddie Northen : No, home suite is really not going one way or another with that. I mean that\u2019s really just -- naming it to be able to sell and then where we are in the country and whatever the needs are as far as the customer \u2013 decision is made as far as you going one way or another, of course they would look better. The use of the technology has been \u2013 again has been good. We\u2019re retaining our sales team at a higher rate than we have in previous quarter as well. I think the combination of all those things are continuing to give us good momentum when it comes to sales team.  One, which is the last thing, last quarter one of the things that we talked about was our ability to be able to up on the finance side for customers and we have our in-house financing that we use just purely from a sales perspective, and we are finding that the sales group, at a higher rate and that\u2019s helping them to close and enabling us to grow at a faster pace than what we\u2019ve grown at in the previous quarters. Denny Galindo : One other one on mosquito, I've heard some people talk about mosquito could eventually be as big as pest or termite, and you kind of mentioned the Zika virus, so maybe you could give us some details on your mosquito offering, how it's different than competitors, how the kind of the business model is a little different? Is it more frequent visits or less frequent that sort of thing? And then any kind of outlet you have on how big you think that could get this year? Eddie Northen : Again it\u2019s a small base for us, it\u2019s growing rapidly, of course with the well publicized Zika virus, is that it\u2019s giving people a reason to call on mosquito but it's not something that we do, and we could live with, it\u2019s something that in a lot of cases, we have existing customers that would use this as another service they would use from us. I talked about our \u2013 the use of the BOSS information by our sales group, that's a great example. So we may have a customer that existing testing for customer, we call on them, and they contact with them and then we\u2019re able to go and sell another service at one time.  From the frequency perspective, it\u2019s going to be once every other month type of service, and for us \u2013 if a customer has the pest control and they want to add on the mosquito, then that\u2019s a very good thing for us from a productivity perspective. Gary Rollins : I'd like to add to that. Although the frequency of the number of times if your services is typically five or six depending on the market. But there is clearly a mosquito season and as winter time approaches and late fall and you don't have mosquito. So this is not a twelve month type of service offering. So I think that, to your initial question about is it going to be like termite or conventional residential pest control, because of that limitation, the response to that would be no. Operator : Next we will move to Dan Dolev with \u200eNomura. Dan Dolev : Thanks for taking my question. Just to return to termite, those swarm picked up in the spring, it was unclear to me. Eddie Northen : I don't think we used the word swarm but the spring time is definitely a better time when it comes for termite. And it has been warmer in a lot parts of the country. So there's definitely demand out there for it. I think the other thing, Dan, that we just talked about, I think are key parts of it, I think the technology piece, the home suite has made a difference, retaining of our sales folks has made a difference. And the ability to be able to finance to close the deal has also made a difference. I think when you compare those nice warm spring time in a lot of areas, that stuff has helped us out. Dan Dolev : Can you provide some more color on the very strong acceleration in the residential side despite the toughening compares, what has been driving that? Eddie Northen : Yes, residential again, from the sales perspective, has again done very well. Pricing has been good. And the targeted marketing efforts have really given us a chance to be able to know exactly what markets that we would spend our time and energy on and payback dividends for us. Again we kind of combine some of those different things and what our marketers have learned over the last probably four to six quarters, they put in place over the last three to four quarters, we really see the fruits of that, especially in the retention. Dan Dolev : Is that sort of a run rate we should be thinking about? Eddie Northen : I don't know that we can ever say exactly where it is. If you look back over the last three years you\u2019d see the ebbs and flows of commercial and residential. In 2013 we saw in our residential growing at a faster rate and then in 2014 you saw it slow down some, little bit of cyclicality, commercial growing at a faster rate and in 2015 you saw it reverse again. You saw residential growing faster and we're seeing the same thing as we move into 2016. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will move to James Clement with Macquarie. James Clement : Gary, I think that might be a need of a little wildlife control industry 101. If you could indulge me. Strikes me as being an incredibly fragmented industry, perhaps other than Critter Control and Trutech, how fast has this market been growing in your opinion, let's say, over the last five or ten years, how fast do you think you all can grow? And then last question, with respect to the branch -- at the Critter Control franchises that are still out there, both Critter Control requires the right to purchase those at certain intervals, at pre-negotiated multiples of whatever earnings they're doing. Can you just give us a little bit more info on the marketplace? Gary Rollins : Well, to give you a fair answer we don't know. This is the first time that this opportunity has come along to this Critter Control franchises. Franchisor that we successfully purchased never had an interest in buying franchises, his whole play was that he wanted to add franchises, he didn't operate. And I think that as a result there wasn't much of a market for these folks to sell. So I think in the range of the acquisitions, I mean there's some very large locations. And there's a very small ones. Our situation is we're trying to look where we have a Trutech operation, where we have merger opportunities. That\u2019d be the first priority.  If the big one came along and we didn't have a Trutech operation we certainly wouldn\u2019t acquire that too. So we're just getting our toe in the water so to speak but I think as I told to Eddie the other day I said the jumbo drums are beating with us acquiring two of these there's no doubt that the interest is going to exist and permeate is going to be dramatic, because now they have a buyer. The other good thing about it is, we're not getting into typically a bidding contest. We don\u2019t have, like pest control where you\u2019ve got three other potential buyers waiting in the wings. So I don't mean to deduct the questions, I mean, we will know more next quarter than we know this quarter. The other positive is that we know this business. This isn\u2019t like us kind of getting into something that we're not familiar with. Trutech the number two brand. And the number two -- although they are a distant number two, we have a wonderful opportunity, unlike anything that has come along since I'm been around. Eddie Northen : This is Eddie. So something to add to that, the growth rate has been a good double digit growth rate in that category for us. And removal of the animal is a piece of that, but it also opens up a great opportunity for us to take a next step with our customers. And that is to do exclusive work. So it\u2019s one thing to have apps when you're at it and examine, have those bats that are removed, and then it's a whole another service for us to provide to be able to close that off to the back and not go back into that at it. That's whole another service for us. But going in and removing of the animal to start with opens up that opportunity for us to be able to now do that additional service. Gary Rollins : Some of the market, you also have depending on the pests, you also have an extended protection plan opportunity much like the people with the washing machines and ovens and so forth that -- there are some pests you can exclude, there are some pests that you can\u2019t exclude. So we're able to offer an ongoing program or at least certainly a program that could go into the second year where they can extend their protection at a disk. James Clement : So Gary, not a particularly big market but kind of the mid tier sort of market or maybe even a little bit smaller than that, who are the folks that are actually competing with you all? I've been having a problem trying to figure that out. Is it, somebody calls up another local pest control operator and says, hey, can you fix this and the guy just gives it a shot and quote some price. I am trying to figure out who you compete with. Eddie Northen : Jamie, I think most of those folks are going to be one-offs. You\u2019re going to have an individual or two people market. There will be some of our pest control competitors that will have those folks as well. We -- in roughly half of our Orkin branches around the US we have individuals that have a feel that to be able to this as well. That\u2019s kind of the way that we've done it. And other pest control companies have the same type of thing. They'll have kind of hit and miss, they will have somebody that has this buildup, because it is a different buildup to be able to do that. Gary Rollins : The other markets that don't have that expertise, Orkin expertise, then they give those leads to some. And now that we've got this Critter Control link, then certainly we can generate revenue as far as these Critter Control branches are concerned. So there's a lot of different synergy there. And I think Eddie makes a good point. The pests have been there, the critters have been there for some time. As some of our branches have just been reluctant to get into that part of the industry and I think that's what we learned about Trutech is, when we had that specialization it wasn't secondary with Trutech. It was primary, and we saw how well it grew and the customer satisfaction rates were incredible. If you\u2019ve got a possum in your ad, you have a wife like mine, you're going to do something about it. So you have a highly motivated customers, almost like customers with fleece they don't want to know much about what it costs, they want to know when can you do it. So that's a pretty dramatic situation as far as, as a motivated purchaser. James Clement : Now, Eddie, just one follow up question to the some of the ones that were taken in a few minutes ago. The new financing option that you\u2019re giving to some of your new termite customers. Clearly it's been popular. It sounds like roughly what percent of new termite customers are opting for financing? I mean I don't need an exact number but just sort of rough ballpark. Eddie Northen : 20%. James Clement : So I mean I just want to make sure I'm clear on the accounting, so for customers that use this financing, you guys obviously incurred the cost. And you book the revenue as well, I would assume, are you booking the revenue over the payment period? Eddie Northen : So we are booking the revenue when the job is completed. And let me just make sure I am clarifying this, on this piece. The only reason we have this in place is to help with the sales process and to give that option for that. So what we had in place, basically 90 days payment cash for those \u2013 to be able to help with getting that deal closed. And this is a piece that has helped us over the last probably three quarters, we\u2019ve moved that in the right direction to be able to help with that. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Joan Tong : So questions regarding, again going back to the BOSS system, I just want to make sure I get it right. Understanding on the system this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, was there an increase or about the same? Eddie Northen : Joan, it was an increase. Our implementation expenses were much higher. We are implementing now our big division. So West Coast, California, Hawaii, all those higher travel expenses, higher implementation costs, and again we are doing it at a faster pace. So we\u2019ve increased the number of that we are implementing at the same time. So the implementation cost has been higher. Joan Tong : So the implementation cost of this quarter is higher than the same quarter last year. And I think you mentioned about penny, am I correct? Eddie Northen : Correct. Joan Tong : And then now it\u2019s 80% of the branches, or the Orkin branches have implemented with BOSS. So I'm just wondering for this quarter, did you actually the margin expansion that we are seeing that 40 basis point expansion, will you characterize that you actually have some sort of benefit like, quantify what type of benefit you actually get from BOSS like for this quarter? Eddie Northen : We\u2019re going to have some small benefit, I think, we will see and we've talked about a few of the things that we recognize as far as improvement before and post BOSS implementation, for just a reduction of overtime. We are keeping customers at a better rate, or stop for miles have improved which of course, would mean less gas, less fuel for us, different things like that. So I think there is a sprinkling of what we're seeing as far as some of the benefits. But again we have a very small percent of our total branches and regions that we rolled out that are now moving to the point of being mature. So as we move through the next two quarters is when we will start seeing more of those becoming mature and we will see more of an impact we think on that margin at that point in time. Joan Tong : And then like you mentioned by the end of the third quarter we're going to see everything said and done 100% implemented on the Orkin brand. So we should be able to see some sort of spending etch down a little bit. Is it the right way to think about it? Maybe in the fourth quarter, we can see like spending come down slightly? Eddie Northen : So based on everything that we know right now, where we're going, the implementation costs will be reduced or eliminated at that point in time, or depreciation once we are fully rolled out, slightly higher than where we are right now. And we haven\u2019t finalized what our next steps are going to be with the system related to any of our independent branch. So we're still assessing what if anything that we're going to do with that. And once we get to a point of making that final decision, we will communicate that as well. We're basically going through and taking a look to see from a return perspective that it makes sense to spend additional dollars to make adjustment to be able to implement it with the other independent brand. So we're going through that assessment but at this point of time we've not made a final decision of what we\u2019re going to do with that. Joan Tong : And then in terms of routing schedule, you sort of -- you mentioned that plain vanilla routing and scheduling module and then maybe a mobile desktop system or module later on, and is this doing in your words or you guys are pretty happy about what you have right now and you just kind of want to see how it goes before you move on to the next level? Eddie Northen : Yes. So the more robust model is basically shown on the table. However we are very happy with the opportunities that we are going to have with the virtual route management. So we know that we're going to be spending the next two quarters getting that rolled out, getting people trained, getting our measurement in place to be able to see it. But I have to tell you, it's been extremely extremely well received by the branch management, branch technician. Having the flexibility of being able to spend more time with the customers, having the ability to be able to ensure that, that technician is not having to change their appointments with existing customers. Because the days that are planned out are being received extremely well. So we're going to move forward with maximizing our opportunities with virtual route management, while in the background we're still looking at the more robust option as we move over time. Joan Tong : And then let's move on to HomeTeam. I think Gary, you mentioned a couple of things about HomeTeam. I'm just wondering like how fast is HomeTeam is growing right now, then the profitability of that division. And then also with housing slowdown a little bit -- housing starts slowdown a little bit in the first quarter, just want to see if there's any impact on HomeTeam, especially on the installation side. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Joan, all of the categories you just mentioned, we're not seeing any impact as of right now with anything housing related. I mean their growth rate, top line and bottom line, the housing with the new installs, are all moving forward very well, they are moving forward in the low to mid teens. So we are continuing to see good improvement with HomeTeam. Joan Tong : And then I have a final question regarding competition. Obviously, you want to have your largest share competitors, foreign competitors, have extended footprints in the US. And it's the second quarter into it. I'm just wondering is there any change in competitive landscape? Have you seen them being a little bit more aggressive in terms of pricing? Eddie Northen : We haven't. I don\u2019t know that we've really seen that. Our pricing for Q1 was strong across all of the service lines. It\u2019s one of the pieces that our sales group was able to be very successful with. I think the thing to remember when it comes to the other competitors that are out there is, before they move to the \u2013 new companies that are with now, we still compete it against them. So we're still competing just like we did with them before. But we really don\u2019t see any issues from a pricing perspective there and we've been very very pleased with how that\u2019s helped us with our overall growth.  End of Q& A Operator : Thank you, and it appears we have no further questions at this time. Gary Rollins : I'd like to thank you for joining us today. Eddie and I look forward to the next quarter and will continue to work hard to grow and improve our business and I would suspect that we'll know more about BOSS with another quarter under our belt. So thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect and have a great day.",

Management will make some opening remarks and then we will open up the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you, Marilynn and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2016 conference call and Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we will begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are pleased to have posted positive results for the quarter marking our 41st consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, revenue grew 4.8% to approximately $411.1 million compared to $392.2 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Income before taxes increased 6.4% to $77 million compared to $72.3 million for the second quarter of 2015. Net income rose 6% to $47.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to net income of $45.1 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the same period last year. Revenues for the first six months grew 5.6% to $763.9 million compared to $723.1 million for the same period of last year. Net income increased 5.8% to approximately $79.7 million with EPS of $0.36 per diluted share compared to $75.4 million or $0.34 per diluted share. Historically, the company\u2019s revenue and profit performance are somewhat lumpy from quarter to quarter. As examples, the weakest revenue percent increased last year was the third quarter. And in 2014, it was the fourth quarter. This repeated itself this year as the second quarter percent increase of 4.8% was a pace less than the first quarter. We think Mother Nature has a role in this regard and unfortunately we can\u2019t control that. After saying that, I want to add that all of our business lines experienced good growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 6.7% and commercial pest control grew 2.6%, while termite increased 5.2%. Eddie will provide more details on these numbers in a few minutes. The rollout of our CRM and new operating system, BOSS, went extremely well in the second quarter with over 95% of the working branches on the system by quarter end. We remain on track to have this rollout completed by the end of this current quarter. Eddie will also provide further information on this, but we are very pleased with our conversion and I won\u2019t express my thanks to all of our employees that have worked so hard to make this happen. As I have said in the past, we believe this new operating system will be a real game changer for our company. We are also pleased to have made our first acquisition in the United Kingdom, Safeguard Pest Control and Environmental Services. This purchase further expands our global footprint. Safeguard is headquartered in Westerham, Kent and provides residential and commercial pest control services for its customers in Greater London and in surrounding Southeast counties, which by the way is one of the most densely populated English regions. Established in 1991, Safeguard is a UK pest control leader, with a rich history of providing exceptional pest control and bird control and other related services to residential and commercial customers. The company has a wonderful reputation and management team headed by Paul Butterick and Tim Sheehan with whom we share a mutual commitment to continuous improvement. They will remain here to run Safeguard\u2019s operations and we look forward to sharing best practices between our two organizations. This quarter, we added 8 other pest control companies to our growing network. We are benefiting in many regards from these additions as all of us are smarter than any one of us. Earlier this morning, we announced several changes to the company\u2019s operational leadership. The first situation involves Gene Iarocci after a long and successful business career at Rollins and Orkin, Gene will be retiring at the end of September. We are most fortunate to have Gene on our team for 13 years. He began his carrier as a regional manager trainee in 2003 starting in South Florida. Gene was very quickly promoted to Louisiana Region Manager in 2004. And the by the way, Gene is one of the few in our company\u2019s history to have successfully operated a region without having managed a branch, no small fee. In 2005, Gene was promoted to Orkin\u2019s Atlantic Division President and did an outstanding job. 5 years later, he was elevated to Rollins, Vice President of Corporate Services. In 2013, he returned to operations and was promoted as President of work in North America. In this role, Gene led Orkin to pass the $1 billion revenue milestone for the first time in our history. Gene will truly be missed both as a friend and a valued associate. We wish him and his wife truly the best as they entered the next chapter of their lives. We are truly blessed to have strong leadership across the country. And with Gene\u2019s retirement, we have made several new assignments that will help us to exceed the $2 billion revenue mark. Freeman Elliot has been promoted to President of work in U.S., with the responsibility from leading five Orkin U.S. divisions as well as work in this national sales and client services teams. Freeman came to our company right after graduating from the University of Georgia at 1991. And like many of our superstars, started as a technician at that time, in our lawn care division. Following he successfully assume many other management roles, including having led two different working regions in two separate divisions. Most recently, he and his team have led the southeastern division to an excellent record of operational achievements. In addition to serving as President of home team, pest defense for the past 5 years, Jerry Gahlhoff will be elevated to assume responsibility for our Western Pest Services and Waltham Services brands. Jerry has been tremendously successful with HomeTeam in finding and cultivating outstanding employees that are making important contributions to our business and culture. Additionally, he will also be responsible for Rollins Human Resources and our training organization. Both of which help us recruit, educate and retain the very best people, our most important asset. Steve Leavitt who has headed our group of specialty brands will be leading our new emerging opportunities group. This group includes Orkin Canada, our Australian companies, Safeguard, the company that I just mentioned and any future international acquisitions. Steve will also be responsible for Trutech and Critter Control while retaining responsibility for IFC and PermaTreat. He is going to be very busy man. We have a great and experienced team at Rollins and worked diligently over the years to build our bench strength. Today, we see our efforts paying off as is evident from these announcements. Management development will be a never ending initiative as we maintain our crown of being the best pest control company in the world. I will now turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie? Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. We had a solid revenue growth that helped with our 41st consecutive quarter of improved earnings results. Even with accelerating BOSS related costs pushed into the first quarter, into this quarter as well, we had a strong 6% net income growth. Many of our operations have gone through a substantial effort during the very busy time of the year in order to get this project finished in August. Each of our service lines showed continued growth and key to the quarter included continued strong residential and termite revenue gain, new international market expansion, strong HomeTeam results and significantly higher year-over-year BOSS expense. Looking at the numbers, the company reported second quarter revenues of $411.1 million, an increase of 4.8% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter revenue of $392.2 million. Good steady growth continued in 2016. For the quarter, income before income taxes increased 6.4% to $76.9 million. Last year, we had a small positive tax adjustment, which didn\u2019t repeat this year. Our foreign taxes were a bit higher than last year due to the growth in our foreign operations. And as a result, net income increased 6% to $47.8 million with earnings per share of 4.8% to $0.22 versus $0.21 per diluted share last year in the second quarter. I will talk in a few minutes about our BOSS results to-date, but first I want to circle back to share some of the tremendous results that HomeTeam continues to produce. As they approach their milestone 1 million Taexx tubes in the wall pest control installations since inception they continued double-digit installation growth. Year-to-date, new installations were up 11.6%. Each install gives us an opportunity for HomeTeam to capture a new recurring pest control customer. Part of the continued overall Rollins termite success can be attributed to the excellent builder pre-treat and recurring termite customers of HomeTeam. This service is offered when HomeTeam works with builders during the new construction phase. Year-to-date, the number of homes receiving this pretreatment service has grown 12%. This installation opens the door for HomeTeam to continue to provide termite protection to that customer on a recurring basis moving forward, plus they enjoy the prospect of a potential pest control customer. Let\u2019s take a look through the revenue by service line. Our total revenue increased to 4.8%, which included a small 0.04% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.4% was from pricing and organic growth. Residential pest control was up a solid 6.7%, commercial pest control up 2.6% and termite up strong 5.2%. During the quarter, we acquired Murray Pest Control in Australia, which made a positive impact on our termite business. And as I mentioned earlier, HomeTeam has been a key to our continued termite gains. As I have mentioned earlier, we have pushed a lot of expense into the first and second quarters to get this rollout wrapped up. But we are very pleased to see improvement that BOSS is producing on a limited basis today. Since the last call, we have added 1,200 new pest control and termite control iPhone equipped technicians to BOSS for a total of over 5300 active users. For those of you that are bit more tech-savvy, BOSS is a greatly improved platform that enables integration and products, which will speed the delivery of future enhancements. Separately from that, we see the business benefits to-date falling into three buckets employee, customer and financial. Starting with employee benefits, millennials to our most season employees love the ease of use and professional presence with the customer by moving from the old CN50 handheld to the new iPhone. The system helps to organize today for the technician and allow the needed changes to the route throughout the day. This is another way that we are creating a better overall job experience for our people. In addition, the system has built in turn-by-turn directions that will populate when the next customer is selected to help with ease and efficiency of navigating the route each day. Also when an employee is in front of the customer, the technician will have visibility to all of the services that are active with that customer. If one of our service technicians are with the customer they can more readily tell what of our other services they should offer, based on that customer\u2019s needs. This will improve our ability to increase share of wallet as well as customer retention. As our war data shows, the more services a customer has, the stickier that customer will be going forward. The customer benefits are a key to the long-term success of the project. Customers now are able to receive an e-mail of an improved service ticket as soon as the service is complete instead of the former paper version. Currently, over 50% of our customers are taking advantage of this feature. Our customer experience will improve with our ability to schedule or reschedule a follow-up appointment in the future. The updates will be sent to technician\u2019s iPhone, in some cases while the customer is still on the line. In the past, it was a very manual process and those same requests were received at our branch locations where the administrative group would have to call or text the technician to see how their day looked and then explain the change needed. This new scheduling process is much more customer friendly. One of the many financial benefits is the real-time thinking of customer service tickets and billing. This saves time from our administrative ranks no longer needing to post these services and will speed up the billing and collection cycle between one and two days. Beginning in Q3, our implementation in handheld expense for new iPhone kits were dropped dramatically. By Q4, these conversion costs will be completely eliminated. As we noted before, we are still assessing how we will address implementation of the other independent brands with this technology and we will keep you posted. With more regions now deployed, over the 12-month comparison period, we continue to see improvements in administrative overtime, customer retention both pest control and termite as well as reductions in pest control bad debt as the administrative groups are more able to concentrate on this important area of cash flow. We will continue to assess and monitor these and other areas of benefits as we continue down the maturity path of the system. In total, gross margin for the quarter improved to 52.3% versus 51.5% in the prior year. The margin for the quarter benefited from lower personnel related expense as group insurance claims were down year-over-year, lower fleet costs due to a decrease in fuel prices and service salaries as a percent of revenue with the better employee productivity. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased 7.1% totaling $12.4 million. Depreciation was $5.9 million, increasing $1.16 million with most of that increase related to our BOSS system. Amortization was $6.4 million, which increased $57,000 due to the addition of Critter Control customer contracts that will be amortized over 7 years. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $7.9 million or 6.7%, but deteriorated slightly to last year at 30.8% of revenues. Increases were in the areas of professional services, mostly due to the Safeguard acquisition and higher sales salaries needed for the increased demand and increased administrative salaries due to the accelerated BOSS implementation. As for our cash position, for the first six months ended June 30, 2016, we spent almost $36 million on our 21 acquisitions and paid out $43.7 million in dividends, which is up 25% over last year. We were active with share repurchase in the open market, purchasing a total of 419,329 shares for a total of $11,158,491. We had $19.9 million of CapEx and ended with $126 million in cash, up 15.3% from last year. Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on September 9, 2016 to the stockholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2016. This marks the 14th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% or greater. We look forward to finishing the BOSS project and to begin realizing the benefits of our investments. For our analysts and the investment community, I hope that you will mark September 20 on your calendar for our first Rollins Investor Analyst Day in New York City. I look forward to the opportunity for you to meet our top executives and learn more about our businesses. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well, Eddie and I are here to answer any questions that you might have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from the line of Jamie Clement of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Jamie Clement : Gary, Eddie, good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Jamie. Jamie Clement : Gary, when you were talking about your comments on HomeTeam, you mentioned that it had a contributing factor on the high growth rate in termite that you had during the quarter. Obviously, we know about HomeTeam. I don\u2019t recall really historically you calling out HomeTeam is being a major contributor to termite. So, have you emphasized pre-treat through them more in recent quarters or in recent year or so or is it something that\u2019s been there all along? Eddie Northen : Hey, Jamie, this is Eddie. So, I am the one who had this comment. Jamie Clement : My bad, I am sorry. Eddie Northen : That\u2019s okay. I think this is something that has been there through time. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily tremendously different as far as the overall impact. Just wanted to highlight the fact that they do continue to have substantial growth in this particular part of what they offer, especially with the new builders. The thing that\u2019s a positive there as we get a chance for that pretreatment and we are getting another opportunity to have a new customer, which has really given us an opportunity to continue to grow both on the termite and on the pest control sides. Gary Rollins : And I think the size of the builders that we represent gives us a wonderful opportunity. One of the requirements of financing and most states require that there would be a pretreatment done on new homes. So, we are handy and we are taking advantage of it. Jamie Clement : Now, Gary, with that requirement, is this sort of like does the homebuyer actually have to opt into that in some technical way or is it something where the builder just contracts with you and it\u2019s going to happen regardless of what the incoming homeowner wants once that happens? Gary Rollins : It\u2019s a builder requirement. Jamie Clement : Okay, got it. Gary Rollins : As the homeowner at the time is not a typically \u2013 is not a homeowner. Jamie Clement : Right, right. Gary Rollins : It\u2019s one of the first things that are done when a home start comes out of ground when the slab is poured is when the pretreatment is done. Jamie Clement : Got it. And just to follow-up. Eddie, with respect to the BOSS system rollout, I think you gave us the kind of the incremental depreciation expense year-over-year. In terms of operating expense both that you can quantify as well as the stuff that\u2019s a little bit less tangible, what do you think the total cost during the quarter other than depreciation related to BOSS may well have been that by let\u2019s say the fourth quarter or first half of next year will be gone from your quarterly numbers? Eddie Northen : Well, so in Q1 and Q2, we enhanced our rollout and a large part of the cost of that are the implementation teams. So, we basically in Q1 and Q2 kind of doubled up our efforts of what we have seen in previous quarters. So, we have contractors that we use for that where we actually have people at each one of the branch locations that are there as trainers that they are going through the implementation phase. So, that\u2019s a large part of the overall expense as we roll this out. And then of course, the actual iPhone kits themselves. So, again in Q1 and Q2, we are doubling up our expense and our efforts there as we are getting those rolled out and that\u2019s how we got to this total of over 5,300 total active users. Jamie Clement : Okay. Are you depreciating the \u2013 are the iPhones CapEx though or are those actually OpEx or was it a mix? Eddie Northen : Yes. So, the iPhones are OpEx, the depreciations for the system. So, the depreciation obviously will continue to build over time. And we will have that full Q3 as you move forward, but the implementation costs should be the part that will be reduced substantially in Q3 and will be eliminated in Q4 and the same thing with the iPhone kits. Jamie Clement : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Because I think I may have had that wrong, because I would assume iPhones, I assume that was actually CapEx rather than actually flowing through the P&L, so my bad on that. Anyway, thanks. Eddie Northen : Yes, okay. Jamie Clement : Anyway, thanks very much for the time, Eddie. I appreciate it. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will move to our next question from the line of Joan Tong of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Joan Tong : Good morning, Gary and Eddie. How are you guys? Gary Rollins : Good morning, Joan. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Joan Tong : So, the first question of regarding the growth rates and Gary, you mentioned the growth rate a little bit lighter in the first quarter. And if I were to ask you about the operating metrics that you always seemed to comment on that on each conference call, for example, the lead, the retention rate as well as the customer closing rates. Are those numbers, like in line with what you expected? Gary Rollins : Yes. Retention was in line with what we expected. The phenomena of the pace, I guess, everybody has got a theory. I think my theory is that Mother Nature has more to do with that than anything. We were staffed. Our advertising was going. Our digital marketing was going. I mean, there was no operational hiccup. It was just a matter of leads and demand really. Eddie Northen : Joan, if you look at the total revenue through the first two quarters and you compare back to the last three years, we are ahead of the pace of the last three years. So, I think Gary\u2019s word of lumpiness is probably the best way to look at that. Q1 obviously was strong and Q2 not quite as strong as that. But to his point, retention rate is still well in line with where we expect them to be and sales results for service lines are in line as well. Joan Tong : Okay. Because if you look at the commercial growth rate it\u2019s particularly weak, I wouldn\u2019t say weak \u2013 it seems to be growing at that 2%, 3% range. So, other than the lumpiness of the business, is there anything else like changes in competitive landscape, any specifically for that particular business line on commercial? Gary Rollins : I really don\u2019t think so. Our leads were not as strong as we like. Our commercial businesses, lot of good commercial businesses are sold in the branches and it\u2019s influenced by the leads that we get. So, you might think, first of all, that commercial shouldn\u2019t be impacted by Mother Nature, but it is and it doesn\u2019t influence the lead flow. So, that\u2019s our staffing was there, our pricing was there. We have had competition from the start. So, I don\u2019t really think that anything unique is taking place in the competitive area. That would be my take, Joan, on the situation. Eddie Northen : Yes. Joan, I think we have had good growth on the residential and on the termite side. And if you take a look at the commercial kind of like our revenue in total, if you look at our commercial year-to-date, we are higher at 3.6% than we were for the full year 2015. So, it\u2019s not growing at the same rate necessarily as the residential or the termite in this quarter, but still well in line if you look at it just from last year\u2019s number. Joan Tong : Okay, alright. That\u2019s fair. And maybe moving forward to the expenses \u2013 to the expenses questions, I mean Jamie asked about the depreciation and amortization expenses, I got it like what $12 million for this quarter, is it a good run rate, so next quarter are we going to see like a further hedge up that I assume that\u2019s the case. And that\u2019s first question. And then second question, it seems to me like your iPhone kit expenses is not done yet, so fourth quarter, I am not sure you talked about it might edge down but maybe there will be more next year, can you just elaborate on that two fronts? Eddie Northen : So let me go to your second question first. So we are 95% done with the Orkin brand at the end of the quarter. At this point in time, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are still assessing what we are going to do if anything with the other independent brands. We are going to take a look and see what makes sense from a financial perspective with the changes we would have to make to the system and then what the return would be for those independent brands. So once we get done with this work and at this point in time, we will be done with the iPhone kits as far as the add-on and again we have 5% of total Orkin left. That will be done in Q3 and we won\u2019t have any expense at all in Q4 unless we would make the decision to move forward with one of the other independent brands which of course we will share with you once we know more along those fronts. Joan Tong : Okay. Eddie Northen : And when we take a look at \u2013 if you take a look at some of those other independent brands and the reason why we are having to go through and do this assessment is because they are very different than Orkin. Some of their business models are different. Some of them are more weighted towards commercial where it may or may not be the same benefits that we would see as an overall more balanced Orkin groups. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with that analysis right now. Joan Tong : Okay. And did you disclose like what\u2019s the elevated expenses related to BOSS and that it\u2019s going to roll off in the fourth quarter, is it like a major impact on your bottom line a $1 or $2? Eddie Northen : Yes. We didn\u2019t break that out. But I think we are going to be along the same lines of what we saw a year ago when we talked about what the impact was for the entire year. So if you think about what we talked about as far as entire year, we finished everything off through the first two quarters. And then we will go through from there and be able to have virtually nothing in the fourth quarter and much less in the third quarter. The implementation piece is a big piece. It\u2019s going to go away. And we won\u2019t need as many developers to be able to help with the changes that we had to make as we have been rolling this out. So those are all going to be pieces they are going to go into that. Joan Tong : Okay, great. Alright. Thank you. And then maybe talk a little bit about the UK pest control landscape, is it your first acquisition in that area, so I assume that like you are \u2013 we will continue on like making effort there in terms of expanding that region, just like how you did that in Canada years ago and then like in Australia. And so can you just maybe talk about like how the competitive landscape like we know that there is a sizable competitors on the top, but is it also pretty fragmented at the bottom? Eddie Northen : It is. It\u2019s very fragmented. I am not sure if it\u2019s to the same exact degree that we have in the U.S., but it\u2019s a very, very fragmented market. And I think we are just going to have this be another one of the opportunity areas that we look at as we are looking at the best way to deploy our cash from an acquisition perspective, as we look around the world. Gary Rollins : Joan, there is another advantage to this acquisition. We really want an international model branch to show our franchise owners and potential owners. I mean now they come over to the U.S. and they visit our commercial operations typically in our residential. And they are just not the same that that independent owner really has to model his business after. So one of the pluses, I think that we are going to get is we are going to have a model operation that they can get a better sense of really how to get organized and how to conduct their business. Joan Tong : Alright. Thank you, guys. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thanks Joan. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from the line of Sean Kennedy of Nomura. Please go ahead. Sean Kennedy : Good morning Gary and Eddie. Thanks for taking my questions. Eddie Northen : Good morning Sean. Sean Kennedy : Eddie, you mentioned the way BOSS has affected the business so far, but have you identified any new opportunities related to BOSS as it becomes more mature? Eddie Northen : Well, I think when we first looked at BOSS over 2 years ago, they were I am sure a few things that came to everyone\u2019s mind that would be able to benefits to make this, make sense. And I think as we roll, I think a few different things. I think the role of the administrative team and the branches is going to be completely different. We knew they were going to tasks that we are going to be eliminated which had been eliminated. But I think to the degree of how we foresee them being, we are really going to be change that branch administrative person now to become much more customer focused. We are seeing that in the retention rates that I mentioned earlier. I talked about specific numbers on last quarter, but I talked about just in general we continue to see our pest control and our termite control retention numbers continue to get better. And I think those branch service folks as well as service technicians are all going to be able to improve that customer experience, which is going to help us with our retention. And anything that we can do to spend more time with the customer is going to do nothing, but help us with our existing customers and as far as growing our customer base. I think that\u2019s one area. We have talked in previous calls about the routing and scheduling. I don\u2019t know if that was on our radar to the degree that it is today with this virtual route manager as a bolt-on. So I think those are couple of areas that are going to be a key to us as we are moving forward. But the bottom line is, anything we can do to make that customer experience better, we are just going to be better for it and we think both of those pieces are going to enable us to be able to do that. Sean Kennedy : Great, got it. And just won more question, one of your competitors just announced collaboration with Google to develop an Internet of Things for pest control like applying Big Data and predictive analytics to pest control, how do you think it will impact the industry and are you engaged with similar developments at Rollins? Gary Rollins : Well, I can tell you that our marketing group has been really involved with the data analytics piece for probably in the last 2-plus years now, breaking everything down in all the different service lines and taking a look at all the different factors that go into retaining customers, growing customers, customer segments, customer segments by income, by geography, by our different independent brands. And that\u2019s a lot of what they use when we go through and we make our decisions on how we advertise, how we price, how we go through and make the decision on what, where we want to spend our management resources as well as our capital to be able to go through and grow our business. So I am not familiar with the specifics of what you are talking about with the competitor, but I do know that our internal marketing group from my perspective has done a tremendous job with that and helping the guidance as we continue to move forward. Sean Kennedy : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Gary Rollins : Does that answer your question, Sean? Sean Kennedy : Okay, that\u2019s it. Thanks. Gary Rollins : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up question from the line of Jamie Clement of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Jamie Clement : Hey, Gary and Eddie. Just want to follow-up. I would assume this question would have come up already, but it hasn\u2019t, I did want to ask you about the mosquito business this summer obviously with the serious Zika virus concerns that are out there? Gary Rollins : Okay. You just want general kind of... Jamie Clement : Yes. Just your general thoughts like I mean I know that\u2019s obviously historically pretty small part of your business, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s been the equivalent of bedbugs from a couple of years ago to your industry, but I would imagine in certain areas of country you probably get more phone calls? Gary Rollins : Yes. I think that\u2019s a very serious assessment. We absolutely are. We are getting more phone calls and we are having more opportunities in lot of areas, areas that you would expect we are probably seeing more. So we saw growth in Florida earlier, because they are going to have much demand than we would see in other parts of the country. If you take a look at a very, very small base that we have, sales in a lot of areas have grown tremendously. I mean they have doubled in some areas as far as mosquito growth, but again, small base. That\u2019s the phenomena and as you know, it\u2019s something that built over time. Year one was big growth. But I am not sure that anybody knew that it was going to be 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years phenomenon. And we are kind of in it\u2019s year one right now from the Zika perspective of the mosquito. So we will continue to \u2013 we want to continue to make sure that we are playing the right role in this. We want to make sure that we are educating the community to make sure the people know and understand what they can do to be able to help reduce or eliminate the concerns they have. And if they need professional help, we actually want to be the ones to be able to help them in that perspective. But we also have a benefit of marketing our other services. I mean we may get a mosquito call, but we have an opportunity to have a recurring pest control customer. And then we also have an opportunity, we have a termite customer. So in addition to the revenue that it generates directly, there is revenue that\u2019s generated indirectly. Jamie Clement : Now Gary, I wanted to ask it doesn\u2019t seem to me that the industry has historically done much advertising on regarding mosquito service and I have this feeling and maybe I m totally off base here, but that the technology that you guys can bring to bear the treatment protocols and then maybe even the chemicals are a lot better than they were 15 years ago, I just have this feeling that Americans kind of doubt whether your mosquito treatments or the industry\u2019s mosquito treatments really work all that well, do you think there is a disconnect here and maybe an opportunity over the next couple years to push the service? Gary Rollins : Well, we obviously we think our service is better. We do mystery shopping where we see what the competitors are doing. And there are several things that we do that in addition to what\u2019s done. I believe as long as this Zika situation stays covered as far as the press is concerned, it generates a lot of mosquito business and that mosquito customers are really happy. I have been in this business for five decades and I never had a service that people will stop to you, talk to you at cocktail parties. I mean they are very excited about the fact that they get their back yard return to them. Eddie Northen : Jamie, from the advertising perspective remember not everywhere in the U.S. has mosquito demand. It\u2019s only in certain areas. I mean everybody has ants, everybody has cockroaches, everybody has other stuff, not everybody has mosquito. To Gary\u2019s point, that he just made I am the personal mosquito customer of ours. And I have lived in this out for many, many, many years and I tried every other off the shelf product that was out there. And it does not hold the candle to this mosquito service. I mean you actually do reclaim your yard at that point of time is that something you are trying to do. And the stats are behind it. I mean it\u2019s our best retention product that we have it over 95%. Gary Rollins : And I think that the environmental concerns that the consumer has really sets us apart from Joe in his pickup truck and the fogging machine. And as Eddie said, we have \u2013 on the Internet, we have quite a few spikes where we really explain to the homeowner what they can do, how they can eliminate mosquito trap. Jamie Clement : Okay. I appreciate that additional color a lot. Thank you all very much. Gary Rollins : Thanks Jamie. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay, I guess that\u2019s it. And we want to thank you for being here. We look forward to reporting in the third quarter. I think we will know more about BOSS at that time because we have another quarter under our belt and branches getting more material. And we look forward to it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are pleased to report that we maintained our pace of generating record revenue and earnings results. The third quarter marked our 42nd quarter of improvement. Revenue grew 6.1% to approximately $424 million, compared to almost $400 million in last year's third quarter. Income before taxes increased 10.4% to approximately $80 million, compared to $72.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. Net income rose 10.2% to $49.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $45 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Revenues for the first nine months increased 5.8% to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Net income rose 7.4% to approximately $129.4 million, with earnings per share of $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $120.4 million, or $0.55 per diluted share for the prior period. All of our business lines experienced good growth during the quarter with residential pest control up 7%; commercial pest control grew 4.9%; while termite increased 7.2%. Eddie will provide more detail on these numbers in a few minutes. Last month we are privilege to have hosted Rollins Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange. It was a wonderful day for members of our senior management team to interact with analysts and investors that follow Rollins. Nine key members of our team enjoyed sharing their fields of expertise and providing greater depth on what is occurring in their area of responsibility. We feel that all involved gained significantly from this experience. It was hard to believe that year-end is rapidly approaching and reflecting on this in our meeting in New York, I\u2019m once again reminded of what a great company we have, great customers and great employees. I realized that I'm a little biased however. The following is a quote attributed to me recently in one of the trade magazines. For me, it summarizes why we have a great company. \u201cIf someone ask you what Rollins most important assets are, you would probably answer, our people and our customers\u201d. That's a no-brainer. I would add our culture as number three. You see, I believe that a strong positive and enduring culture is critical to a company\u2019s success. The mantra of our culture is continuous improvement. As I've said numerous times, we all know we can do better. There is not one aspect of our business that we don\u2019t think we can improve, and we all subscribe to that every day, not just in corporate headquarters but around the globe. In August, ahead of schedule, we completed our rollout of BOSS to Orkin\u2019s 400 U.S. locations. We now have an excess of 7,000 pest control and termite control iPhone-equipped service technicians. Our new system is allowing us to communicate at many touch points with our customers, thus improving the customer experience. Our Orkin technicians and employees have a tool now that helps them to do a better job. As a result, we believe that this technology will ultimately lead to improve customer and employee retention. We've referred to BOSS in the past as a game-changer, and we believe that we're just scratching the surface of what will enable us to do as we continue to build our business. One good example of one of these new features is our latest addition to BOSS. The enhanced route management and scheduling tool, Virtual Route Management, or we refer to it as VRM. It allows us to better organize our technicians day and week in the most efficient manner. Further, it will provide our service personnel the ability to reduce miles driven, have fewer fuel stops, and reduce windshield time. Less drive time translates to a better customer experience with more time available to be with an existing customer or new customer just starting our service. Eddie is going to provide you more details on VRM in a few minutes as well. Another great thing about having our 7,000 plus technicians onto an iPhone is it is enabling them to reduce their paperwork. This also enables them to engage more fully with the customer. Our latest phone app called Scalp [ph] is an excellent example of how we are working to provide our technicians with the tools they need to further enhance our customers\u2019 experience. Scalp [ph] provides a collection of Orkin services and pest information available on the technician's mobile device. As good as our technicians are, their occasionally comes a time when they encounter a pests or something in doing a service treatment they haven't experienced. A good example what we call an occasional invader would be nematodes in a pantry. No problem, the technician goes to Scalp [ph] and pulls up a quick video that shows the eight steps necessary to take care of those pest problem. Technicians are the face of our brand every day. And by empowering them to deliver better customer service, we are enhancing their expertise and earnings, and the ultimate result in better customer relationship. This is just one of the benefits of Scalp [ph]. As Eddie mentioned last quarter, we are still assessing how we will address and prioritize implementation of BOSS technology at our independent brands. We'll keep you posted on this. I want to personally acknowledge and thank all the members of our IT and operations team that contributed so much to the successful conversion. During the quarter, we continue to expand our global presence having acquired Scientific Pest Management in Australia. Scientific provides pest control services through owned and franchise partnered companies. The company offers both commercial pest control and termite service, specializing in large contracts. This acquisition gives our Robbins brands\u2019 nationwide coverage and now positions us as of the third largest pest control company in Australia. We also added to our international franchise portfolio having created five new franchises in South America and Asia. Year-to-date, we have established a total of eight new international franchise or today a total of 56 international franchises. Incidentally we also have 50 U.S. franchises. One aspect of our acquisition strategy is our purchase of Critter Control franchises. Our priority for wildlife expansion is to assess the top Critter Control markets in the U.S. and match them up where we have existing to Trutech operations. We then will make a strategic decision on whether we combine our efforts or not. Year-to-date we have purchased 10 franchises. We have identified a list of target markets, and when the opportunity arises, we will methodically expand this program. In the meantime, we still have our company-owned locations to operate under our brand of Trutech. I want to give a big happy birthday shout to HomeTeam, which is celebrating its 20th birthday this year. Over the years, HomeTeam has grown from 13 branches and 180 employees to 50 branches and 1,600 team members. And if that isn't enough to celebrate, let me share one more milestone, we\u2019re just days away from HomeTeam completing their one million installations. Happy 20th. Thank you HomeTeam, we appreciate your contributions to our company. The next time we speak of 2017 as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we think we have a great company for which we are most thankful. We believe that we\u2019ll end the year having accomplished our financial plans and goals. We are thankful for our customers, employees and stakeholders that have been a part of these accomplishments. With that said, I'll turn the call over to you Eddie. Eddie? Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. I would also like to say thank you to those of you that were able to spend some time with us at our recent Investor Day in New York City. The time enabled us to highlight our greatest asset, our people. On September 20, we introduced our top executives to a group of investors and leading analysts at the New York Stock Exchange. While tests the bed bug sniffing dog almost stole the show, we were able to share the depth and breadth of our management team that is helping to lead this great company. I recently attended a luncheon where a local university professor gave an economic update that shared that as a nation, we are in the 88th month of the economic expansion, and Rollins has exceeded that record of growth with our equivalent of 126 month of growth and improved earnings results. We had a solid 6.1% revenue growth and return to our historical double-digit net income growth at 10.2%. I also want to express my thanks to our IT team for an incredible job rolling out arguably, the most complex project in our company's history. Each of our service line showed sustained growth and key to the quarter included continued strong residential termite and ancillary revenue gains, the largest commercial gain in the past seven quarters and enhanced margin expansion even with the cost for the completion of the Orkin BOSS rollout. Looking at the numbers, the company reported third quarter revenues of $424 million, again an increase of 6.1% over the prior-year's third quarter revenue of $399.7 million. While we do have lumpiness in our quarters, as we had discussed, our nine-month revenue growth is the best in the past five years. For the quarter, income before income taxes increased 10.4% to $80 million. Our foreign taxes were a bit higher than last year due to the growth in our foreign operations, and as a result, net income increased 10.2% to $49.7 million with earnings per share up 9.5% to $0.23 versus $0.21 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. As I mentioned, our results were positively impacted by the very early operational benefit of our investments. Even with the historically high additional BOSS expense pushed into the first two quarters of the year, our year-to-date net margin has expanded 10 basis points. However for the third quarter, the net margin has jumped to an expansion of 50 basis points, which we are very pleased to see. For the first nine months, our revenue grew 5.8% from $1.1 billion in 2015 to $1.2 billion in 2016. Income before income tax grew 8.7% from $191.4 million in 2015 to $208.1 million in 2016. Net income grew 7.4% from $120.4 million in 2015 to $129.4 million in 2016. As I just mentioned, our early operational improvements positively impacted our results. Let's go through an update of how BOSS can potentially impact our future. With roughly half of our branches reaching maturity at some time during the quarter, we are getting more clarity on operational and business improvements related to the technology and we are extremely encouraged. During our Q1 earnings call, we gave an update on some areas where we were seeing some quantifiable improvements, and I want to update these results. While we still have roughly half of our branches that need to move to maturity, we have seen a double-digit reduction in administrative over time, customer pest control retention improved slightly, termite retention improved by mid-single digits, and we believe that our termite renewal improvement is due to more attention spend on the customer and less on administrative tasks. Miles per customer service decreased by low-double digits with the help of turn-by-turn directions given to the technicians. I should point out we have not seen significant impact yet by the rollout of our Virtual Route Management system. In these mature branches, we experienced a greater than 25% improvement in pest control bad debt as the administrative groups were able to concentrate more on collections. We are guardedly optimistic about these results. However we need to have a lot more data before we celebrate. Now that our Orkin operations have finished their rollout, we are prioritizing improvements to enhance functionality of BOSS. One of the first improvements that was added in the quarter was the BOSS iPhone functionality for all of our termite technicians. Up until a couple of months ago, they were still doing everything manually on paper tickets and the posting was still done the next day by branch administrative staff. They are now on iPhone, so all termite technicians are now like our pest control technicians and have paperless and real-time posting capabilities. There will be more updates on our progress to share in future quarters. Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the quarter. Our total revenue increased 6.1%, which included eight-tenths per percent from acquisitions and the remaining 5.3% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control was up which made up 43% of our revenue was up a solid 7%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 4.9%, and termite an ancillary services, which made up approximately 16% of our revenue was up a strong 7.2%. During the quarter, we acquired Scientific Pest Control Company in Australia, which made a slight improvement on our commercial and termite businesses. Again total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.3%, from that residential was up 6.9%; commercial was up 3.6%; and termite was up 5.5%. When you take a look at our domestic revenues for the quarter, in total we grew 5.7%; residential grew 6.9%; termite was up 5.7%; and commercial pest control was up 4.4%. Commercial and termite were most impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollars, as most of our business in these countries is commercial. We are now into our sixth year of tracking the impact of bed bug revenue. Our four-legged friend test at Western Pest Control has assigned bed bug duty at only one of our brands, but most of our independent brands and Orkin provides bed bug services. For the quarter, bed bug grew 9.5%, and for the year, bed bug revenue is up over 10%. As experience has increased, we have improved our profitability, and just as importantly, our recurring revenue in this area. Another milestone during the quarter and a byproduct of rolling out BOSS was the completion of training on the Virtual Route Management system that Gary mentioned. This add-on to BOSS has the potential to give us further improvements in the routing and scheduling of our technicians. The program takes the planned work of the technician and optimizes the route travel while addressing known customer request for specific service times. When we first rolled this out to our branches in June, less than 10% of our routes were optimized, and as of September, over 50% of all routes are now being optimized each day. The effectiveness of this new tool will continue to improve in the future. This optimization has a couple of large benefits. First, it gives more structure to the technician today, which enables them to concentrate more on the customer and not the logistics of the day. Second, and arguably more importantly, will enable us to better meet our appointments for customers that have requested service time. The optimizer calculates the time of each service and travel time between the services to better ensure arriving during the committed service window. Our technicians will have more time to concentrate on pest services and less on travel. In total, gross margins for the quarter increased to 51.5% versus 51.1% for the prior year. The margin for the quarter benefited from improved efficiencies that I discussed in routing and scheduling and improved technician productivity that helped to lower salaries as a percent of revenue. The improved pest control technician productivity contributed to a reduction in fleet expenses. Personnel-related expenses were down as a percent of revenue as group insurance and auto liability expenses were down quarter-over-quarter. This was offset by an increase in maintenance agreements and software costs related to BOSS. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $1.9 million to $13.1 million, an increase of 17.3%. Depreciation was $6.5 million, increasing $1.6 million with most of that increase related to our BOSS software, iPhone and printer depreciation. Amortization was $6.6 million, which increased $362,000 with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts of the acquisition of Murray Pest Control and Scientific Pest Control in Australia. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $3.5 million or 2.8% to 29.6% of revenues, down nine-tenth of a percent from 30.5% for the third quarter last year. The decrease in the percentage of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries and over time as a percent of revenues, which has been helped by the BOSS implementation. Personnel-related expenses were lower as group insurance expense was down and telephone costs reduced as we saw decreases with the change of data service providers. As for our cash position for the first nine months ended September 30, 2016, we spent almost $41 million, up 30.1% year-over-year on acquisitions and paid out $65.5 million in dividends, which is up 25% over last year. We were active with share repurchase in the open market purchasing a total of 835,559,000 shares for a total of $22,718,000. We had $27.1 million of capital expenditures and ended with $139 million in cash, up 3.7% from last year. Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share both to be paid on December 9, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2016. This marks the 14th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by minimum of 12% or greater. We are positioned to finish the year on a strong note and I'm looking forward to reporting a good finish to 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Mary, John and I will be happy to answer any questions that you all might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Joan Tong : Hi Gary, Eddie and John. How are you guys? Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Doing well. Joan Tong : Good. I have a bunch of questions here. First off, just want to ask about the BOSS system. Thank you for all the update in terms of the operating improvement metrics. It's really helpful. And with the BOSS system implementation completed and you are now focusing in enhancing functionality and then also like Virtual Route Management looks really encouraging. So I'm just wondering like going into next year, how should we think about any incremental spending in technology, if there is any? Eddie Northen : Yes, so Joan thanks for that. As we talked when we were at the Analyst Day, our anticipation at this point in time is to return to the historical norm that we\u2019ve seen. On that day the graph that we showed went back to 2008 and showed our much higher capital expenditures spend when we opened up our call center. And then that graph kind of fast-forwarded through time. You saw kind of the historical norm of capital expenditure spend. Then you saw a spike obviously in 2015 and \u201816 with the BOSS rollout. And we anticipate it returning back to that historical norm. And again as we move forward and if we see anything that's going to be material in nature, we will communicate that ahead of time as far as anything that would deviate from that historical norm. Joan Tong : Okay. Got it. And then for the Virtual Route Management, you talked about that functionality actually improve or optimize 50% of the route. Is there a reason why the rest is not being optimized or you\u2019re just kind of still in the middle of rolling that out to all your Orkin brands? John Wilson : Yes, so we've gone through the training for all the Orkin brands and now it's a matter of having this become part of the daily routine of what they go through and do. So each branch we are going through and as follow-up training is needed then will continue to do that to make sure that we are maximizing opportunities as quickly as we can. Just like with anything, you have very early adopters and you have others that take a little bit more time to be able to make a change. So this is a relatively material change in the life of a branch where we are having to have routes that are adjusted and changed. And probably most importantly, we have to make sure that we have all of the customer-related service times that need to be locked in that all of those are accounted for. So we want to make sure that as we are going through and we are optimizing that all of that is taken care of. And I think we've had good improvement since the beginning to get over the 50% number and we'll continue to move that forward. Gary Rollins : Joan, we also have the ability to know whose is using and who is not. But the great thing is the excitement that the branches are going through is that we haven't had to poke anybody, but do have the ability to know where we stand in every branch. Joan Tong : Got it. I see. Thanks for the update. And maybe you guys can talk a little bit about the lead activities or the operating metrics? And if I recall correctly in the second quarter there was some sort of softness in the lead generation on lead closure, and just want to see if that has improved? And also I have follow-up on Critter Control. John Wilson : Okay. So Joan if it\u2019s okay, we'll answer this one and then we\u2019ll move on and let someone else get in the queue and please come back into the queue if that's okay with you. But as far as lead generation is concerned, all of our different areas, our termite control, our commercial and our residential, all are a little bit different states, but they are all in the single digits as far as our lead control to low-double digits. So we see lead enhancements continuing to be healthy in all of the different areas and we'll see - we think that we\u2019ll see sales that will continue to move along based on that as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go next to Sean Kennedy with Nomura. Your line is open. Sean Kennedy : Hi, good morning guys. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Sean. Sean Kennedy : I was wondering if you could give an update on the size in terms of the revenue of HomeTeam, and also it's grown at install base about little over 10% since \u201807. I was wondering if you could sort of moving trends recently, if it\u2019s accelerating or decelerating from that number? Eddie Northen : Yes, so Sean we don't break out the size of HomeTeam at this point in time. We continue to see very positive trends and on previous calls I've given some specifics both the installation improvements as well as the actual revenue improvements. We see HomeTeam growing regularly faster than our total company growth rates, so that's a very positive thing for us. And as we continue to improve on the installations, as Gary mentioned in his remarks, it just gives us that many more opportunities to be able to have potential new customers through time. So all good things from HomeTeam and we\u2019ll continue intermittently giving updates as far as specifics are concerned, but nothing really noticeable to necessarily report outside of the good results that we\u2019ve talked about in previous calls. Sean Kennedy : Got it. And are you able to give the active customer count? Eddie Northen : We are not. Sean Kennedy : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Great quarter. Gary Rollins : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll pause for a moment to allow further questions to queue. Gary Rollins : No more questions? Operator : We do have a follow-up from Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Joan Tong : Hi. Yes, the follow-up is regarding Critter Control. It seems like it\u2019s a very nice growth area, and then Gary you touched on that a little bit on your prepared remarks. Can you just like remind us the economics in terms of the benefits of folding that back in or buying back the Critter Control franchisees, and also when you're reaching out to those franchisees just want to see what type of feedback you got from those proposal? Gary Rollins : Well, the well-run Critter Control branches have certainly good margins. I mean some of them are better than some of our pest control margins. It's really a great fit for us. Critter Control was the number one brand in the market. We've already seeing big jumps in leads when we updated their internet coverage. They've not been very aggressive in that way and we can benefit from what we've learned from our pest control side. So we are excited. I mean, we - these folks have really never had a buyer per se. The guy that found Critter Control really all he wanted was to have franchises, so I think they have approximately 200. Eddie Northen : For the franchise? Gary Rollins : Yes. Eddie Northen : So about 200. Gary Rollins : Yes, so there is 200 franchises, so it's not insignificant. We just think it's a great fit and we also know how to do it. I mean with our Trutech operation, we've had a very good success. And so this is not really getting into something that we are not familiar with. So we're very optimistic about it. John Wilson : Yes, so Joan since we bought some of those back where, I guess, we're little low over 100 now as far as the total franchises are concerned after we bought some of these back. And of course we bought the master franchise or we had the royalty fees that we were receiving. And to Gary's point, now in these key markets we're able to roll that brand name and the customer base into our existing wildlife operations and we are able to see some very good opportunities by combining those efforts together. And it took us a little while. We purchased them I think February of last year, and we\u2019ve worked through all the economics of it to make sure that we started this correctly when we started the buyback. So it took us almost 10 months before we bought the first one back, so we wanted to make sure that it was done correctly in the right markets for the right price. So now that we have that down, we've been able to go through and get that process started and it's been very positive results for us so far. Joan Tong : Thank you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Joan. Operator : And this does conclude our Q&A for today. I'd like to turn the call back to our presenters for any closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and year-end results on our next call. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we will begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statements we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are extremely pleased to the posted record results for the quarter as well as our nineteen consecutive years of improved revenues and profits. For the quarter revenue increased 6.4% to $385.6 million compared to $362.5 million in last year's fourth quarter. Net income 19.7% to $38 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to net income of $31.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the full year increased 5.9% to $1.573 billion compared to $1.485 billion for the same period last year. Incidentally, the 5.9% increase was the greatest percent increase since 2010. Income before income taxes grew 7.2% to $260.6 million compared to $243.2 million in prior year. Net income rose 10% to $167.4 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.77 compared to $152.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year. All of our business lines experienced growth during the quarter with residential pest control up 7.9%, commercial pest control grew 5.5% and termite rose 5.7%. We're also pleased with the growth experienced by our specialty brands and international and wildlife brands all of which reported impressive growth for the year. As stated previously I believe it bears repeating that we think the results underscore the value that we are experiencing in selectively acquiring market leading specialty pest control and wildlife companies. At the same time our ancillary businesses although are relatively small part of our total business continued to perform well. Bed bugs have certainly not going away, although we believe we'll experience a slower growth rate in this business going forward. Earlier this month we released Orkin's Top 50 bed bug cities based on services provided this past year in the leading U.S. metro markets. While these 50 cities have the most treatments last year our Orkin technicians treated for bed bugs in all 50 states as well as internationally. This past year our bed bug revenue increased 10% over the last year. We also experienced growth in our mosquito business. As we have discussed in the past, mosquito borne diseases continue to be an increasing threat around the world. We continue to provide educational materials on the precautions that can be taken to protect against mosquito bites, infestations, and how mosquito populations can be controlled. Revenues for our mosquito business increased over 20% this past year. We continue to make inroads in expanding Orkin's brand recognition to growing our international presence this past year, both through Orkin's expansion in Australia and our entry into the United Kingdom. Also as announced earlier this month in the last quarter of the year we created 17 new international franchises, 12 of these franchises are located in China while the other five are located in Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Malaysia and the Kingdom of Cambodia. All of these franchises will offer commercial and residential pest control, as well as termite services as applicable. With the addition of these new franchises we now have established Orkin's presence in 45 countries through 70 international franchises. Our international expansion is an excellent example of our culture of continuous improvement or in this case continuous expansion. A core element of our culture is a deep commitment to build long-term relationships with our customers based on our quality of service. One means of how we accomplish this is our Listen360 customer feedback surveys where we generate thousands of customer e-mails surveys daily for each of our 600 plus province locations. To enable us to obtain real-time feedback on how our customers view what we're doing, Listen360 organizes customer feedback into three categories; promoters, customers who would recommend us to family and friends; passives, who are neutral; and detractors, those with negative feedback. These scores and rankings by location are shared throughout the company and our people take them very seriously. We are committed to turn any customer with a negative survey to become a promoter and we respond accordingly. Our survey results are provided monthly and we closely monitor our progress from the latest survey results to previous survey findings. We're pleased that in three years that we've had the Listen360 program in place that we've made improvements of over 20% from the positive scores which translate into better customer retention and customer referrals. Our objective is to have over 85% positive promoter's scores and retention of customers for all of our brands. We have a number of operations that are at 85% or better now and are striving to expand that number. As Jerry Gahlhoff, our President in Specialty Brands and the pioneer of this programs has stated, the feedback we get, both good and bad keeps us humbled about our service and focused on ways to improve the customer's experience. We can see exactly what and where our successes and failures are so we can build on our trial and improve on our shortcomings. To further help ensure that we provide the best customer experience as we grow our business we continue to make it a key objective across organization to identify and hire the best employees. We bring them along through our extensive and award winning training, thereby providing them the opportunity to build a satisfying and rewarding career at Rollins. 2016 was a momentous year for our company, one in which employees in North America and around the globe continued to advance our mission to be the best service company in the world. We're even more excited about our prospects for the New Year and beyond. We will continue to make strategic acquisitions that meet our criteria as well as expanding international and domestic franchise. At the same time will be benefiting from the investments we've made, specifically BOSS, our new brand CRM and operating system. BOSS's primary objective is to enable us to improve our customer's experience for the benefit of all of our constituencies. We look forward to sharing our progress with all of you throughout the year. I'll now turn the call over to Eddie who will provide you with more details on our financial results. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Gary. 2016 was another incredible year on a lot of fronts which included record-setting financial results during a time of significant change. We successfully wrapped up our CRM BOSS and virtual route management rollouts made several acquisitions, both, inside and outside of the U.S. and made promotional changes in our executive ranks. I cannot be more proud of our sales, operations and support teams for their resiliency during 2016 and their ability to produce these results. Each of our service lines showed the sustained growth and key to the quarter included the best growth rates since 2010, cost savings based on safety improvements and a reduction in medical claims and continued maturity of our new technology and the operations. Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million, an increase of 6.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter's revenue of $362.5 million. Before I go through the income results, I want to bring you up-to-date on a change we've made in Canada concerning tax planning. In 2004, Kinro Investments was created as part of Rollin's tax planning strategy. However, recent changes in Canadian Tax Law eliminated the benefit of this strategy and we dissolved Kinro before the end of 2016. As a result a one-time withholding tax expense had to be recognized. This expense which reduced income-before-tax by approximately $9 million was offset by a tax credit of approximately the same amount. Have we not removed Kinro from Canadian taxation, the company would pay approximately an additional $100 million of taxes over the next ten years. Rollins after-tax income and earnings per share for 2016 were not affected by the dissolving of Kinro. For the quarter the pre-tax margin of 13.6 would have been 16.0 without the one-time withholding tax expense, an 11.9% improvement over 2015. As a result for the quarter, income before income taxes only increased 1.4% to $52.5 million, net income was not impacted by the tax charge and increased 19.7% to $38 million with earnings per share of 13.3% to $0.17 versus $0.15 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. Our operations performed very well through the quarter but as an organization we also received the benefit of lower personal related expense, primarily healthcare and casualty cost due to improved safety results. At the beginning of 2016, we restructured our risk and our safety groups and are benefiting from those changes. Outside of the cost savings, we believe our improved safety in the area of accidents and injuries will create other opportunities such as improved customer experience with fewer absences of our technicians, less negative impact to the brand and the P&L through decreasing vehicle damage. Additionally, we saw a reduction in personnel related expense, primarily healthcare as we experienced fewer claims than expected during the year. Both of these items are encouraging but as we continue to mature on our virtual route management path, we also know that reduced miles will further help us with our safety and casualty expense. Let me expand a little about the early positive operational results of our BOSS and VRM investments. Even with the historically high conversion and training expense pushed into the first two quarters of the year, our year-to-date net margin has expanded 70 basis points. However, the Q4 taking out the impact of the tax withholdings, the net margin improved a 140 basis points which we were pleased to see partially as a result of our related gains from BOSS and VRMs, also included in this improvement or gains in our casualty and healthcare expenses as I mentioned earlier. As you may recall, January is the month of our annual leadership meeting where our Top 100 leaders throughout North America come together in Atlanta to recap 2016 and get the New Year kicked off. With all of the Orkin branches now on BOSS and VRM, we were able to take quality time to discuss pest control route management best practices and align our priorities for the Orkin operations related to the customer with the use of this technology. For the twelve months, our revenue grew 5.9% or $1.485 billion in 2015 to $1.573 billion in 2016. Income before income tax grew 7.2% from $243.2 million in 2015 to $260.6 million in 2016. Net income grew 10% from $152.1 million in 2015 to $167.4 million in 2016. Again, as I explained the full year income before taxes was impacted by our one-time tax charge to dissolve Kinro and net income and earnings per share were not negatively affected. Let's take a look at revenue and revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6.4% for the quarter included 1.2% from major acquisitions and the remaining 5.2% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control which made up 42% of our revenue was up very strong 7.9%. Commercial pest control which made up 41% of our revenue was up 5.5% and termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 17% of our revenue was up 5.7%. Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 5.2% and from that residential was up 7.7%, commercial was up 3.7% and termite was up 3.9%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 5.4%, residential grew 7.8%, commercial pest control was up 3.7% and termite was up 4.2%. Commercial and termite were most impacted by that weak Canadians and Australians dollars as most of our business in these countries is commercial. When looking at revenue and its service lines for the full year, our total revenue increased 5.9% and included seven-tenth of a percent from acquisitions and the remaining 5.2% was from pricing in organic growth. In total, residential pest control was up 7.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.4%, and termite and ancillary services was up 6.3%. For the full year total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.2%, from that residential was up 7.2%, commercial was up 3.5% and termite was up 4.8%. When you take out the impact of foreign currency for the year, in total, we grew 5.8%, residential grew 7.2%, commercial pest control was up 4.7% and termite was up 5.1%. Many of you have inquired about our mosquito business and even though this is still a relatively small base of revenue compared to our total. As Gary mentioned, we grew well for the quarter and for the year. When we look back over the past five years, we've grown in the mid-teens range. However we have not and will not market in a way that will be perceived to prey on public fear related to well-known Zika and what's now [ph] virus transmission. Our marketing team will continue to explore ways to solicit and provide this service to our existing customer base. At extremely high retention rate, the benefits of the service speak for themselves from a quality of life safety perspective. We look forward to continued positive results in this area. In total, gross margin for the quarter increased to 50.0% versus 49.7% in the prior year. The margin for the quarter benefited from improved efficiencies and pest control customer routing and scheduling, increased technician productivity and reduced miles driven. Additionally, personnel related expenses were down as a percent of revenue as group health insurance and auto liability expenses were down quarter over quarter. This was all set by an increase in maintenance agreements and software costs related to BOSS  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the fourth quarter increased $2.5 million to $13.8 million an increase of 21.9%. Depreciation with $6.9 million increasing $1.8 million with most of the increase related to our BOSS software, iPhone and printer depreciation. Amortization was $6.9 million which increase $648,000 with amortization of intangibles asset increasing due mostly to amortize customer contracts of the acquisition of Murray pest control, scientific pest control in Australia, as well as various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $8.7 million or 7.4% to 32.8% of revenues up, four-tenth of a percentage point from 32.4% for the fourth quarter last year, the increase in the percent of revenue is due mostly to our one-time tax event to dissolve Kinro which impacted us for the quarter by $9 million and increased SG&A by two percentage points. This was partly offset by the lower administrator\u2019s salaries and over time as a percentage of revenue, which is then helped by the BOSS implementation. Personnel related expenses as prove insurance expensive down and telephone call as we call it decreases with a change of data service provider. As for a cash position for the full month ended December 31, 2016. We spent over 46 million over acquisition, of 38.4% year-over-year and included the charges that the change of our special dividend, were total of $109 million paid in dividends, which is up 18.8% over the last year. We were active with share repurchase in the open market during the year, but not in Q4 and purchased for the year a total of 835,559 shares for $22.7 million. We had $33.1 million capital expenditures, and ended with $143 million cash up 5.7% from last year. Last night the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.115 per share that will be paid March 10, 2017 stockholders of record that close the business February 10, 2017. The cash dividend is at 15% increase over the prior year, this marks fifteenth consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% or greater. We\u2019re encouraged with the results of 2016 and look forward to 2017. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well Eddie, John and I are happy to answer your questions, I'm glad to proceed forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital, please go ahead your line is open. Joe Box : Hey, good morning everyone. So just from a high level, obviously 2016 was the strongest growth rate that we seem since 2010. I'm curious your thoughts as we get into 2017 X the 1.2% from acquisitions that you had and actually that might just been for the quarter, but X the M&A, I mean do you think that these are sustainable growth levels or should we expect some level of moderation as we finalize our models. John Wilson : So Joe, I will take that, this is John Wilson. That\u2019s sort of our plan is for them to be sustainable. We don't start any of our years without -- without our plans to get better. We maintain a continuous improvement mindset. So our plan, we think there's sample opportunity out there to continue growing our free service lines of business, they we have. Joe Box : Okay, and I guess I'm just a follow up on that then. You called out bed bugs is theoretically growing at a lower rate and I guess that's just a small component of your business, but if you look at a lot of the other big drivers for your business, where there be the home team deployments or Mosquito deployment. Are there any kind of big one-time drivers that you might not step up in 2017 anything that we should just be aware of. John Wilson : I don't know of any single one-time driver. Eddie mentioned and Gary did too about our mosquito business our bed bug business. They are both growing faster than our -- than our regular service lines but they are -- they are not that large. So I don't know of any single thing. Gary Rollins : We don\u2019t -- weather-wise we had our share of bad weather, so I think as Eddie shared with you these different segments of our businesses grow with different rates, different times. Which complement each other frankly with we don't have all down, all of the two different degrees. We don't see any big obstacle out there that\u2019s going to knock us off those plans. Joe Box : Got it. One quick one for you. Eddie you mentioned increased tech productivity, can you just put some numbers around the average stops for technician or maybe revenue per tech. Just to give us a sense of how much it was up in Q4. Eddie Northen : We don't -- we don't break that out, we will have technicians that will be in range of 8 to 10 jobs, it will tend on density and role verses urban areas but we are continuing to be better stops per mile from our virtual management system and we're able to see better productivity that's kind of a byproduct out there. So that's what we're -- you know, as we continue to have BOSS become more mature and our last regions went on in August of last year. So as those become more mature, and as virtual management becomes more fully adopted, I think we will see these numbers continue to incrementally get better. Joe Box : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Gentlemen, good morning. Gary I don't -- I don't recall ever seeing a press release announcing seventeen franchise starts in a single press release. Can you give us a little bit more color on that and the following questions that would be is are creating new franchises that more of a point of emphasis now and maybe fill us in on some of the economics to get an upfront from nice folks. How is that all work. Gary Rollins : Well we did get a kind of an initiation fee. Depending on the population we have for the bases what that first major payment is, we have minimal requirements as far as the payments going forward. We certainly don't want to give in involved in having to audit the books of 50 different businesses. So we have a percent that we get and then we have a minimum. So we feel like we are kind of protective as for the accounting concerned, there's accounting standards that are different from country to country. We've done very well in China, we have a very good relationship with the head of the Chinese pest control authority, which is a government employee, in fact, she came to a month ago and I think that's been helpful. But we've been working, this is not been a quick thing because we've been working in China for five or six years, it just it they all kind of came to head at the same time, they're like 15 or 20 cities over there with five million plus people and most of them most of us don\u2019t even know their names. We think there's going to be a lot of potential, it won't be much residential business, but commercial wise and China's really growing by leaps and bounds and we think it's going to have very beneficial commercial pest control market. Unidentified Analyst : Now did you all the announcement came, I guess the week or so, but I think in your prepared remarks you said these were actually created in the fourth quarter is that it was just a 4Q event or 1Q event. John Wilson : Jamie, this is a 4Q event. Unidentified Analyst : Q4, okay. John Wilson : They were added in Q4, which took us total of 70. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and then just follow the question, when you say most of it's commercial, I mean presumably, I mean these big cities, you've got a lot of apartment buildings; so are these residential apartment buildings that you are all just defining as commercial, is that how we should think about it or am I wrong? John Wilson : Yes, so Jamie, in most there is outside of the U.S residential pest control is not necessarily -- there not a lot of countries that look at residential pest control something they would pay for, there are some exceptions that the U.K. is an exception, exception of Australia, and there are few others that are out there, Canada is an exception, but most of the other countries it's all do yourself on a residential to a personal perspective. So some of the markets are making some slight changes with that, but for the most part we say commercial, we're talking about food, we're talking about hospitals, other different areas purely commercial perspective. There may be a sprinkling of those buildings that are like that, but for the most part it would be purely commercial residential. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, well, I appreciate the clarification. Operator : And we will go next to Joan Tong with Sidoti. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joan Tong : Hi guys, a very good quarter just have a couple of questions here. Eddie, so the VRM or maybe Gary, for the VRM we are talking about last quarter you said you optimize half of the route. Can you give us a quick update in terms of are you making any progresses, like maybe having that model or that platform to optimized more route and you talk about improvements and productivities, and all that. Just kind of sort of give us an update. Gary Rollins : Yes, so that number of 50% Joan moved up closer to 75% of the route been optimized on a daily basis. And again this is just us going through and getting everybody more comfortable with -- with not only the technology itself but with the use of the technology, and have that become part of the daily routine. So as we -- as we're able to continue to do that, we will be able to get more of the, more of the route optimize that front, and in the next step from there is to take the steps that we can to not disrupt those optimized routes, as best as possible. So we're going to continue to see incremental gain that are going to occur. I think quarter by quarter by quarter with that as the branches learn and understand better ways to be able to keep those routes that have been optimized run in the best way to can. Joan Tong : I see. Eddie Northen : And Joan, if I may add; so that the savings there with optimizing is the 20% to 25% reduction in miles driven, the benefit the company will show up with our improved fuel cost and wear and tear on our fleet. The big bang for the buck, we feel is an improved customer service and attention to our customers and what we're really working with our teams in the field now, is to just to improve the amount of service time they spending quality come and spend with that customer. So that's what that's all about. Joan Tong : Right. I'm just wondering is there any way to sort of like things some sort of any of you can talk about any tangible like resulting how we measure our customer service and Gary, obviously you mentioned the positive like promotion for and that's one thing. And also that costumer 360 maybe you can incorporate some of those survey results back to the analytics, you have and drive better improvement a customer like experience going forward. Can you just give us a little more color? Gary Rollins : Yes, so that's exactly right. The 360 survey scores really we see that correlating with our customer retention metric, and improving that can be big for our company, no question. Joan Tong : Got it. And then obviously very strong like operating margin. If you exclude that $9 million one-time items there, you had talked about 16% like operating margins for a seasonally weak quarter, very strong results and then all of Eddie, you mentioned that some of the reasons behind other than property is the BOSS benefits but also you get some reductions or some gain in their group health, insurance costs and all that. Can you sort of quantify like how much of that expansion margin expansion is related to health care costs coming down? And how much is more sort of the benefit that we are actually seeing on the process? Eddie Northen : Yes. So Joan, Q3 we saw an expansion of about 90 basis points, we think that we're continuing to see maturity in the BOSS with VRM, we think that's going to be a little bit better which is -- which is helping with the total net margin that we are operating margin which you see. Those are dollars obviously push back in the previous quarters and you look at the full year margin of the 70 pests I think that is really representative of where we are with it. So I think that Q3 and we had a little bit more maturity in BOSS and VRM, and it proves that 90 basis points I think that's probably more representative of where the quarter would be outside of the casualty and the medical. Joan Tong : I see, got it. And then finally for next year I would say for 2017. I think in the past you mentioned that you would continue to stand in technology to stay ahead of the competitors and making sure good customer experience and all that, and I just want to see if you have any like initiative you can call out that you're planning for 2017 in terms of technology spending, and then maybe you can quantify that in terms of maybe the impact to operating expense. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes Joan, I think that's a good question. We're still getting down the path of that, we're from this from a strategy perspective, we kind of narrow down about three or four items that we want to continue to spend our time and energy on, and ultimately our dollars on, part of that focus on customer experience. But we've not finalized exactly what that is going to be that time with dollar amount at this point. So we'll keep you informed as we -- as we kind of talk through this as we can figure out next steps, the good news is that we have some good opportunities in a few different areas, and we've got some good folks with great expertise that I think can help us get down these path. So we\u2019ll share more once we get that kind of narrow down. Joan Tong : All right, thank you guys. Eddie Northen : Thanks, Joan. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I'll take our next question from Sean Kennedy. Please go ahead, your line is open. Sean Kennedy : Good morning guys. My question also concerns growth. How are you finding the current hiring environment in terms of attracting enough quality employees necessary to sustain your growth, has it become more difficult since we've been hearing that and challenging for other companies as employment has gotten tighter generally, thanks. John Wilson : Yes, Sean this is, Joe Wilson. It is difficult but it always has been, I don't think our industry jumps out it whether its college graduates, recent college graduates or people seeking to leave where they are today to go -- to come work in our industry. So what we what we try to do is have a very defined process around the hiring process and our operations and our branches are taught to follow that pretty rigorously and they turn over a lot of rocks to find those good quality people. And I think the final thing I would say is our greatest source of new employees has been our current employees. We get somewhere near 40% or so of our new employees from referrals of our current employees and we have a reward system that in place that pays them for bringing forward those good people but that's our best source. Sean Kennedy : Yes, got it. Thanks, but have you -- has it been more difficult lately, have you seen that just as employment gotten tighter or has it just generally been the same. John Wilson : I think it's generally the same, we still have to turn over a lot of rocks to find the ones we want, but it is I think is still the same. Gary Rollins : Sean, it's just how do that, we take a look at retention our employee retention rate and how they have friended and we compare that to the overall unemployment rate, we could do better in the overall employment rate, unemployment rate. So I think to John point, we're having work a little harder but once we're finding those employees were able to -- able to retain at least better than the overall unemployment rate has [indiscernible]. John Wilson : I think I can add one thing to that as far as VRM we're creating a better job for service technicians, there was been a tremendous amount frustration for the technician, getting himself organized, and find out he's in an unfamiliar area and we didn't -- he doesn't live, absolutely he has more capacity because of being better organized, most of our technicians are on a productivity pay plan, so they can make more money and if you have a more satisfied employee, with a better work experience, earning more then you're going to have less turn around. Sean Kennedy : Great, I got it thanks for the detail guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and we have a question from Alex Connelly with SM Investors. Please go ahead, your line is open. Alex Connelly : Thank you. I have only one question left at this point which is just [indiscernible]. You are talking about a $9 million charge for the Canadian entity, that's an SG&A. I'm assuming that the contract or the credits that is in provision for income taxes, is that correct? Eddie Northen : Yes, it is correct. It would impact the overall tax rate which was lower and ultimately had no impact on the net income, so that\u2019s exactly right. Alex Connelly : Alright, thank you so much. Operator : And at this time we have no further questions. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to our new year, and we'll continue to work hard to grow and improve our business. Thanks, again. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Management will make some opening remarks and then we will open up the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you, Marilynn and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2017 conference call. Eddie will read forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we\u2019ll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statements we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We\u2019re extremely pleased to have posted record results for the quarter as well as our 44th consecutive quarter of improved revenues and profit. That\u2019s 11 years. I don\u2019t know where the time went. For the quarter, revenues grew 6.4% to $375.2 million compared to $352.7 million for the same period last year. Net income before taxes rose 11.9% to $57.3 million compared to $51.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. Net income rose 26.1% to $40.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to $31.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. While our operating results were outstanding, the higher net income and earnings per share for the quarter were significantly boosted by a lower tax rate, which was mostly related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which Eddie will discuss going forward. All of our business lines experienced good growth with residential up 7%, commercial pest control grew 5.3%, and termite rose 7.5%. Our employees service millions of people every year; we\u2019re well aware of how our customers\u2019 lives could be affected by pests that are a health threat. That\u2019s why health and public safety are always top of mind with us. Earlier this morning, CNN -- this month rather, CNN released a study recognizing that the world is at more risk than ever for a global pandemic. And while I\u2019m not on going to draw [ph] on this, material reinforces the importance of the services we provide, both to our customers as well as the public at large. According to CNN\u2019s material, more than 28,000 people were infected with the Ebola epidemic during 2014 through 2016, with over 11,000 deaths and as of March 10th this year, 84 countries have reported Zika transmission. This disease was discovered in the 1940s but had its first outbreak in 2007 in Micronesia and really began spreading toward the end of 2015. As the U.S.\u2019s largest or one of the largest providers of residential mosquito service, we feel that we have an important role in protecting and educating the public concerning this pest. We routinely provide mosquito information through our internet sites and other means with guidelines on how people can reduce the risk of having a mosquito problem. When there are significant instances of record-setting heat and flooding events as were recently experienced, regrettably, they create the ideal opportunity for mosquito infestations along with exposure to accompany transmitted illnesses and disease. In order to ensure that we stay at the forefront of mosquito research and data, we partner with numerous related organizations and universities. Most recently members of our Orkin technical service team attended a two-day event hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The purpose of this gathering of experts from around the world was to share scientific and practical initiatives on reducing the incidence of disease transmitted by the mosquito, specifically Aedes aegypti, this mosquito is also known as the yellow fever mosquito. Discussions centered primarily on Zikas, dengue, and chikungunya virus with those are [indiscernible]. We have been a collaborative partner with the CDC since the early 2000 on a wide range of initiatives including developing educational pest related material, field pest elimination project, participating in research studies, conducting Train the Trainer courses and jointly providing public service messages about pest prevention measures. We are convenient to these collaborations and initiatives of public service, while internally providing our technicians with the best products and industry-leading training. This enables us to deliver safer and more effective pest protection for all of our customers. Well, enough about pest and related health initiatives. I would like to now turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. As an example of our deep commitment to the further development of our people, this year marked the 20th year of conducting our companywide leadership meeting. In January, we engaged our top managers in team building exercise and reinforced our priorities for the New Year. As Gary voices contentiously, we know we can always do better for the benefit of our customers, for our employees and our shareholders. And we always approach that annual event with that challenge in mind. During this two and a half day conference we participate and exercise that\u2019s focused on improving our operations with the primary objective to improve our customer service experience, specifically through improving our all important employee engagement experience. We know a happy and engaged employee will always deliver a better customer service experience. When I joined the Company 22 years ago, we were a much smaller organization. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we have continued to grow year after year. Successfully growing our business depends on our ability to hire the right people, train and then and most importantly to retain them. A tenured, well-trained employee helps to ensure the great customer service experience. Our model is to never disappoint, which well explains our commitment to customer satisfaction. Those of you who attended our analyst day in September last year may recall my having said the one thing that remains the key to our success in the past, present or future will be our people. In order to survive and thrive, we have to maintain the highest standards for those people. Our objective is to hire A players to bring to the Company. We look at every opportunity when we add an employee as an opportunity to improve our team. To accomplish this, we consider many candidates, and prior to inviting them to join us, we spend a lot of time learning about them and educating them about us, our Company and its culture. We are looking for the ideal fit. Notably, our employee demographics are rapidly changing. Last year, over 60% of our new hires were millennials, born between 1982 and 2000. Recognizing the significance of this, we engaged Jason Dorsey, as our guest speaker at the leadership meeting. Jason is a highly recognized authority on millennials and Gen Y. Jason provided great insight about this group of individuals and how we can mutually benefit as they join our workforce. We believe the evolution we are experiencing in our workforce can have tremendous upside for our customers and our business. But we recognize, in order to retain these new hires, we have to be more knowledgeable of their characteristics and adapt accordingly. That challenge begins with their first day on the job. To that end, we\u2019re improving our onboarding and new hire orientation processes. This introduction helps provide them a sense of belonging to our Company and to better understand our culture. We\u2019re also surveying our new hires at regular intervals to gauge how they feel about their experience with us and to ensure that appropriate initiatives are being implemented in the field. In summary, we feel strongly that we need to stay connected with our changing workforce to ensure that we can continue to attract and keep top talent at our company. With these changes, our shared and other initiatives, we\u2019re seeing good improvement in employee retention, which as we have explained in the past, results in higher customer retention. In that regard, we were extremely honored this year to have been recognized as one of our areas\u2019 top workplaces by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The top workplaces lists are based solely on the results of an employee survey administered by WorkplaceDynamics, a research firm that specializes in organizational health and workplace improvement. Special aspects of workplace culture were measured, including alignment, execution and commitment. This was a great recognition for us and is another example of our Company\u2019s commitment to our employees and their future. This time every year, we enjoy viewing our latest commercials, which began airing last month. They help us deliver Orkin\u2019s primary branding message of Pest Control Down to a Science. This year\u2019s subtheme, Every Home is Unique, supports that branding message. Let me take a moment to share one or two of my favorites with you. One commercial centers around a neat freak that his house is really, really clean but as the home owner discovers, pests can still find their way into even the neatest of homes. Enter the Orkin Men with his great knowledge and scientifically-based treatment. But those of you familiar with the new trend in the growing population living in tiny houses, you\u2019ll discover that rats can find their way into these unique homes quite easily. Again, the Orkin Men to the rescue. Hope this entices you to take a moment to view these unique commercials. Before handing the call back to Eddie, I wanted to note a couple of promotions which recognize our management strength and depth. Mitch Smith has been promoted to Division President Orkin South Central Division. Mitch began his Orkin carrier as a branch manager in 1989 and has risen through the ranks during his tenure having served as Regional Manager, Regional Vice President and most recently, Division Vice President. Brady Camp was promoted to President of our HomeTeam Pest Defense. Previously, he served as Vice President of Operations and Division Vice President of HomeTeam\u2019s Eastern operation. Speaking of HomeTeam, last month, they achieved a significant milestone of having 1 million installations of their Taexx built in pest control system. This accomplishment emphasizes the strength of HomeTeam\u2019s relationship with its over 1,000 home builders nationwide, which include the top ten national home builders. Congratulations to Mitch, Brady and HomeTeam. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. 2017 is off to a very good start. Our operations, both domestic and international are energized as an outcome of our January leadership meeting that John mentioned. All of our service lines showed consistent growth and keys for the quarter included continued margin expansion, updates for the BOSS system which improved overall routing efficiency, processing of termite billing and credit card payments and an ongoing positive tax impact due to accounting standards update ASU 2016-09 related to our stock-based compensation. Looking at the numbers, the Company reported first quarter revenue of $375.2 million, an increase of 6.4% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter\u2019s revenue of $352.7 million. For the quarter, income before income taxes increased 11.9% to $57.3 million. Net income was positively impacted by the tax changes that Gary mentioned, and increased 26.1% to $40.3 million with earnings per share up 20% to $0.18 versus $0.15 per diluted share last year in the first quarter. When you take out the impact of the tax changes, net income rose 12.7% and earnings per share was up 13.1% to $0.17 compared to $0.15 last year. Overall, our operations and sales teams started the year very well, and our BOSS system continues to support additional improvement. In Atlanta, we had more than our fair share of growth disruption of the past few months, and enhanced routing and scheduling functionality has been especially helpful around here. Our routing and scheduling efforts continue to become more mature each quarter they\u2019re in use and our IC [ph] group also continues to enhance the capabilities by automating the route optimization daily and adding capabilities for our call center to have better visibility to branch capacity when scheduling a new customer. This will be extremely useful during our busy time for the year, to ensure we\u2019re improving the initial customer experience that we provide. Another IC improvement related to customer experience is the enhanced functionality of accepting credit cards by our technician through the BOSS application. This was -- this has improved the payment process for both the customer and our operations for many of our accounts. And finally, the use of the BOSS system to complete the billing of our termite customers has improved this entire process. We anticipate continued customer and financial benefit as we move throughout 2017. Let\u2019s take a look to the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increased of 6.4% included 1.2% from acquisition and the remaining 5.2% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control which made up 41% of our revenue was up 7%. Commercial pest control which made 41% of our revenue was up 5.3%. And termite and ancillary services which made up 18% of our revenue was up a very strong 7.5%. Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 5.2%; from that residential was up 6.8%, commercial up 3.4% and termite was up 5.8%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 5.3%; residential grew 6.8%; commercial pest control was up 3%; and termite was up 6.3%. Commercial was most impacted by the weak Canadian and Australian dollars as most of our business in these countries is commercial. Bed bug revenue continues to grow at a faster rate than our Company growth rate. For Q1, our bed bug revenue grew at 9.3%. Our data analytics continues to help us to set the best way to grow recurring bed bug revenue and to improve our profitability. Each of the last several quarters, we have continued to improve our sales process to ensure we are prioritizing the right customers to grow this product the best way for both the top and bottom line. I mentioned the efforts our marketing and advertising group last quarter, and I hope that you\u2019ve had a chance to see their most recent work. In addition to what John mentioned, we have featured our Orkin woman in a great termite fight and have run our first ever ad dedicated to mosquitoes with the theme of taking your yard back. We believe these efforts will help to continue to drive our termite and pest control demand as we move throughout the year. In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat the last year at 50.4%. The margin for the quarter benefited from improved efficiencies in routing and scheduling, which helped both service and administrative salaries as a percent of revenue. In addition, personnel related expenses were down as a percent of revenue as group insurance and auto liability expenses were less quarter over quarter. This was offset in part by an increase in fleet expense with higher fuel prices. While the cost per gallon for Orkin increased $0.44, the miles driven per vehicle were down 2.8% as a result of our improved efficiency from enhanced routing and scheduling through the virtual route management system. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $2.1 million to $13.8 million, an increase of 18.3%. Depreciation was $6.9 million, increasing $1.5 million with most of that increase related to our BOSS software, iPhone and printer depreciation. Amortization was $6.9 million, which increased $597,000 with amortization of intangibles asset increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts of the acquisitions of Murray Pest Control, and Scientific Pest Control in Australia, as well as various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $2.9 million or 2.6% to 30.7% of revenues, down 1.1 percentage points from 31.8% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to improvements administrative salaries and overtime as a percent of revenue which has been held by the BOSS implementation. This expense was offset by planned higher sales salaries and advertising expenses. Let\u2019s take a minute on the tax impact. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2017 was 29.7% versus 37.6% in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of financial Accounting Standards Board Update number 2016-09, also known as ASU 2016-09, which recognizes the excess tax benefit of stock-based awards as a reduction to income tax expense instead of the previous methodology, which reported the benefit on the balance sheet. The adoption of this standard generated a $0.01 benefit to the earnings per share in the quarter. We expect the effective rate to be slightly less than the last year number for quarters two, through four. The Company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of below 37% for the 2017 year. We expect to see continuing favorable volatility in the first quarter\u2019s tax rate for the next several years. Most of our Company\u2019s stock grants vest in the first quarter of each year. As for our cash position for the three months ending March 31, 2017, we spent over $3 million on acquisitions and $25 million on dividends, up 14.7%. We had $5.3 million of CapEx, which was down 39.1% in 2016, primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with a $162 million in cash, up 32.7% from last year. Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.115 per share that will be paid on June 9, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 10, 2017. The cash dividend is a 15% increase over the prior year. This marks the 15th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. We\u2019re off to a great start and are well-prepared to continue to move forward in 2017. I will now turn the call back to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We\u2019ll be glad to take any questions that you might have at this time. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Sean Kennedy with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed. Sean Kennedy : Good morning, guys. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Sean Kennedy : I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on the ASU tax benefit; specifically, what we can expect going forward? Can we expect the lower tax rate in the first quarter, could you just comment on that? Eddie Northen : Yes, Sean. So, for us, as I\u2019m sure you are aware that the tax benefit is based on the share price, the difference between the vesting time and the grant time. For us, our stock price has been up. And therefore, we received a tax benefit. So, the $4.3 million will be obviously the biggest impact in Q1. But as I stated below what we would historically see year-over-year as far as tax rates for two through four. And we anticipate the full year rate being slightly less than 37%. And the way that this pronouncement is written, we would see again based on the -- based on the stock price at the time of vesting, we would see similar gains in future years for that. Sean Kennedy : Great. Thanks for the detail. Eddie Northen : Helpful? Sean Kennedy : Yes, yes, definitely. Also, one follow-up question. Do you have a sense that you\u2019re gaining share versus your competition? And then, could you comment on specifically commercial, residential and pest control? Eddie Northen : We believe that we\u2019ve been incrementally growing market share in total for the last several quarters. And we believe a piece of that is because of the digital marketing efforts that our marketing group has had in place that has helped us to be able to reach, especially on the residential side, been able to reach, I think a broader group of customers. And in addition to that, we continue to fine tune on the commercial sales side and continue to grow there as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Sean Egan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Egan : I had a quick item on what we can expect to see as far as a reasonable incremental operating profit figure, heading forward, now that we\u2019re starting to get into a lot of the benefit to the BOSS. We\u2019re not trying to be nitpicky here, but it was about 27% this quarter. I think we look for a little more, just kind of looking for a little bit of guidance there. Eddie Northen : We know that we\u2019ll continue to see improvements in the overall margin, I think at all levels I think starting with the operating margin and gross margin as well. And of course, we feel that BOSS is going to continue to be able to be a driver of that. We\u2019re not going to give guidance as far as specifics. We\u2019re going to continue to get incrementally better. And I think we continue to find areas or ways where BOSS is going to be able to help us with that. I mean, we talked a lot about the routing, scheduling and on future calls we\u2019ll give some more specifics on what we\u2019re seeing there as far as improvement. But just the fact that IC was able to bolt on with some addition this quarter having to do with termite billing and the acceptance of credit cards by all of our technicians at this point in time. All those things are going to continue to help streamline, both in the operational and the non-operational side as we\u2019re continuing to move forward. So we\u2019ll give some more specifics having to do around the BOSS metrics again on future calls. But we continue to see good improvements in a lot of areas. Sean Egan : Got you. And then, moving to the M&A front. Have you seen valuations rise at all or at least asking prices, given the move in public equities over the last, call it six months? Eddie Northen : I mean, there\u2019re lots of companies that we would probably like to have a part of the Rollins family. From a multiple perspective this makes sense to us and other companies that have been buyers that it does make sense. So, we will continue to use the same prudence that Rollins has had in place for years. And when there is a good fit, if the seller\u2019s trying to find the right partners to partner up with that\u2019s when we win. We deployed 40% more capital a year ago than we -- in 2016 than we did in 2015, and that included the Critter Control franchise that we bought in 2015. So, we continue to find good quality partners to match up with and to be able to acquire. Are some of our competitors paying other higher multiples than historic multiples? Absolutely. And you know who some of those are and what those sellers are. But we feel that we will continue to be prudent and as we are continue to find those that make sense both financially and from a cultural perspective, then we will pull the trigger and we\u2019ll move forward. Gary Rollins : And if I can add something, we think that we have got really a lot of opportunities in critter control area. People, the franchises have not had an exit program per se; their strategy was just to add franchises and really had very little to help the franchises with their business. We have a full time personnel that really is leading and travelling with the franchisees and sharing key learnings because if we improve their business, they are certainly going to be improving our royalty stream and they are also going to be improving our likelihood of want to buy them when their franchise expires. So, I witnessed waste management come into the industry several decades ago, paid a lot of money, had a lot of different companies to try to put together, had a very difficult time doing so, and then retracted from the industry. I am not saying that\u2019s going to happen again but I did learn a key thing from that is that when you buy these companies, they have different operating systems and different procedures and policies, and you start trying to roll them up and put them together that\u2019s a very complicated difficult endeavor. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Joan Tong with Sidoti & Company. Joan Tong : You guys talked about 60% of your new hires is like millennials. And I just want to see if there is any change in employees, turn rate. And also the second question is regarding the receptive -- or reception to technology. Obviously, I can imagine it\u2019s pretty high and that should play to your because there was already new technologies, and the route management and all this new stuff that employees have to use and have Gen X being pretty receptive to technology; I think it should be a benefit to you guys. Can you just comment on those two? Eddie Northen : Joan, I\u2019ll give you my view and John is much closer to it than I am. But kind of starting with the latter. You\u2019re spot on. I mean, the technology piece is much easier for the Gen Ys and for Xs, much easier to adopt I think in that perspective. But I got to tell you in my personal interaction with probably 100 plus technicians of all ages, there has been an overwhelmingly positive feel for the technology and for the capability. Gary said it very well. The technology is enabling them to have a smoother day and have a more fulfilling overall involvement with their job because things are more scheduled. So, I think that part is going to definitely be a help. And I think as far as the overall churn rate or retention rate of our employees, it\u2019s relatively the same. And I think that\u2019s part of what, John, was talking about is the onboarding of these employees may look a little bit different. I think it\u2019s the reason why John\u2019s taken that on. John, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment more on that. John Wilson : Yes. Thank you, Eddie. And the turnover rate, Joan, has not been hugely different between millennials, surprisingly to me. And as a matter of fact, when we looked at it, I learned that baby boomers were the highest. And I suspect that that\u2019s largely because physically as they age, they\u2019re struggling to complete the work or do the job. But it\u2019s not been a huge difference, despite what you hear about the millennials taking a job and leaving it compared to our older workforce. What we want to do is zero in through the various methods that I outlined, and try to improve that, not only with them, but the other categories as well. Joan Tong : Okay. Fair enough. And then, my next question is related to, you talk about investing back to the business. I know that you guys don\u2019t make any proprietary pesticides or chemicals, but in terms of the pest control methods, have that evolved over time with technology improvement? I just wanted to see what you\u2019re doing on that front. And obviously, Gary, you mentioned about mosquitoes. Is it like a new method or new way to improve efficacy to your competitors. They have been pretty vocal talking about enhancing pest control methods, just want to get an idea of what you guys are doing on that front. Thank you. Gary Rollins : Well, I think it depends on the pest. Certainly, there\u2019s not been any big technological changes as far as mosquito control is concerned. It doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not some new material around the corner. But so far, there has not been a secret weapon per se. But if you look at some of the other ideas, heat has been a new and different form of pest control, which is very effective in the bed bug area. That has not characteristically been pest control means. They are experimenting now with dry ice as far as rodent and control. They\u2019re trying to take statistics and so forth. One of the difficult things about that is it\u2019s hard to get death counts because when a rodent dies, -- it is going to be complicated to measure the effectiveness. There\u2019s birth control product that\u2019s out being tested now as far as growth rodent control is concerned. I think those things would be the most memorable or remarkable I guess the way to say it. But the industry is evolving. There is major pesticide producers typically. The path of residential pesticide is to agriculture. Agriculture is so much larger than the conventional pest control. And those products are developed and perfected and often they migrate into pest control. But other than those, say those three new forms of technology, there\u2019s not a lot of change they can put. Joan Tong : Okay. Got it. John Wilson : Joan, if I may, the only thing I might add is commercially, for rodent control, there\u2019s been the development of RFID type of technology for rodent base stations where you can monitor from afar activity. But that\u2019s an evolving piece of technology. We\u2019re still fiddling with that as are others in our industry, just trying to figure out the economics of that. And the concern is always, it doesn\u2019t work what in enough time to react for your customers, particularly sensitive ones like food processing and manufacturing. Joan Tong : Got it. Thank you. And then, one last question, I will jump back in the queue. Obviously the tax discussion from tax plan discussion in front and center today, I just want to get a reminder from you, how much of your business is actually based in U.S. because you did make some acquisitions recently in UK as well as in Australia, just want to get a sense, I believe a majority part of it is generated from the discussion from U.S., just want to get a percentage there. Eddie Northen : Joan, you\u2019re exactly right and we listed in our 10, about 93% of our total is in the U.S., so of course we\u2019re paying the U.S. tax rate on that. And historically we\u2019ve had a tax rate that\u2019s been close to full rate at almost 38%. Based on this discussion, we had today, separate from corporate tax reform, based on discussion we had today on our ASU 2016-09, we feel as though that our tax rate will be a percent lowerish than where we have been historically, but yes 93% is in the U.S. Gary Rollins : I think you also got a wildcard on what they\u2019re going to do in Washington. Certainly, I think we are well-managed and performing company. And I think that certainly the reduction in our tax rate would help and I would also say, bring foreign money back into the country. We have quite a substantial operation in Canada. And here\u2019s the talk of changing the rules where corporations are more encouraged to bring foreign profits back into the United States. That would certainly be welcomed as far as we\u2019re concerned. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you. We really appreciate your interest. We look forward to reporting our second quarter results. And I think we\u2019ll have more, as Eddie said, we\u2019ll have some more information with BOSS. I think we now have two regions where our virtual route management automatically is in place; we\u2019ll have more conversion as far as that\u2019s concerned. We think it could be a game changer as far as our business is concerned. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We were pleased to have posted record results for the quarter as well as our 45th consecutive quarter of improved revenues and profits. For the quarter revenues grew 5.5% to $433.6 million, compared to $411.1 million for the same period last year. Net income before taxes rose 11.9% to $86.1 million, compared to $77 million for the second quarter of 2016.

In the second quarter all of our business lines experienced good growth with residential of 5.9%, commercial pest control grew 5.1% and termite and ancillary rose 6.1%. Revenues for the first six months grew 5.9% to $808 million, compared to $763.9 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 17.9% to $93.9 million. EPS of $0.43 per diluted share, compared to $79.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share. John and Eddie will provide greater detail in a moment. I want to personally express how pleased we were to have announced yesterday our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating, Inc. We have all admired Northwest, their management team and accomplishments and believe they will be an exceptional addition to Rollins. Founded by the Phillips family in 1951 and headquartered on the outskirts of Atlanta and Marietta, Georgia. Northwest has been servicing the Southeast Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina for over 65 years. We look forward to working with the Phillips family and the Northwest Inc. During the quarter, we were also pleased to have expanded Orkin\u2019s presence internationally by adding six new franchises in Central America, South America and Southeast Asia. These franchises are located in Nicaragua, Lima, Peru, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and in Jakarta, Indonesia. We now have 76 franchises located around the world, building our Orkin brand. The new franchises will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite services where appropriate. The franchisees will receive their initial training at our award winning training center here in Atlanta, and they will receive ongoing training at their home location. As a people business, we believe the ability to advance and poise within our organization is important for the continued success of our company. In early May, we were therefore pleased to announce that Beth Chandler, Vice President and General Counsel has now assumed oversight for the Rollins Internal Audit department. One side with this Beth will also be serving on our Executive Steering Committee. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as General Counsel and her role was later expanded to include the Risk Management group. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re now adding the Internal Audit group to her responsibilities. This alignment provides stronger coordination between risk, legal and audit all with the focus of improving our fiduciary compliance. Congratulations are in order for Beth and we look forward to her future contributions. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. I too want to say how pleased we are to welcome Northwest Exterminating to the Rollins family of brand. The company has an excellent reputation and provides residential and commercial services including eco-friendly pest control and termite control solutions, Wildlife Services for animal control and removal and mosquito and bed bug services in each of the five states in which they operate. For their fiscal year ended 2016 Northwest recorded revenues of over $50 million. The company has 23 locations and 500 plus team members serving approximately 120,000 customers. Their revenue and customer base will significantly increase our market share in the Southeast. As Gary stated earlier Northwest is a company we have been attracted too for a long time. Their people, their culture and their commitment to quality service are all attributes that we value, when we look for the right company to add to our team. As we have successfully done in the past our plan is to support their impressive results by sharing best practices with one another. Northwest will be identifying areas of synergies that they can leverage are being part of Rollins. The addition of Northwest fits our strategic model and profile for acquiring leading regional pest control companies that will strengthen our company. We know that in the highly competitive service industry, a company\u2019s positive culture helps create the environment for customer and employee retention. When you get the culture right, like Northwest obviously has, their team members drive customer loyalty and subsequently provides exceptional organic growth. Simply put a company like Northwest is an ideal fit for Rollins and aligns perfectly with our long-term business philosophy and strategy. As demonstrated in the past, Rollins has long distinguished itself acquisition wise by retaining key management, which helps us improve the overall business. Northwest Exterminating is no exception. The Phillips family with its third generations of family members, Steve \u2013 Stephen and Stanford Philips along with their impressive and highly tenure management team will continue to lead the Northwest operations. We are delighted to have them and all their employees as part of the Rollins group of leading pest control brand. People and people development are paramount to the future of our company. Rollins leadership is fully cognizant at this and we have stepped this as a top priority for our organization. Last quarter I talked about our employee on-boarding process. In future quarters I\u2019m going to talk more about this as well as our employee development initiatives. We will be investing a lot of time and energy in these areas to ensure that we attract and retain the best employees possible across all areas of our business. I will now turn the call back over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. Growing our business in the Rollins brand is always exciting for our company. When we look back over the acquisition through the years each time we have grown our top line revenue, customer count, net income and expanded our margin. We believe with Northwest that pattern will continue in a very positive way. I would also like to add my welcome for the team members at Northwest. When our family first moved to Atlanta four years ago, it was Northwest that knocked on our door and provided excellent pest control and termite services. The only sad thing for my family about my move to Rollins was having to part way with our Northwest test technicians. But as a side note, my wife does now love for Orkin technicians, so it worked out okay. I know first-hand that they are a quality company and how incredible their team members are at serving the customer. Well growing the business this way is exciting, our bread and butter is still our consistent recurring organic growth that John mentioned and it\u2019s a great area that Northwest has done extremely well. For the quarter all of our service lines showed balance improvement and key to the quarter included strong organic growth, continued margin expansion tied to BOSS and virtual route management and an ongoing positive tax impact due to accounting standards update ASU 2016-09 related to our stock-based compensation. Looking at the numbers the company reported second quarter revenues of $433.6 million an increase of 5.5% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter revenues of $411.1 million. For the quarter income before income taxes increased 11.9% to $86.1 million. Net income increased 12.4% to $53.7 million with earnings per share of 13.6% to $0.25 versus $0.22 per diluted share last year in the second quarter. Our revenue for the first six months was $808.8 million and that\u2019s a 5.9% growth rate. That number is directly in line with our 2016 full year growth rate. Income before taxes was up $143.4 million up 11.9% and net income was $94 million an increase of 17.9%. As a reminder our Q1 net income was positively impacted by the stock-based compensation tax changes. Earnings per share were $0.43 compared to $0.36 last year up 19.4%. Operation has absorbed the increased summer demand extremely well. Let\u2019s take a look to the revenue by service lines for the second quarter. Our total revenue increase of 5.5% included 6.1% from acquisition and the remaining 4.9% was organic growth. This organic growth rate is the best Q2 growth rate in five years. In total residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue was up 5.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue was up 5.1%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue was up 6.1%. The lapping of Murray Pest Control in Australia had a slight impact on the overall growth rate. The total revenue less acquisition was up 4.9% from that residential was up 6%, commercial increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary improved by 6%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign exchange in total we grew 5.2%, residential grew 6.1%, commercial pest control was up 3.9% and termite improved 6.4%. Well our field team performed very well this quarter, our marketing group continues to do an outstanding job creating demand and it\u2019s a key reason for our strong organic growth. This month our Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Kevin Smith invited me to tag along for a meeting with Google in Silicon Valley to take a look at our current initiatives in the phase of digital marketing and learn about opportunities related to demand creation moving forward. We learned a lot of the visit and while we may not be adding fan volleyball courts or net pots to our Atlanta office anytime soon. We did get a chance for some other great takeaway as we assess the market while expanding our use of technology. A key takeaway was our ability to continue to enhance our digital footprint with a goal of improving access for our customers with special emphasis on enriched mobile format experience. This is a great example of the bold forward thinking by our marketing team that has sustained our growth over the past several years. As we assess these technology updates we will keep you updated. In total, gross margin improved to 52.8% for the second quarter compared to 52.3% in 2016. The margin for the quarter benefited from improved efficiencies in routing and scheduling in technology, which also helps us increase productivity and to lower payroll as a percent of revenue. The gains that we experienced were partially offset by higher fuel prices and leads to be eco-cost. While the cost per gallon increased the miles driven per vehicle were down a little over 4%. We believe this is in part the result of the improved efficiency from our enhanced routing and scheduling through the virtual route management system. We expect to continue to see these benefits overtime. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the second quarter increased $1.2 million to $13.5 million, an increase of 9.7%. This percent increase will continue to subside as we lap our 2016 rollout of the BOSS initiative. Depreciation was $6.7 million increasing $713,000 with most of that increase related to our BOSS software, iPhone and printer depreciation. Amortization was $6.9 million, which increased $484,000 with amortization of intangibles assets increasing due mostly to amortize contract \u2013 customer contract of the acquisition of Murray Pest Control, and Scientific Pest Control in Australia, as well as various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $3.1 million or 2.5% to 29.9% of revenues down 9.1 percentage point from 30.8% for the second quarter of last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries as a percent of revenues, which continues to see incremental gains from the BOSS project. As planned the company experience increased sales salaries, sales promotion and advertising expenses directed towards increasing sales and revenue. As for our cash position for the six months ended June 30, 2017 we spent over $6 million on acquisition and $50 million on dividend, an increase of 14.7%. We had $11.2 million of capital expenditures, which was down 39.1% from 2016 primarily from the completion of the BOSS project. Rollins ended with $194.8 million in cash up 54.1% from last year. A large portion of our cash balance will be used for the Northwest acquisition, but by no means would this limit our ability or apatite to continue to pursue good quality pest control and wildlife companies like Northwest as we move forward. As you\u2019re probably aware, we hold $175 million line of credit and a $75 million credit sub facility that we would be willing and ready to use for the right opportunity. For many years Rollins has been considered the acquirer of choice, for many family owned companies. We feel that we are in a great position to continue to deploy capital to get the best return for our shareholders. From 2004 through 2010 the majority of our acquisition opportunity was only in the U.S. with the purchases of Western IFC, HomeTeam, Crane, Waltham and Trutech all of which are still run as independent brand. By expanding our pool for M&A opportunity outside of U.S. Pest Control, we\u2019ve been able to continue to add quality company to our portfolio services in Australia and the UK. Our entry into the wildlife industry here in the U.S. also has provided great expansion opportunities. Let\u2019s circle back to get some further details on Northwest from a financial perspective. Northwest historic growth rate is above our overall Rollins historic growth rate and we see that continuing by increasing prices, expanding sales of general pest to existing termite customers, continuing to grow the commercial pest services business, continuing to grow the mosquito service offering and possible geographic expansion. As stated earlier, we will run Northwest as a standalone company in our specialty brand category. As we look to make margin improvement our guiding principle when assessing our cost saving synergy is to first and foremost consider what is best for our new team members and their customers. We always want to make sure we are making things better. With this in mind we will evaluate opportunities in our back office support, utilizing Rollins\u2019 purchasing advantage on materials and supplies, and we\u2019re appropriate using Rollins\u2019 negotiated rates for vehicle and telephone just to name a few. As is the case in most pest control acquisition there were little intangible assets that will be acquired from Northwest. From an accounting perspective the majority of what we book, will be goodwill and customer contract. As a result, we will record an annual non-cash charge of approximately $5 million in amortization and interest expense. This will minimize our accretion in 2017, but we feel that it will add between $0.005 and $0.01 in 2018. Last night the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.115 per share that will be paid on September 11, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2017. The cash dividend is a 15% increase over the prior year. We are pacing to have the 15th consecutive year that the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Our continued organic growth coupled with our profit improvement and this excellent new partnership with Northwest have us well positioned for an excellent 2017. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions that you might have at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Box : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Joe. Joe Box : So, thanks for giving some color on Northwest. I appreciate that. Obviously this was a sizable deal. I was hoping maybe you could put some additional parameters around the transaction maybe in terms of margin profile, multiple-paid and then I don\u2019t know if you can give any color on what the breakdown would be between commercial, residential and termite. What is the comparison if it\u2019s heavier or lighter relative to your current book of business? Eddie Northen : Yes, Joe. So from a competitive perspective we\u2019re not going to give a lot of details of the deal. This is a sizable acquisition. In the press release, we talked about their 2016 reported revenues of over $50 million. So this is our largest deal that we\u2019ve done since HomeTeam. Their growth rate as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are better than our overall Rollins historic growth rate. Margins are going to help us overall. When you take a look at the business, the business is structured a lot like the HomeTeam business, they have \u2013 Northwest have an excellent relationships with a lot of builders, which has really enabled them to really have a foothold in the residential and the termite area of the business. So, I think from a structure perspective, you\u2019re going to see a little bit more weights in those areas, which have been very positive for us from a HomeTeam perspective. Joe Box : Got it. I guess with the business operating separately aside from just back office and probably some procurement savings that you guys could pick up. Can you just talk to maybe how you plan to leverage Northwest? John Wilson : I think the fact that there are great brands in the Southeast, their growth rates again have been significantly better than our overall growth rates. So adding them to the Rollins brand of family, this is going to be an excellent \u2013 I mean excellent opportunity. From a tax perspective, it\u2019s positive for us to structure the deal, within a very tax effective manner, which is going to enable us to amortize the intangibles over a period of time from a tax perspective. So for the financial side it\u2019s going to be positive. And it\u2019s another brand in the Rollins family of brand. This is going to continue to help us growth. Joe Box : Last one from me, kind of changing gears. Just sort of dig into the 43% incremental EBIT margin in 2Q. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of that incremental margin tailwind came from your traditional price volume improvement that you saw in the quarter? Whereas how much of the benefit maybe came from the BOSS tailwinds? John Wilson : Well, I think the BOSS tailwinds continue to improve. I think every quarter, we\u2019re seeing improvements that are coming from the routing and scheduling, which is tag onto BOSS. We\u2019re seeing improvements in the area of retention and certain pockets that have been on the longest, which of course is helping on the revenue side. So, pricing continues to be consistent, we are seeing good consistent pricing over the last now probably seven years. So I think that\u2019s a help for us. But I think the BOSS project overall, as we had said, that we felt it will continue to pick up theme and we\u2019ll continue to see the benefits from that. Joe Box : I guess maybe just \u2013 I don\u2019t want to hold it to something here, but I\u2019m obviously at 80 basis points of margin expansion \u2013 actually I\u2019m sorry, 120 basis points in margin expansion year-over-year. I mean was that 50% price volume, 50% BOSS? Eddie Northen : I don\u2019t know how to breakdown. Gary Rollins : It would be 50% BOSS. Where you are going to see the benefit in BOSS is then you\u2019re fleet and your payroll, and really the capacity. What they able to do is the service technician would be able to do take on more accounts across, you would be better organized. But it\u2019s going to be a slow situation. It\u2019s just a nature of our business, you\u2019re not going to go in and have your productivity go up 25% in six months or anything like that. But we\u2019re pleased with what we see and I think at this stage, you are about \u2013 more we expected to be at this point. Joe Box : Understood. Thanks guys next quarter. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joan Tong from Sidoti. Please go ahead. Joan Tong : Good morning. Congratulations on signing Northwest into the Rollins family. And I do have a question regarding the brand specifically the Northwest brand. Can you just give us a little bit color? It seems like they are on the high-end side in terms of pricing, the brand identity and strength. Is it very similar to your Orkin brand? Eddie Northen : Yes. I\u2019ll let John kind of help with that easy. He\u2019s really been directly involved with it. But I\u2019d say, in the Southeast area here and as I mentioned with my personal story in the Southeast area here, they\u2019re very strong. If you take a look at the Atlantic areas, North up here and then up in other states that we talked about Tennessee and Alabama and some into North Carolina. It\u2019s a regional brand that is extremely well known, they\u2019ve grown well overtime and continue to expand their footprint as they\u2019ve gone through time. John Wilson : Yes, Joan. Thank you for the questions. Northwest is a company we\u2019ve admired a long time, I\u2019ve known Philips, both Steve the father and then his two sons. They have an excellent reputation for great customer service, tremendous tenure in their staff. So they have a really, really good brand in the markets they operate. They are probably most similar to HomeTeam, and that they leverage relationships with builders. And the markets that they are in, they\u2019re very good competitors with them. Maybe compete less though with Orkin. But good business, very solid great leadership, tremendous team but they have a more of a residential mix and termite mix than Orkin does. Eddie Northen : Yes. And Joan just from a recognition perspective here, we have the Orkin diamond that this recognize, their recognize is from a pesky moth that is kind of their spokesperson, as far as their advertising and marketing concern, which has been extremely effective. I know in the areas here in the Southeast. So they are very well known from a recognition perspective. And I think that helped them with that and of course the quality of service that they provided has been an extraordinary\u2026 Joan Tong : Okay, got it, got it. And then historically you guys are very discipline with evaluation metrics when it comes to acquisition. So I know that for comparative purposes, you can\u2019t really disclose a whole lot of information, but just want to make sure that if evaluation is within your sort of like historical discipline? The way, we think about it. Eddie Northen : Yes, it is Joan. I mean we\u2019re on the higher end, of course we work for a great quality company that we have here. But that we\u2019re absolutely within, the areas that we would normally be, from an acquisition perspective. Joan Tong : Okay, got it, got it. And then, how about on the margin expansion side, and I have a question, regarding \u2013 seeing the margin expansion pretty nicely, showing up in your numbers. Obviously, better than last quarter, like it might have been by fuel cost is less of a drag. Can you just talk a little bit about like the puts and takes there and what is the fuel cost increase \u2013 negative impact in the quarter if there is any? John Wilson : Yes, the fuel cost net impact the quarter it was less than Q1, I don\u2019t have, Joan that number is in front of me, I can get that for you. Our miles that we\u2019ve reduced improved in Q2 then comparing it to Q1, so I think we\u2019re seeing \u2013 continuing to see those incremental benefits from BOSS and from the virtual route management team. We\u2019re continued to see it on the salary side, the portion of our salaries that we see reducing in our overall function that continues to incrementally improve. And we know that a piece of that is from some of the technology that we\u2019ve been able to put in place. We talked in previous quarters about being able to use the technology of BOSS on things like termite billing. Those types of things were being manually done in the past. And now they are being done using the technology through the BOSS system. And each time our IT team that\u2019s been able to identify and our operations have been able to implement that. We\u2019re getting those incremental benefits. And I think we\u2019re just seeing the accumulation of that as we\u2019re going through time. I mean, adding on these new items and then also seeing the accumulation of those, as we move in forwarded time. So miles, miles per gallon definitely help and then the payroll pieces it\u2019s been a substantial help as well. Joan Tong : Good, good, good. And then finally, I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. The additional marketing that you guys highlighted, during your prepared remarks. Any color, like what specifically you are looking at and maybe the timing to \u2013 maybe invest a little bit more. You guys have already been very proactive on that front. Just want to make sure that like at least talking about like the next six months. Or is it more like 2018 event, that you might have another step up, perhaps in the Northeast spending? John Wilson : We\u2019re actively evaluating everything from a customer experience perspective, both existing customers as well as customer acquisition. So before we get to a point, where we are ready to move forward any substantial dollars at all. We\u2019ll absolutely share that information with you. But I feel confident, we\u2019re down some good path, both with specifically the marketing side, taking a look at the mobile enriched format, as well as the items have to do with the strategy, and the customer experience in the technology that would go around that. Joan Tong : Okay. Thank you. John Wilson : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jamie Clement from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Jamie Clement : Gentlemen, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Jamie. Jamie Clement : So with respect to Northwest, and as this relates to builders, I mean, obviously with HomeTeam, we often the tax system. But it\u2019s risky as it\u2019s sounds like there\u2019s been a lot of success down there. In the PermaTreat business, is the PermaTreat business with builders, sufficiently geographically segmented, where Northwest has an advantage over somebody like HomeTeam in the Southeast is that part of the attractiveness here? How does that exactly work? Eddie Northen : Yes. We\u2019re not going to a lot of specific. I think your assessment of this is pretty well done. Northwest has been in this geographic area for 65 years and made developed relationships with builders over that period of time. And they provided great quality of service. So they\u2019ve had a foothold with a lot of the builders in the Southeast area for a long period of time. Even when HomeTeam goes to compete against those types of relationships, honestly it\u2019s been difficult for HomeTeam, to compete in some of the markets, where Northwest has had a long-term relationship. And that\u2019s part of the attractiveness to this deal into this company, because there\u2019s longevity, the quality of service they provide, and longevity with those relationships. Jamie Clement : Okay. John Wilson : Yes. Jamie let me \u2013 I may add, HomeTeam is relatively new company in our industry 20 years, anniversary last year. And so, Northwest has been in business for some 60 years. So HomeTeam has the Tubes in the Wall and they have good relationships with builders. Northwest has great people and great relationships with their builders. And while HomeTeam maybe have all the customers, we\u2019ll have Northwest take the rest. How about that? Jamie Clement : Sure, sure, absolutely. And different line of question, it didn\u2019t really come up much in your prepared remarks. I think you\u2019ve mentioned it once or twice, but can you talk a little bit about the mosquito business, you now that we\u2019re in the mid of the summer. It seems like, five or 10 years ago maybe customers weren\u2019t necessarily convince that the efficacy of mosquito offering was out of your industry. It seems like now you all demonstrated the customers that these services actually work. So expecting another summer of growth there? Eddie Northen : Yes, for sure, we are and Jamie, this is an area that has always been kind of one of those add-on that we\u2019ve had in the operation and we kind of sold it, when there was time to sell it. Marketing and the operations group maybe two years ago, really decided, we need to really put some more focus around it. Unfortunately we were squaring the time of the concerns on the Zika virus. So it was not something we were going to be proactive, and go out and try to market itself with the public fears that were out there. Jamie Clement : Right. Eddie Northen : Customers, as customers reached out to us, and if it makes sense at that point in time, we would talk to our customers about it. But the fears of Zika, kind of subsiding sound at least in the U.S., we actually run our first ever national TV commercial, which was taking back to yard\u2026 Jamie Clement : Yes. I noticed, I noticed. Eddie Northen : Yes, yes so that\u2019s the first time, we done a national commercial, we\u2019ve absolutely seen a positive impact from that and a lot of our operations are squarely, squarely focused in on this opportunity. Now, it\u2019s just been a matter of us being able to help educate and prepare our technician to make the act is really what it has been. Those pockets where they have been able to do that effectively, they\u2019ve been able to see some good results. I was visiting in the St. Louis area with our South Central division President, Commissioner and they had things up on the wall, number of days in a row if that they have change to sell a mosquito lead. They had dollar amounts up there. So making it fun, making it interesting and making it something that\u2019s kind of friend of mine. The sell of the product is an easy sell, if there is a need there, the product itself is an excellent, excellent product. 95% retention rate for our mosquito customers, so once people have a need and they see the service, it\u2019s a service that they really appreciate it and they want to hold on too. That\u2019s kind of where we are with that and we\u2019ve had good rates with that. We\u2019ve had low-teens to mid-teens for our growth rate, low base, obviously a low base it is not something that we concentrated all in the past. But we feel this is an opportunity for us, there is a little bit in forwarding time. Jamie Clement : Okay, great and last one if I may for Gary, you had Western Pest predominantly operating in the East. Now you got Northwest predominantly operating in the Southeast, what\u2019s the background of the Northwest Pest Control operating in the Southeast, any amusing story there? Gary Rollins : Yes, okay John insist, I assume this. John Wilson : That just happened to know it was named Northwest, way back in the 50, when they opened it on the Northwest side or section of Atlanta. Jamie Clement : Oh, okay. John Wilson : Up in Marietta. Jamie Clement : All right. John Wilson : Marietta is Top County based primarily. Gary Rollins : And that\u2019s very similar to the Western, because the way they got their name was, they were in Western New Jersey. So but anyhow they have done an excellent job with their advertising. As they said they have a concept, they have a mouse very colorful drawings and artwork. They do a lot of outdoor advertising with outdoor. And they\u2019ve done a very good job promoting their brand. Jamie Clement : Okay, terrific. Thanks so much for your time, as always. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay. No further questions. So I\u2019d like to thank you all for participating and being here today. We look forward to sharing our next quarter\u2019s performance with you. And we\u2019ll be working diligently on the programs and really creating \u2013 beginning of a good working relationship with the Northwest people. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We posted record results for the quarter as well as our 46th consecutive quarter of improved revenues and profits. For the quarter revenues grew 6.2% to $450.4 million, compared to $424 million for the same period last year. Income before taxes rose 3.2% to 82.6 million compared to 80 million with the third quarter of 2016. Net income rose 3.6% to $51.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $49.7 or $0.23 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.  Revenues for the first nine months grew 6% to $1.254 billion, compared to $1.183 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 12.4% to $145.4 million with earnings per share of $0.67per diluted share, compared to $129.4 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the prior year period. In the third quarter all of our business lines experience growth with residential up 6.1%, commercial pest control grew 4.9% and termite and ancillary rose 10.1%. We were disappointed however with the impact to profitability and revenue at hurricane Harvey on several of the company\u2019s branches and regions, South West in North Texas, South Central Commercial or Huston Metro, North Texas, Oklahoma Louisiana and Mississippi. These areas were negatively impacted by previous articulating preparation flood conditions, closed branches and our inability to service many of our customers.  Hurricane Irma followed starting at the end of August with a summer effect in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi again and Louisiana again. John and Eddie will provide more detail on this subject but I want to personally acknowledge how proud we're of our employees and their response to our customers during these two natural disasters. While all personnel were safe thankfully, many endured significant hardships in selling experience property damage of their own. Good dedication in getting our operations back up and running is admirable. We have some good news, on August 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Northwest Exterminating. Northwest was established in 1951 by the Phillips family and serves approximately 120,000 customers in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina. The purchase of this outstanding company will expand our presence in the Southeast. Northwest provides significant opportunity both for Rollins and Northwest to grow and learn from each other. We see many benefits from this combination. I would now like to turn the call over to John Wilson. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. When we lose access to our customers and employees even temporarily it affects our business tremendously. 100s of our associates and thousands of our customers across multiple brands and businesses were impacted by these storms. In several states as Gary indicated we experienced damaged operations and the ability of our employees to service many of their customers. Our team members were dealing with close roads and flooded highways that the impact of their ability to reach and safely service those customers and many of the impacted branch areas. During our highest impacts day 55 of our branches were closed. As an example, our mason Florida branch was without power for two weeks after the storm passed. We are pleased however that our people were unharmed; many of those who were involved were compensated although they were unable to work. The wellbeing our employees is always the top priority for us. Those of you familiar with our company may remember that in 2015 we announced the Rollins employee relief fund, or REIF. This is a nonprofit organization which we set up to make funds available to employees facing tragedies such as natural disasters like these, and medical emergencies or other crises. Over the past several weeks the REIF committee has worked earnestly reviewing situations and issuing emergency grants to dozens of Rollins employees affected by Harvey and Irma. I want to personally thank this committee for their support of our employees during the time of need. Most of our locations in Texas Florida and another areas in the south east are back up and running normally. All of these locations were finding other ways to support customers based on what their particular needs may be. In some cases, we are providing moisture remediation services to homes with serious flood damage. For others we will be reapplying termite protective barriers due to flooding and for many others we are providing mosquito services in the areas primarily where standing water exists. It is also noteworthy that BOSS our new branch operating system was a major benefit to us during these times. It allowed us to run our business remotely communicate with customers close our books and locations directly impacted by flooding and other storm related factors that caused to close branches. Even though we wish that we had not needed this flexibility, we are pleased to find via another benefit from our BOSS investment. Given the challenges that our people faced our operations performed well, but we all look forward to getting business back to normal. Speaking of BOSS with the [contending] maturation of that system and virtual route management in our operations our branch locations are changing the way they do things pretty dramatically. We have made brief references in the past or [4.2.0] which is what we're calling these transforms branch locations. As technology continues to be added and transactional work has reduced, we're more able to have the front-line branch support teams concentrate on an improved customer experience and a more timely and accurate routing and scheduling of our technicians.  We anticipate these changes to be fully rolled out to all branches by Q2 of 2018. Some of the positive outcomes that we have witnessed today are improved communication with customers including more frequent one call resolution, fewer incoming calls to our branch locations as our customers are more certain of their schedules, technicians driving less miles, which translates to better customer care and better technician work life balance. And service mangers spending more time outside of the branch, couching and mentoring technicians to name a few. As we continue to mature in this area, we believe that these efforts will enable us to continue to see margin expansion in the coming quarters. I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. I also want to add my thanks to all the Rollins employees that helped during the hurricanes. Along with John I want to thank the members of our employee relief fund committee, who showed tremendous diligence and support as they always do for those in need. While we celebrated new growth through the addition of our latest specialty brand partner Northwest Exterminating, in the same quarter we saw demand greatly subside in the most impacted areas from the storm.  While we normally refrain from discussing weather on these calls extreme weather does impact our customers and employees. When home or businesses are destroyed or significantly damaged our service deliver is not a priority.  Even in the face of the storms adversity, we thanks to the support of our operations team, we were still able to set record profits and revenue in Q3. For the quarter all of our service lines showed growth and improvements keys to the quarter included integration of Northwest Exterminating into our company, demand and costs impacts related to the storms and as John mentioned accelerated BOSS, branch transformation and implementation. Looking at the numbers the company recorded third quarter revenues of 450.4 million an increase of 6.2% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of 424 million. We closed on Northwest Exterminating on August 1st to realize two months of added revenue. For the third quarter as I mentioned our revenue and expenses were negatively impacted.  Income before income tax increased 3.2% to $82.6 million. Net income increased 3.6% to $51.4 million the difference related to positive tax credit and earnings per share was up 4.3% to $0.24 versus $0.23 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Our revenue for the first nine months of $1.259 billion is at 6% growth rate. Income before taxes was $226 million up 8.6% and net income was 135.4 million an increase of 12.4%. Earnings per share were $0.67 compared to $0.59 last year up 13.6%.  Let\u2019s take a look to the revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6.2% included 2.3% from several acquisitions of which northwest was the largest, and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. This 3.9% of organic growth is in line with our 2014 and 2015 growth rates.  In total residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue was up 6.1%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue was up 4.9% and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue was up 10.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.9%, and from that residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 3.9% and termite improved 3.3%. When you take a look at the quarter taking out the impact of foreign currency in total we grew 5.7% residential grew 6%, commercial pest control was up 3.2% and termite improved 10.5%. Many of you have asked about the impact of severe weather on pest populations as we move forward in time. Coincidently we recently had a meeting with Doctor Eric Benson, Professor of Entomology at Clemson University who is renowned for his study of ants. Doctor Benson shares that following hurricanes [indiscernible] in 1989, there was a significant increase later in the ant population. he surmised that their breeding was enhanced due to trees that had come down across the state. Additionally, many other pests have new moisture laden areas that creates prime environments for pest population expansion. Finally, our critter control and [indiscernible] tech people advised that when areas are severally storm disrupted the natural wildlife often are forced to move to different areas, which sometime include where people live and work. Animals such as raccoons, possums, bats and others become more visible as they seek new surroundings. As a result, our critter control business should see increased demand. Overall as a result of the hurricanes we believe that our customers' needs in this regard will increase in the coming months because of these factors. Another of the pest that will be impacted by weather disruptions are rodents. Dr. Beavers our Managing director of Technical Services and his team have ongoing testing related to new technology and products related to rodent management and rodent control. This team is involved in different stages of testings of dozens of different products and technology and we will continue to move forward with properly tested embedded options for our different customers' needs. We are hopeful that we will find better methods for rodent management in the future. As a result, as Rollins has done successfully throughout the years the integration of Northwest has begun. Communication is such an important piece of any integration. John and our team along with the Phillips family hit the road to get in front of the Northwest team members and to welcome them to Rollins. This group has 23 meetings at 21 locations in eight days. The results were very positive. From a business and integration perspective we have already started the process of margin improvement at Northwest by adopting better materials and supply purchasing using our vehicle leasing discounts and sharing revenue opportunities as well. An example is that Northwest serviced a large regional retail customer and had previously outsourced locations where Northwest did not have a branch presence. Working branches have replaced those previously outsourced locations, which will help to ensure a more consistent customer experience for this account.  In total, gross margin declined slightly to 51.4% for the third quarter compared to 51.5% in 2016. Our reduction in revenue from the storm combined with additional cost related to the storms and expenses related to integrating Northwest impacted the margin. For the quarter we benefited from improved efficiencies in routing and scheduling with the continued reduction in miles which help to lower salaries as a percent of revenue. The gains the company experienced were offset by higher personal lead cost from incorporating acquisition additional fleet expense which increase due to higher fuel prices and higher vehicle cost. And materials and supplies which were higher as we encored, as we increased our term line [batting] with the addition of Northwest.  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $1.2 million to $14.3 million, an increase of 9.4%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with the lapping of BOSS but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.8 million increasing $354,000 with most of that increase related to our BOSS software, iPhone and printer depreciation. Amortization was $7.5 million, which increased $876,000 with amortization of intangibles assets increasing due mostly to amortize customer contract of the acquisition of various Murray acquisitions made throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating.  Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $9.5 million or 7.6% to 30% of revenues up four times of the percentage point from 29.6% for the third quarter of last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to high sales commissions related to increase revenue including Northwest and higher planned outside contractor cost to support continued BOSS and virtual route management enhancement. The increases will partially offset by an efficiencies and administrative salaries as a percent of revenues.  As for our cash position for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 we spent 128 million on acquisition and 75 million on dividend an increase of 14.8%. We had 17 million of capital expenditures which was down 30% from 2016 primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with a 113.4 million in cash down 18.6% from last year. As a reminder we use all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating.  Last night the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.115 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on December11, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2017. The regular cash dividend is a 15% increase over the prior year. This marks the 15th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. We're off to a good start in the quarter to finish the year on a strong note and to successfully integrate Northwest Exterminating.  I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from [indiscernible] with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : So, can you maybe discuss how quickly will you see the organic growth accelerate because of the hurricane? And then I have a follow up. Gary Rollins : I have talked a little bit about some of the things from an entomology perspective that we will see overtime. I don\u2019t know if we ever had two storms of this magnitude back to back, Katrina I think would be the only thing that we could compare that to which John was very involved with at that point and time. So, we know from an entomology perspective we are going to see growth in the future in these areas, but I would say -- during John's prepared remarks that he talked about some of the other different activities that the operations have going on separate from what our normal pest control may be. I think the other part of that is going to be as the residences and as the businesses will get back up and running that\u2019s when our services will be needed and I don\u2019t know any of us know exactly that will look like over the coming months. Eddie Northen : I might add again it's really hard to quantify early on after these events what we have is one-time service revenue that we gain and much I talked about was that. As the areas rebuild as home owners rebuild as businesses rebuild then we start to add customers in a recurring fashion which is the organic revenue growth that we are looking for. Unidentified Analyst : And then my last question is, can you may be quantifying the impact of the deleverage of the hurricane or maybe also of the M&A, so what would margins look like [indiscernible]. Gary Rollins : We are not going to break that out. These are big competitive markets for us. So, we are not going to break that out because that would give a lot of clarity as far as our total revenue and profitability in those areas. It's well into the millions and the quarter would have looked much more normal, had we not had these storms. Operator : We will take our next question from Jamie Clement with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jamie Clement : I just wanted to be clear on what the metric was with respect to these community's cleanup activities and these kinds of things, I would have to assume that -- I would have assumed that you have 55 branches still down but are some branches still down or would you expect some residual impact from all this in the fourth quarter, I would imagine you have to right? John Wilson : Yes, I'll take that. This is John Wilson. All branches are back up and running, I'll mention the number of 55 that was the peak and that was really only a day or two or three. Our most heavily impacted branch, I would determine would be Key West Florida and so that branch is been pretty decimated, the rest are up in running and taking care of their customers as they, as they can and ready to accept our services, as you can well imagine when you have your roof torn apart, that\u2019s a much higher power taking your pest control service. So that\u2019s sort of where we are and it will be slow [bill] back to where we were. Jamie Clement : Okay and Eddie again, is the message that you know, you guys impression of the impact of this storm was it, we would have seen a Q3 very similar kind from year-over-year perspective in the growth rate and profitability that we would have seen it. In Q3, we would have seen a similar number what we saw in the first half of this year, is that kind of what we're hearing from you guys. Eddie Northen : It would have been much post to that Jamie, taking the consideration also the acquisition of Northwest and bringing that revenue on but we also, make sense that we related that as well. I think if you factor that in and net all that together, I think your statement is probably very fair. Gary Rollins : I would like to just add this, and John touched on it and it's hard to put a figure on it but based on our past experience, there will be quite a few termites what we call boosters done, where customers and non-customers will have to renew their termite barrier, the states typically send out the bulletin to the consumers that indicate that the termite barriers at risk, it's very difficult to measure that but this is again a key learning that we had from past hurricanes. John touched on the mosquito situation and we think we're going give a nice uptake in mosquitoes where we still have stand water and Houston still has standing water. And our moisture and [mildew] abetment, these homes that were flooded are going to have to have the structures treated a rest, the mold and mildew, so there is some positive if you want to look at that it comes from this, but it's very difficult for us to put a number to that. Jamie Clement : Garry I'm glad you brought that you, I do have a question about that, if a home is a [indiscernible] termite customer and the land was flooded brutally and that kind of, is it their responsibility to repay you to treat the outside of the home or do you have to go back and do it on the company\u2019s dime. Gary Rollins : No, its really the home owner's responsibility but we really do it at just about a cost basis, this is a terrible situation itself into our customers and we don\u2019t want to feel like we are preying upon it. So, they really get a tremendous benefit but as I say the state support this activity, so this isn\u2019t really something that\u2019s inappropriate, it is just obvious that if your surrounding yard is under deep little water for two days, you're going to have a deterioration of the termite barrier. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Box : apologize obviously there is a lot of questions around just on hurricane impact but I do want to drill down because you guys aren\u2019t explicitly quantifying the impact. Eddie just to go back to your comment that the quarter would have looked much more normal. I guess is it fair to assume that normal is something in the tune of about 5% organic growth and then an incremental operating margin in the tune of about 30% to 40% which is what we saw in the first half of the year? Eddie Northen : I would say as long as you are take in consideration the northwest acquisition and again expenses we have related to that and getting them -- seeing them up and running then I would say it would be much close and your staking will be very close and true. Joe Box : So, on that front I think you called that what $800,000 of incremental amortization? Eddie Northen : I believe so. Joe Box : What were the other integration expenses that we should think about? Eddie Northen : Well we had legal that was the big part of that. We had other things having to do with some compensation plans that we put in place, that we are not going to breakdown and disclose. Those are the main items. Joe Box : So, are we thinking $2 million box of Northwest items, if you would ex that out you would kind of be that incremental operating margin of 30 to 40? Eddie Northen : I think that\u2019s fair. Joe Box : Should we think about there being a cost carryover in the 4Q I think that was a good color on how the expense would work for a termite rebuild but is there any sort of cost that we should be prepared for 4Q? Eddie Northen : I don\u2019t believe so. I think that worse part is behind us to Johns point we do have a couple of branches that have been much more decimated than others, he mentioned Key West, Naples Florida was the same. But I think for the most part the rest of them are back up and running the expense that we had were the preparation for the hurricane in some cases moving vehicles closing buildings up. After the hurricane we had some building repair we had some other different things that had to go on. But I believe all of that has passed us, I don\u2019t think we are going to have any issues as of right now that we know of having to do with any of the storms. Joe Box : And then lastly for me, John can you maybe talk about the trajectory of margin improvement from installation of this new BOSS module that you are putting in place. I'm just curious if we are getting to a point where maybe we could start to see accelerating margin improvement a margin potential or is it just a steady stream of margin potential as you work through all the different modules that you are installing. Eddie Northen : Hey Joe let me jump in before John gives you some color. So, this isn\u2019t necessarily a new module this is a [audio gap] improved customer retention that\u2019s really what we are after. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Gary Rollins : Thank you for joining us. We look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter and our year end results and share accomplishments in January. In the meantime, we are wishing you and your family the best for the holidays. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

Management will make some opening remarks and then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you, Marilynn and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter and 2017 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we\u2019ll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statements we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. For the quarter revenue grew 7.5% to $414.7 million, compared to $385.6 million for the same period last year. Income before taxes rose 30.5% to $68.5 million, compared to $52.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of the new Tax Act net income declined 11.2% to $33.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to $38 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. However, without these significant tax related items net income increase 19.2% and earnings per share were up 23.5% to $0.21. Revenues for the full year grew 6.4% to $1.673 billion compared to $1.573 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 7% to $179.1 million with earnings per share of $0.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of $167.4 million or $0.77 per diluted share for the prior period. Again, without the significant tax-related items for the year, net income was a $190.7 million, up 13.9% with earnings per share of $0.87, up 13%. Eddie will review in a few minutes the specifics on the negative impact of the Tax Act to our financials for the past quarter. All of our business lines experienced good growth in the quarter with residential up 6.9%, commercial pest control grew 5% and termite and ancillary rose 15.6%. In summary, 2017 was an excellent year for our company as we continue to execute our strategic plans and goals. These are initiated to our culture of continuous improvement in all we do. We remain committed to service improvement and employee development and are accomplishing both. In the past year, we had 12 international franchises to our network as we continue to increase our presence around the world; we also advanced our acquisition strategy having added Northwest Exterminating which was discussed in our last call in several small tuck-in acquisitions. We greatly improved our routing and scheduling capabilities resulting from the implementation of BOSS and its virtual route management features. John will elaborate on this shortly. Those of you are familiar with our company know that we recognize there's always room for improvement in all we do. We will continue to raise the bar in 2018 and look forward to taking our company to the next level. I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to John Wilson, our Rollins\u2019 COO and President. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. We are pleased to report the BOSS, our branch operating system, moved to full implementation for Orkin in 2017. And with this system in place we\u2019re able to add the virtual route management software that has began to improve our technicians routing and scheduling of their customers. Many of the homes are technicians service are made of double income households, and as a result those customers expect reasonable and accurate arrival windows to accommodate their busy schedules. It is essential that our technicians are where they are supposed to be when they are supposed to be there. Scheduling is one the toughest tasks our people face due to constant and daily changes as new customers begin service or existing customers request an additional service or an appointment change. With the aid of this routing and scheduling tool we can improve delivery of our services to our customers by being there when they expect and want us to be. At the same time we are better able to build the most efficient schedules for our daily service. Further, this routing and scheduling tool has improved our miles driven which helps to offset any increase in fuel prices and vehicle-related costs. Our results today show reduction of average miles per stock by half mile. This may not sound like much until you multiply that by the more than 880,000 unique customer visits we perform each month. The 440,000 miles save both reduces wear and tear on our vehicles and saves our technicians thousands of hours of drive time. This effort also contributes to reduced accidents and lower employee turnover. But most importantly it improve our customer experience through better on-time service performance and living up to our promise of being there when we say we will be there. We will continue to move BOSS and the virtual route management capabilities forward and expect to see continued benefits during all of 2018 and beyond. For those of you that have followed the Rollins story for years you know that in 2010 we began enjoying revenue growth due to bed bugs. Since that time we have learned a lot about not only the revenue potential of this pest service, but the profitability of our offerings. Our marketing, sales and technical services groups have worked together over the past year to improve this service line and I'm pleased to announce the launch of our commercial ProAct bed bug offering. Orkin Bed Bug ProAct is an innovative proactive bed bug service developed specifically for the hospitality industry. ProAct creates an ongoing defense against bed bugs and hotel guest rooms that helps reduce the likelihood of costly bed bug infestations and lost customer revenue. The services performed by our trained specialists using residual products that create an effective barrier between service visits, which can now be scheduled as much as six months apart. The net takeaway with the ProAct in our testing is it reduces emergency service visits and hotel room downtime. We pinpointed three key benefits of ProAct that are unattainable with conventional bed bug service treatments; peace of mind, budget predictability and reputation management. 91% of hoteliers reported that they are worried about the impact of bed bug infestations. ProAct lessens the likelihood of an infestation putting their fears to rest and because ProAct is an ongoing yearly service these customers know upfront how much they would spent to prevent bed bugs, instead of on a more random case-by-case basis. Lastly, according to research, bed bugs sightings are the number one reason a guest would immediately switch hotels. And the biggest concern for hotel managers is negative word-of-mouth and reputation damage. By moving to prevent bed bug introductions from growing into an unmanageable infestation ProAct helps reduce the risk of negative online reviews and unwanted media coverage. We look forward to supporting our hospitality customers with this industry-leading service offerings scheme. I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produce record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017 was a great transition year related to technology as John mentioned and has created a platform for continued improvement at Oregon as well as our other brands. With the signing of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act law, our tax provision went through some robust Q4 changes. As mentioned in our press release, we will review our numbers from the GAAP and non-GAAP perspective for this quarter and for the full year of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million charge of which $8 million was from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million was from deferred tax asset and 700,000 was from changes in tax on stock compensation or $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income. Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. For the quarter, all of our service line showed growth and key to the quarter included a significant one-time tax event, fastest growth rate since 2008 and strong international growth and profitability in all countries. Looking at the numbers the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 billion, an increase of 7.5% of the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Income before income taxes increased 30.5% to $68.5 million from $52.5 million in 2060. In 2016 we had a one-time expense items $9 billion related to our changes in our Canadian tax company. Net income was $33.7 million, down 11.2% from $38 million in 2016 and earnings per share were $0.15 for the quarter and $0.17 in 2016. We realized a 15.8% [ph] tax rate for the quarter significantly higher than our historic 37% rate due to the Tax Act. From an non-perspective for the fourth quarter net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million with earnings per share of $0.21 versus $0.17 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter, up 23.5%. Our revenue for the 12 months of $1.673 billion represents a 6.4% growth rate. Income before taxes was $294.5 million, up 13%. And from a GAAP perspective, net income was a $179.1 million, an increase of 7%. Earnings per share were $0.82, compared to $0.77 last year, up 6.5%. This total revenue growth is our highest since 2008. From an non-GAAP perspective for 12 months net income increased to $190.7 million, up 13.9% from $167.4 million in 2016. Earnings per share were $0.87 compared to $0.77 in 2016, up 13% increase. Let\u2019s take a look at the revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 7.5% included 3.5% from several acquisitions of which Northwest Exterminating was the largest, and the remaining 4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total residential pest control which made up 41% of our revenue was up 6.9%, commercial pest control which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5%, termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 15.6%. The Northwest business contributed to this increase. Again total revenue, less acquisition was up 4%. From that residential was up 4.7%, commercial increased 3.9%, and termite and ancillary improved by 8.2%. When you take a look at the quarter taking out the impact of foreign currency in total we grew 7.5%, residential grew 6.7%, commercial pest control was up 4.3%, and termite and ancillary improves 16.2%. As we completed the year, our international operations finished on a high note with strong revenue and profit growth. In Australia our national presence and excellent service levels have enabled us to be involved in many national level tenders business. In addition to our initiatives we\u2019ve been able to standardize pricing across the country. During this past year Canada expanded margin at the fastest rate in the last several years. In the U.K the Safeguard name continues to gain recognition and has enabled them to continue a pace of significant growth. As Gary mentioned in his opening, we had 12 new international franchises to which now totals 81 at the end of 2017. Each of these operations continues to grow in maturity which enables service levels to continue to improve and recurring revenue to grow. Our participation last year at the World Pest Day and our upcoming sponsorship of the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo will continue to elevate our brand around the globe. In total gross margin was flat to last year at 50% compared to the prior year as we incorporated Northwest Exterminating into our company. We experienced good cost control increasing our gross margin inserted salaries as we continue to improve efficiency and increase productivity from our technicians with the use of BOSS. We witness improved margins and administrative salaries as cost remain relatively flat to prior year, and we reduced insurance claims as we experience reduction in legal liabilities. The gains in productivity were offset by increases in materials and supplies as we spend more on termite product with our revenue growth, fleet expenses due to gasoline price increases and leased vehicle cost. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.1 million to $14.9 million, an increase of 8.1%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with lapping of BOSS, but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.9 million decreasing 53,000 or $0.08 of a percent from last year. Amortization was $7.9 million which increased $1.1 million with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortize customer contracts resulting from the purchase of various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased $2.6 million or 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter. SG&A decreased to 29.8% of revenues compared to 32.8% for the prior year. The primary driver for the reduction was the one-time tax event to dissolve the subsidiary Kinro Investment Company in 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense increased by $9.1 million or $0.06 of a percentage point due to the one-time tax event that was offset by a credit and income tax expense. Other marginal decreases were to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel related expenses. The company experienced increased expense margin and professional services as we used outside contractors for various projects, maintenance and repair due to maintenance contracts on various IT upgrades and fleet expense. As per as our cash position for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $130.2 million on acquisitions and a $122 million on dividends, an increase of 12%. We had $24.7 million capital expenditures which was down 25.4% from 2016 primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with a $107.1 million in cash, down 25% from last year. As a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating. As mentioned in our press release we anticipate having a significantly lower tax rate for all of 2018. Our historic rate of 37% will be reduced in the mid-20s and we will see further clarity as we know more details. In addition as we saw in 2017 our first quarter 2018 rate should be reduced even further due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. At this time we do not plan to repatriate any cash, but we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunity to put this to use in our ongoing international operations and used for expansion opportunities. As far as the tax savings from the lower 2018 rate, we will continue to assess other opportunities related to our business, our shareholders and our employees. From a business perspective one way that we would use the savings will be in the area of technology projects. Based on our success in the U.S. with efficiency gains and improved routing and scheduling we\u2019ve made the decision to roll out our BOSS technology to Orkin Canada. The development and rollout will take most of 2018 and should contribute in 2019. And will be a financial event for us in either late 2018 or 2019. We will keep you posted on the impact in future quarters. We are very excited of the possibilities of BOSS that BOSS presents for us in our Orkin Canada. And finally from a shareholders perspective, last night the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on March 9, 2018, the stockholders of record at the close of business February 9, 2018. The cash dividend is a 21.7% increase over the prior year. This is the largest percent increase since 2010. And this also marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from David Polansky with Lowell, Blake & Associates. David Polansky : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hello. Gary Rollins : Yes. Hello. David Polansky : Hi. Can you hear me? Gary Rollins : Yes. Good morning, Dave. David Polansky : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you guys were seeing any pickup during the quarter from the natural disasters from Q3. And if there\u2019s any flow-through from that? Gary Rollins : Well, we know that from Q3 to Q4 we had a lot more of our customers that were up and running or had their personal situation that improved during Q4. For those that were impacted by Hurricanes and things like that when a home is either destroyed in a worst-case scenario or is greatly impacted, they\u2019re going to met our services, that\u2019s not going to be something that\u2019s a priority to them. To add those recovery efforts that continued, we continue to see more for our customers coming back to us in Q4. David Polansky : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Hey. Good morning, guys. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Joe Box : So incremental margins came in a little bit better than where they were at last quarter, but at 24% that was just a little bit below what we were thinking. Can you maybe just talk about if there was a sort of residual hurricane impact or carryover there? Or so it just be a mix factor related to taking in more termite business? Gary Rollins : Yes. Joe, I think we were pretty much done with the hurricane impacts. I would say in Q4 it wasn\u2019t really a prime situation from a weather perspective immediately a lot of areas that were shutdown and I think that impacted some things that we had to go above and beyond from a cost perspective in some areas because of that weather. And I think there was a little bit impact with that, but I'm not sure that we know exactly what the total amount that would be as far as the number that you were thinking that would be. Joe Box : I mean, I guess, was there anything else in the numbers that would have cause the incremental margin to maybe a little bit light versus high 20s, low 30s? Gary Rollins : There was nothing else this material Joe Box : Okay. And again, I know its not your practice to give guidance, but I guess, in an effort to get everybody on the same page for 1Q, should we think about the tax rate going to the mid 20s in 1Q, and then we should exclude the additional tailwind from share-based comp. What do you think that should all be lumped into together? Eddie Northen : I think for the full year 2018 we\u2019re going to be in the mid-20s and I think Q1 will be slightly better than that because of the share-based compensation. Joe Box : Do you have a sense what the share comp could be? Maybe as a percent or as a dollar value to give us a sense or no? Eddie Northen : I don\u2019t have that calculated. I\u2019m sure we can go back and look at the impact that we have for 2017. We know what\u2019s our historic rate was for 2017 and then the impact we saw in Q1 from that. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me, Joe. Joe Box : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just one more quick one if you don\u2019t mind. Can you maybe just talk about where cash taxes were in 2017 and what your expectation is then for cash tax in 2018? Eddie Northen : Again, we don\u2019t have anything broken out on that as far as any specifics are concerned. The only specifics that we\u2019ve gone through and we\u2019ve looked at has to do with our deferred tax, our foreign assets and with our pension, those are the only things that we\u2019ve broken out specifically. So I\u2019d have to get back you with any other specifics on that. Joe Box : Okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Kennedy with Nomura Instinet. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Sean. Sean Kennedy : Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On termite growth, 8% growth ex M&A is certainly impressive and I\u2019ve noticed that it's been accelerating about 100 bps per year the past few years. Is there anything strategically that management is doing to accelerate that growth overtime? Have the catalysts been success at HomeTeam? Gary Rollins : Yes. HomeTeam is going to be a part of that, Sean. But John has got some thoughts on that as well. John Wilson : Yes, Sean. Certainly termite has been accelerating, much of it is been related to our ancillary offerings. Termite demand in our industry for traditional termite services has been down over recent years, but we\u2019ve added to our line, our people -- in a real effort originally that\u2019s keep them busy and more productivity in the off seasons. But as termite demand has slowed it certainly helped us in the other seasons \u2013 other quarters as well, but that\u2019s been a huge part of it. Our ancillary offerings is really what's sort of driving some of that. Sean Kennedy : And could you call out a few of your, I guess, leading offerings? Gary Rollins : Sean, could you say it again, I was I was interrupting, sorry about that. Sean Kennedy : Sorry. No, I was just asking, could you maybe call out a couple of your leading ancillary offerings. Is that an example? Gary Rollins : Yes. So something like installation in a home that has pest offerings in it that helps you reduce the pest opportunity is an example something there. But termite as we\u2019ve talked about its not growing as fast as pest control is. But it still growing for us, but to John\u2019s point we have these other items that are also able to keep some of our termite folks more productive as they are out. So they\u2019re able to out beat the part of termite job and also have opportunities in some of these other areas as well. Sean Kennedy : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Gary Rollins : Does that help? Sean Kennedy : Yes, definitely. Gary Rollins : Great. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Gary Rollins : Rollins are excited about the opportunities for 2018 and we very much appreciate your interesting in our company and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

During the quarter, we announce the addition of four international franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. All of these locations will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite services were applicable The Orkin brand is now represented in 53 countries with 83 international franchises. In the first quarter we\u2019re also pleased to acquire two additional fine companies in the United Kingdom, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. AMES located in Birmingham has a rich history of providing superior pest control, bird control and specialty services to the commercial customers throughout the Midlands as well as London. Kestrel located in the Eastleigh, Hampshire provides commercial pest control services to customers in South Hampton and the surrounding areas of Southwest England. Kestrel will ultimately merge with our Safeguard Company. Important to us is, both of these companies share our commitment to continuous improvement in making an ongoing investment in training and employee develop. We\u2019re also pleased that the founders and the leaders of these two new companies will remain with AMES and Kestrel. As we continue to expand globally we look for external opportunities promote our brand. To that end last month we were privileged to be a gold sponsor of the Global Food Safety Initiatives, GFSI at their Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo. This is a unique annual event and brings together the leading food safety specialists from over 50 countries, dedicated to advance food safety practices. The organization addresses the entire food chain from production to consumption or as they like to say from farm to fork. This year\u2019s event had over 1,200 attendees which was a record and a number of our existing U.S. customers were represented with their international affiliates; Nestl\u00e9, ADM and Land O\u2019Lakes can name a few. We were representing two of our brands at the conference, Orkin and IFC, both leading providers of pest management services to the food industry. We believe that customer engagement is paramount to our success, and this event provided a good opportunity in this regard. Our presence at GFSI Conference provided us with a great opportunity to strengthen the relationships with existing customers and future prospects. We believe that through participation in events such as this we will continue to elevate our brand awareness around the globe. Shifting our focus to the U.S. now, we are also pleased to announce the acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky based OPC Pest Services. This leading pest control company was founded in 1972 by the late Lamon Blake and his sons Donnie and Terry Blake. I have known Donnie for a long time and have long admired the company he and his family have built. As a result of their hard work, strong customer values, and appreciation for every employee\u2019s contribution to their company, they are recognized as Kentucky\u2019s premier pest management company. We\u2019re very excited to partner with them and look forward to working together to grow our business, while sharing best practices. We were especially pleased on us last week as a result of the U.S. tax legislation. Rollins will be using part of these tax rate savings to improve our employee benefits. John will review some of these details in a minute. Additionally, we further strengthened our management team during the quarter with a promotion of three of our team members, who will be expanding their responsibilities with our company. In January, Tom Luczynski was elevated to the position of President of Orkin Global Development and International Franchises, as well as Assistant Corporate Secretary. Since 2007, Tom has presided over the Orkin International Franchising Group and has led the company\u2019s expansion to over 53 countries. In January, we also announced that Beth Chandler, Rollin\u2019s General Counsel, has been appointed to the position of Corporate Secretary. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as Vice President and General Counsel. In 2016 she assumed responsibility for the Risk Management Group. And last year the Internal Audit Group was added to Beth\u2019s responsibilities. These moves will provide dynamics between risk, legal, and internal audit. In early March we\u2019re pleased to announce that Julie Bimmerman was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Julie joined Rollins in 2015 as Managing Director of Rollins Specialty Brands Accounting and was promoted in 2016 to manage the Rollins Finance Department. Previously she had worked at HomeTeam Pest Defense, where she served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. And Julie\u2019s new role, she has added Investor Relations and Rollins Payroll Group to her areas of responsibility. Her sanctum is a good example of Rollins benefiting talent wise from these acquisitions. Our congratulations and thanks go to these three individuals for the contribution they\u2019ve made and will continue to make to our company. I will now turn the call over to John Wilson. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. Over the past few months we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes. Many companies chose to give employees one-time bonuses or similar items that provide a one-time benefit to employees. As a service company though we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset and we wanted to do something that would have a longer term effect for them and their families. We believe our benefit improvements realize that goal. Effective January 1, 2018 we improved the employee match to our 401(K) program, previously we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for contributions above 3% up to 6%. As a result of benchmarking with other service companies as well as feedback from our employee survey process, we concluded that an improvement to our paid time off policies was warranted. Adding one more floating holiday for our team members to use anyway they wish was determined to be the best way to make improvements there. Rollins has always maintained a strong commitment to education, and in that spirit we are increasing the number of scholarship opportunities by 50% for our team member\u2019s children. Each scholarship has a value of $12,000 over four years. Last, we will reward our U.S.-based team members with a one-time stock grant of stock in Rollins. These grants recognize tenure and are being given on a tier basis to employees of 2 years to 10 years or more of service. The stock is expected to be granted in May and will vest in one year. During the quarter we were also pleased to have announced that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control were awarded 2018 Top Workplaces honored by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This was the second consecutive year that Rollins has received this award and the several such awards for Northwest. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, leadership and connection. At our core we are customer service company, so our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. To quote, Jerry Gahlhoff, VP of Human Resources and President of Rollins Specialty Brands, this recognition challenges us to continually raise the bar. We must strive to improve the work environment and reinforce our culture as we continue to build on our tradition of success. We\u2019re also pleased for Rollins to have been recognized by Training Magazine as the Top 125 Training Company. For 12 years Rollins has been recognized with \u2013 excuse me, for 12 years Orkin has been recognized with this honor. This latest award recognizes all of the Rollins Corporation for the quality, commitment, and investment in training our people. According to the Training Magazine, the Training Top 125 ranking is based on a number of benchmarking statistics and is determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, including financial investment and employee development, the scope of development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to the business goals and objectives. Thank you. And we\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company. As we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and as John reviewed, we\u2019re making industry leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we recognized the difference they make each and every day. The quarter\u2019s organic growth has been in line with our historic norm, but our overall revenue improvements have been strongly fueled by good quality acquisitions. During the first quarter alone we had 16 acquisitions for a total of over $40 million. These acquisitions enable us to continue to become more efficient in our business model and will produce sustain growth for years to come. There are only two other times in our company\u2019s history that we have seen M&A play such a critical part of our growth, the acquisition of Orkin in 1964 and the acquisition of HomeTeam in 2008. I think we would all agree that these have been \u2013 that these have worked out extremely well for Rollins. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and highlights included, enhancements to our employee benefits program that John discussed, a significant increase in amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions, and the strongest commercial revenue growth in the past five years. Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $408.7 million was an increase of 8.9% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter revenue of $375.2 million. Income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $59.2 million from $57.3 million in 2017. Net income rose 20.5% to $48.5 million, and earnings per share increased 22.2% to $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. There are two unusual items that impacted the profit numbers compared to the average quarter. As we noted in our press release last week, the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by roughly $0.01 and was equated to about $2.3 million. And we would anticipate a similar impact in quarters to come for the remainder of the year. This is a tremendous use of our portion of our tax savings as John stated we invest in our greatest asset, our people. Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization for intangible assets for the quarter by 40.8% which is the highest percent increase since we purchased HomeTeam in 2008. As a comparison over the past five years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been above 5.1%. Compared to last year this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by a $0.01 or roughly $2 million after tax. And importantly, indicates a tremendous investment for our future. If you exclude these two items that are unusual, our income before taxes would have been 10.9% improvement year-over-year and income after taxes would have risen 31.2%. Let\u2019s take a look through the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increased 8.9% included 4.2% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest was the largest and the remaining 4.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total residential pest control which made up 40% of our revenue was up 8.4%. Commercial pest control which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5.6%. And termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 19% of our revenue was up 16.2%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over more than the last five years, but this first quarter displayed the fastest growth that has occurred during this recent time period. Our commercial sales team continues to improve through a better selection process of people, enhanced training and continued improvements to our key technologies, namely BizSuite, our customer facing iPad presentation tool. Our commercial operations are performing at the highest levels in the industry, and we see this through retention and new sales, especially in the areas \u2013 the segment areas of hospitality, property management and restaurants. We look forward to continue success in this area. Again total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.7%, and from that residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 4.5%, and termite improved 4.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies in currency, in total we grew 8.8%, residential grew 8.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.5%, and termite and ancillary improved 16.8%. In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 49.6% for the quarter. The costs related to the enhanced employee benefit impacted the first quarter by 1 percentage point. Additionally, administrative expense was higher with the addition of our multiple acquisitions as well as increasing fleet expenses as gasoline costs were up an average of $0.25 per gallon compared to last year. The quarter benefited from improved efficiencies, and routing and scheduling technology which reduced miles per vehicle by 5% and also helped to lower service salaries as a percent of revenue. Insurance and claims were lower than prior year as a percent of revenue as we\u2019ve reduced our litigated exposure. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $3.1 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 22.8%. Depreciation increased $300,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases. And as mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets increased $2.8 million related to customer contracts included in various acquisitions which reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.01 after taxes. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $11.1 million or 9.8% to 30.9% of revenues, up 0.2 of a percentage point, from 30.7% for the first quarter last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to higher administrative salaries and personnel related expenses due to acquisitions, and fleet costs due to increased gasoline price. The increases were partially offset by lower insurance, and claims expense due to reduced exposure in litigation. As for our cash position for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we spent $43.1 million on acquisitions compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year, and $30.6 million on dividends an increase of 22%. We had $6.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 12.5% from 2017 primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $84.3 million in cash, down 48.1% from last year. But as a reminder, we use all cash for our acquisition to both, Northwest Exterminating and OPC. As we mentioned on our Q4 call, we anticipate a significantly lower tax rate for 2018. Our Q1 rate of 18% will be the lowest of the year and we anticipate a rate in the mid-20% for the remainder of the year. As a reminder the Q1 rate is lower due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2018. This is a 22% increase over the prior year and marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, everybody. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : So one of your competitors recently highlighted at the lay in the spring pest season that\u2019s having a negative impact on their first quarter result, I\u2019m curious that the unseasonably cold spring have an impact on your revenue growth at all. It doesn\u2019t look like it did given the strong organic growth in the quarter, but I\u2019m just curious if there was any impact there in the first quarter, and then any anticipated impact on the second quarter given the cold April that we\u2019ve had. Gary Rollins : We were \u2013 certainly we were impacted primarily due to the snowfall. The National Weather Service measures snowfall in the top 35 markets and it was up over 30%. So the snowfall and weather also affect demand, but they affect our ability to get around the service or customer, so certainly we\u2019re impacted. Certainly I can\u2019t say anything about the quarter. The second quarter, other than I\u2019ve been in the business for 50 years and we always have a season, it drives you crazy when it starts off like this, but we have no doubt that the pest season will arrive. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, okay, thank you. Just tell me guys that \u2013 Eddie Northen : I\u2019m sorry. Tim Mulrooney : Go ahead. Eddie Northen : Yes. This is Eddie. So just to add on to that, we try our best, I mean, you\u2019re spot on as far as it impacting actually what\u2019s going on, but we try our best to take that away. And John and team do a tremendous job, continuing to hold the sales folks and the operations accountable. So just one of the ways to grow and to make sure you retain your customers and you are servicing them even above and beyond is the great service that they normally get, to make sure that we don\u2019t have them and we will reduce our turnover the best that we can to take that out of the picture. But obviously when the weather does get better, and it is going to get warmer to Gary\u2019s point, we hope to benefit from that as well. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, got it, Eddie, thank you. Maybe one more from me, did you say that VRM helps reduce miles driven by 5%? John Wilson : So miles driven per vehicle is the measure that we reviewed. So we\u2019ve got the Orkin brand on our Virtual Route Management tool as I think that you know and this was part of an offset for our increase of the fleet expense overall. By reducing our miles we were able to reduce our gallons used and improve our time in front of the customer or our technicians. So we\u2019re seeing the maturity come to bear some good fruit for us. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. I think last quarter you said you were saying a benefit, your vehicle \u2013 miles per vehicle by about 0.5 mile. Is that consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter? I\u2019m just trying to compare it and see if there was any incremental benefit as the system matures and you get better at rerouting and everything? John Wilson : Yes, I\u2019m not sure if we can use the previous quarter and this quarter and kind of extrapolate out from there. I would just say that the maturity continues to pay dividends for us. We\u2019ve really concentrated on making sure that we\u2019re improving our on-time delivery and part of that has been the use of routing and scheduling and optimizing these routes. And our operations have really done a tremendous job. It really, really almost throughout the entire U.S. and we\u2019ve got 500 branches and almost everyone is at the mark that we wanted to be at or significantly higher. So we\u2019re reaping the benefits of that and we know we\u2019ve got more opportunities as this moves forward. Gary Rollins : One benefit that we have to look forward to is putting our routing and scheduling in all of our brands. Currently we don\u2019t have it in all of the brands and I guess [indiscernible] went up. So, you know, we should be able to have similar benefits as we roll it out to other brands. Eddie Northen : And Tim, other byproduct that we see of this as we continue to have a better on-time delivery of services as John\u2019s group continues to do that, our customers are going to respond more positively to that. So having the right technician on the right day at the right time at the customer\u2019s location, because they\u2019re running this route correctly saves us miles, but also puts that right technician in the right spot and we have a better customer experience because of that. Tim Mulrooney : Yes, okay, I got it. Well, congrats on a great quarter and thanks for taking my question. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Kennedy with Nomura. Sean Kennedy : Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a strong start of the year and thank you for taking my questions. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes, thanks, Sean. Sean Kennedy : Yes, I was wondering was there anything else that affected the strong commercial growth of 4.5% ex-M&A? And do you think this rate can be sustained? Eddie Northen : Well, I\u2019ll say that \u2013 I\u2019m sure John can talk about the operational side of that, but from the sales side of that, the three keys that I talked about the continual improvement of the individuals that we are bringing on from a sales perspective; having them use the technology almost without exception is helping us in front of the customer. And then the service that John and team are providing to the customer, they\u2019re not turning over, they\u2019re staying with us at a higher rate and it\u2019s giving us something for our sales force to be able to sell better. As we talk about the industry in whole \u2013 as a whole, unequivocally we have by far the best commercial service that\u2019s out there. And I think that some of our customers are seeing that, that they may have had service with someone else that is out there, they\u2019re seeing the difference in the service that John and team are providing. John Wilson : Yes, Sean, thank you for the question. I don\u2019t think I want to add to what Eddie had just said would be that our National Councils team just had a terrific quarter with a 60% sales increase year-over-year. And so the question is will that sustain, that\u2019s hard to keep doing quarter-after-quarter. But I think with the added emphasis and focus those guys have on getting out of hunting up customers has helped tremendously. So in addition to field based sales effort that Eddie referenced, our National Councils group did a great job and I shout out to them for that. Eddie Northen : And Sean, Gary opened with talking about some of the international piece of our business. And we know today that\u2019s not a big part of our business that\u2019s growing. But things like this Global Food Safety Conference; it puts us in a position to be able to have a wider or more global approach. And as more customers come to us and they\u2019re looking for a global solution, we\u2019re in 53 countries and we have opportunities to be able to service from a global perspective. So in some cases from an RFP perspective, that\u2019s going to knock out a lot of others that don\u2019t have that global reach. So as we continue to spend time and energy there, I think that\u2019s going to pay more positive dividends for us and give us more opportunity. Sean Kennedy : Okay, great. I have one more. Can you comment on how the tuck-in acquisitions in North America like Northwest and OPC over the past year will affect operating margins like in the medium- to long-term? Specifically, how much will the added density affect the margin opportunity at Rollins? Eddie Northen : So I\u2019ll break that question down. So when we talk about \u2013 when we think about tuck-in acquisitions we think about 10 to 12 to 15 technicians that we are able to take and put into an existing, say, Orkin brand or an existing HomeTeam brand based on whatever, wherever they are. And at that point in time we are able to tremendously positively improve the efficiency; the density becomes better overnight, so all of those things get better when we have a tuck-in acquisition. For us in total this quarter we have 16 total acquisitions, and I would say, 12 to 13 of those were relatively tuck-in acquisitions. However, the others, the names that you mentioned there, such as a Northwest or an OPC, we run those as standalone brand. We see the value in the company that we bought and we typically buy companies that are growing at a faster rate than our overall growth rate, which both Northwest and OPC are. And frankly, they\u2019re doing a good job, doing what they\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re just going to share with them the benefits of opportunities and services, the buffet of opportunities and services that we have as an organization, we want to learn from them, we want to steal their good people like we\u2019ve done with Julie, bringing her onto our team, such as we have with Jerry Gahlhoff bring him on to our team to do more. So there\u2019s a lot of other things that happen with that. But as far as the density, and efficiency, and improvement in margin, other tuck-in acquisitions are going to continue to be able to provide that opportunity. Did that \u2013? Sean Kennedy : Yes, yes, definitely. But do you also put kind of the Rollins machine, the BOSS and VRM? Will you overlay that on, say, Northwest and OPC businesses? Eddie Northen : Yes. I think that\u2019s absolutely \u2013 the radar is going to move forward in time. And we\u2019ll go through each one of those, we\u2019ll see what they have in place and see what makes sense as far as routing and scheduling in their individual company. And if they have a product that is already working well for them and they figure out what makes sense as far as they used to catch from there. As Gary and John just mentioned, Orkin Canada is next for us and we\u2019ve already started down that path of that, which is going to make a lot of sense for us. And we think we\u2019re going to have a good opportunity there. But these other brands that you mentioned will continue to assess those and we will figure out where the best place is for us to spend our time and energy and see improvement. Sean Kennedy : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Good luck with the rest of the year. Eddie Northen : Yes, thank you for that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Eddie Northen : Yes. If there\u2019s no other questions, we will go ahead and we\u2019ll wrap up. I\u2019m sorry Operator : We have one. Eddie Northen : We have one more, okay. Yes. Operator : That\u2019s correct. We have \u2013 our next question comes from Jamie Clement with Buckingham. Jamie Clement : Hey, gentleman, good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Jamie Clement : Gary, I was wondering if I could get your long-term perspective here. Seems like more family-owned businesses have come to market, it sounds like more perhaps on the way. It\u2019s not \u2013 at least my opinion is it\u2019s not as if the industry fundamentals have deteriorated. What do you think is going on? Is this just a question of family, legacy and financial planning and that kind of thing? Why they increase? Gary Rollins : Well, I think that if we just look over, show over at the most recent ones, there\u2019s family dynamics that are involved. Some of the family members want the money and some want to continue to work. We\u2019ve been very fortunate that we\u2019ve been able to keep a lot of the principles and the leaders with the company, their company. This just got more complicated and it requires a heavy investment in IT, a heavy investment in digital, in the Internet. And some of the companies are really kind of frightened by that. As it becomes more sophisticated you\u2019ve got to rely more on technology and I think that\u2019s a turning point. I think the values that are getting today versus two years ago, they\u2019re getting more module. So that\u2019s been motivating some of the people that when they see the market improved as far as that user concern. If they are on offense that\u2019s kind of the knowledge that takes place to cause them to consider disposing of the business and we\u2019ve got one for reputation and that people stay with us, and that\u2019s not the case. And most of the other folks that we\u2019re competing with, the retention of our people they acquire the promotions of the acquired are getting. It has really I think driven a lot of these great companies and interaction. We\u2019re fortunate there. Jamie Clement : A quick follow-up. And Eddie, I don\u2019t know if you want to take this. Just on multiples, I mean, obviously, over the last couple of years we saw some big commercial just go with very high multiples. I kind of think that what you\u2019re paying is not outside of your historical range all that much, right. Eddie Northen : I would agree with your statement. I think Gray\u2019s point is as companies hear about multiples that some other companies are paying, it will be getting them to think about, okay, maybe this is the time, maybe this is something for us to think about. And as they learn more about do I go after that biggest check or do I go after an opportunity to be able to take my business and partner with somebody who had done this for a long time and lives up to their word, and that\u2019s when we win, it\u2019s the latter one. We\u2019re not going to necessarily be the one to write the biggest check, but we are going to live up to our work and we\u2019re going to keep people on that that we say we\u2019re going to keep on and we\u2019re going to have them continue to run the business. Gary and Mr. Rollins have a track record of that for 50 years. And I think that\u2019s a reason why people continue to come back to us over and over again and say, you\u2019re the choice for us. For us this quarter 16 acquisitions, I think that\u2019s just a testament to exactly how companies look at that. Jamie Clement : Okay, terrific. Thank you all for the additional color, I appreciate it. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to updating you on our second quarter and our progress on the next call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your phone lines, and thank you for joining us this morning.",

Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We\u2019re very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, our revenues grew 10.8% to 480.5 million compared to 433.6 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 21.1% to 65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to 53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to 889.2 million compared to 808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% to approximately 113.6 million with earnings per share at $0.52 per diluted share compared to 94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year. We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control rose 6% and Termite & Ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the expansion that we continue to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made two significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002 and is a well-recognized for its pest control services, legionella disease control and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the UK\u2019s midlands. This acquisition, our fourth in the UK, will help us to expand our footprint within this country. As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone, having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare, our first company owned acquisition in Singapore. Founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for its superior pest control and specialty services to both residential and commercial customers. In selecting to partner with Rollins, founders John Ho and Patrick Chong shared that it has taken them 3 years to find a company that had the same business philosophy that they had. Both of our company's share a commitment to quality service and care for our employees. We're most pleased that Patrick Chong will remain in a leadership role and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with the goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore. The landmark acquisition expands our residents now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on this acquisition. We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees, resulting from the tax related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you look around, we granted Rollins\u2019 stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a one-time charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complemented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam is receiving for the 7th time in a row, David Weekley\u2019s highly coveted Partners of Quality award. David Weekley Homes is the largest privately held builder in the country, implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform as a way to measure world class lender excellence. And to demonstrate their commitment to partner with our suppliers, believing that when a partner improves his relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes at 13 cities where they conduct this. This award confirms HomeTeam\u2019s commitment to providing exceptional service to its business partners. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. I\u2019m often asked about whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continue to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures hit their lowest, our applicant flow remained comparable to 2017 levels as well. That said, we recognize a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and pre-employment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement around these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer. Most importantly, it allows us to review hard and ultimately choose well. One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call, an observation day, where the candidate spends time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps a candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with co-workers and their likelihood to fit into the team. This additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. One other added benefit of taking the time for the observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active during the process and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates. 4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years and we\u2019ve put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I am happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the 5th year being completed. At the end of last year, we also hired a human resources consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile in compensation with comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on a previous earnings call, we were evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making any ill advised decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their on-boarding experience. We found out we weren\u2019t always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customers happy. In late 2017, we implemented new on-boarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day one and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly. By making these changes based on this survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our on-boarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members, we have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly, treat them well. There are certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor market is tight, we're continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent. Following up Gary\u2019s remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team at Aardwolf played a major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With the strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, Aardwolf shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. Gary mentioned that Patrick Chong remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We wish John Ho well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely, with the historic revenue growth rate that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. While M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned, the remaining 5.4% organic growth rate drove the need for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts, up and running with a quality service. Our financial results continue to show the impact of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past six months, as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvement in the future. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and keys to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth, substantial increase in depreciation and amortization, as a result of multiple acquisitions and thirdly, fleet expense increase, which was impacted by lease cost and a significant increase in fuel price per gallon. Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of 480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter revenue of 433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to 90.2 million from 86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to 65.5 million and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. As we discussed last quarter, there were two unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter, as they will continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefit that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about a penny due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the one-time stock grants to many of our US based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisition, which has increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past five years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by a penny and is a tremendous investment for our future. With our strong increase in pest control revenue generated, there is an aspect of our business that we have not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to start-up costs for new recurring businesses. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sales commissions and labor costs, all of which falls in the first month of service with only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment need such as rodent trap, fly lights and base station, just to name a few. The time to get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduced the profit contribution for the first three to four visits. Once we are at that four to five visit level, the profitability significantly improved and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come. Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt that this was a timely discussion for us to have. A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2, our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norm. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that one time revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rate, this investment will pay dividends for years to come. Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue was up 6% and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past five years, but as I\u2019ve mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4% and from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total, we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. In total, gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% in prior year\u2019s quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around route optimization to our virtual route management system continues to see improvement and partially offsets the fuel increase. The second quarter and specifically June revealed the best improvement in stops per mile since we completed our rollout of the virtual route management system in 2017. Fleet expenses in total increased 3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mention and leased vehicle expense. Personnel related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased 2.8 million to 16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%.  Depreciation increased 936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased 1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down one-tenth of a percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower salaries, which increased slower than revenue and reduced professional services, as we wrapped up various projects. As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent 14.2 million on acquisition compared to 11.2 million the same quarter last year, as we continue to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year and 61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. We had 14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with 87.9 million in cash, of which 40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest bearing account at various domestic banks. There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated a process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time allotted will take the next 16 to 18 months, for which the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising and pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward. On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Before I turn the call over to Gary, I'd like to ensure that you are all aware of our Analyst/Investor Day on August 10 at the New York Stock Exchange, recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rollins, as a publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. Gary, John, Julie and I will be giving an update on several parts of our business as we see them today and moving forward. Gary, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you. We\u2019re happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jamie Clement with Buckingham. Jamie Clement : Eddie, if I can start with you if you don't mind. Typically, you guys don't talk about, on a quarterly basis, the difference between growth in recurring revenue versus organic growth. And I think based on the numbers you gave, the recurring number I think was like 2X that would be already pretty strong organic growth. So what exactly is the difference there? Because like generally speaking, if I think about you adding a commercial customer, I consider that recurring and if you sign a residential customer to a one year contract, I'd also consider that recurring, so what's the difference there? Eddie Northen : Well, the reason why we\u2019re pointing this out is because our profitability really begins after that third or fourth visit. Yeah. So, the first visit, the first, second and third visit, if it\u2019s a commercial account, we\u2019re setting up all this equipment, we\u2019re setting up the base stations, we\u2019re setting up the rodent trap, we\u2019re learning the customer and by that fourth to fifth visit is really when all of that is behind us, the expense of all that is behind us and that\u2019s when the profitability really improves rapidly. To a lesser degree, we'll still see that on the residential side. We may have sales commissions that may be a part of that new residential sale or we may also have a learning curve with the new consumer as well. So we were just pointing out with the rapid growth on the organic side, that\u2019s a little bit different than what we've seen in the historical kind of regulated -- regular organic growth that we\u2019ve seen think. Jamie Clement : And then on the investments that you all have made this year into your employees, I think, you said it was about a penny for the second quarter. I think you said it was about a penny for the first quarter too. Am I right about that? Eddie Northen : That\u2019s correct. Jamie Clement : I was little unclear, should that impact goal would be the same in Q3 and Q4 or should that go down because you've already given out the stock. Eddie Northen : It will be slightly less than we began the amortization, we\u2019ll have a slightly less amount of amortization in Qs 3 and Q4. So it will probably, to your point, I\u2019ll probably round down slightly less than a penny. Jamie Clement : Would it also be fair to say that based on John's comments about hiring more folks and that kind of thing, I mean, I would imagine that your technicians are more profitable, all else being equal after they\u2019ve been on the job. I don\u2019t know what the right number is, 9 months, 12 months, than when they just start. So if you\u2019re adding a bunch of new business and you\u2019re adding new employees, you sort of get a little bit of a double whammy that, right and it's temporary, right? Eddie Northen : That\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to have the training expense, you\u2019re going to have obviously hiring expense when you're hiring more people as we're able to grow this revenue as well as we're able to grow. And that\u2019s part of the reason why John talked a couple of quarters ago about the on boarding process and making sure that we're doing the right things to move that retention in the right direction and why we wanted to follow up on that on this quarter. Do you have anything else to add to that, John? John Wilson : Yes. Jamie, in some markets, depending on regulatory requirements, it takes us 90 days to get a new person on the street and producing revenue, sort of taking care of customer. So, you're absolutely right. The longer therefore, the more profitable and the better that is. In addition, costs, some number, anywhere from $5000 to $10000, just to source and hire new employees. So it's a pretty expensive proposition upfront but that's why we want to put so much effort into sourcing right, hiring right and retaining those people. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : So the gross margin contracted, I think, 80 basis points in the quarter, which was a little bit more than what we were expecting, how much of this was related to stronger organic growth, on boarding new customers as you discussed in your prepared remarks and how much of this was the impact from recent acquisitions? Eddie Northen : Yeah. So I would say the organic growth was probably from a weighted average perspective, was probably the larger piece of that that we have, more employees are spending a little bit more time on those new customers as we added them so rapidly over these last two quarters. But then fleet it also a piece of that as well, but the fuel price is up on average, $0.39 per gallon and then our -- and our lease vehicle cost is up. So as we're adding these new customers and this new revenue and we're adding new employees, we have had additional vehicle lease expense as well. So those were two of the key items that really made that impact that you mentioned. Tim Mulrooney : And then secondly, on international expansion. I mean with some of the recent acquisitions, you've expanded your presence in the UK, now Singapore. You guys have leading positions in Canada and Australia as well. Could you just talk about the international pest landscape? I mean, are there any other large international markets where maybe you have a smaller presence today, but they have a large TAM maybe right for consolidation or further investment in the future and are these mostly in Europe or are there others in Asian and South American markets as well for example. Eddie Northen : There's significant growth opportunities in lesser developed countries. The growth rates that we see in places like Southeast Asia and in China through our franchise groups, the growth rate there is significantly higher. To your point in Europe, there are some very mature markets that are larger markets that are out there and we\u2019ll continue to be able to go through and take a look at different countries where, at this point in time, probably going to continue to still take a look at countries, where we understand the language, we understand the culture, it is a business environment we clearly understand, but we're going to continue to use these franchises to be able to know and understand these markets as we're growing and we\u2019re moving forward, especially in these higher emerging opportunity, countries that are out there.  And it is a formula that's worked very well for us. I mean, the franchise group in total, the International Franchise group has grown significantly faster than our overall company\u2019s growth rate. Now, of course, we only have the royalties portion of that from a financial perspective. But it gives us an opportunity to be able to know and understand the footprint and the opportunities that are out there around the rest of the globe. So, we feel good with Australia moving forward the way that it has and developing that landscape, starting there in 2014 and then adding new countries in 2016, the UK and now 2018, in Singapore. It's been a good cadence for us, first to be able to digest that and learn and understand more about those parts of the world and we\u2019re excited about what that future looks like. John Wilson : Yeah. And Tim, I would just add. This is John Wilson by the way. I would just add that while we're excited about the opportunity, there's tons of opportunity in the countries that we've already expanded in and as you've got well no density, it\u2019s really important to our businesses and so building out the footprint and the service capabilities of the countries that we're in already is real important to us improve in those businesses. So we're looking at opportunities and always interested, but I think my first priority is to take care of what we -- expand what we have I guess. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sean Kennedy with Nomura. Sean Kennedy : So I had another question that\u2019s concerning the M&A, specifically the increase in M&A in recent years. I was wondering if there was a specific strategy behind the accelerating M&A over the last year, especially in mid to high valuations and competition for deals in the industry. Was decrease in taxes a factor? Eddie Northen : I will answer the last piece of that. Our model, the decrease in taxes helped with the model when we take a look at it, but I would not say that that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family of brands that maybe aren\u2019t necessarily looking for that biggest check and then happier company broken up. They\u2019re looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand and be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there.  We\u2019ve see that through the relationship that Gary and John and our other senior management folks have developed over the years that we continue to have these folks come to the table or come to us and in a lot of cases, we\u2019re the only ones at the table. For the last two major deals that we did, it was not a situation of a bidding process. So the valuation that other companies are paying, we're not a part of that. It's more important that whole legacy piece and continuing to keep those good quality companies and employees and being able to go through and finally get to that. And one of the key things and the most important thing to us, if you hear us talk about over and over is our company culture. And when someone else is selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employee is, in a lot of cases, a driving decision. For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they told us that was the number one thing that made their decision for Rollins.  And as John talked about, it took them over three years to make their decision, but when they found us and learned about us and they found out more about our culture and who we are and what the company thinks about our employees and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now, if they had chosen someone else where they had been a different price tag for them, it\u2019s a possibility that that could have been the case, but the culture piece was really the most important part for them and we continue to see that with many, many opportunities that are out there from an acquisition perspective. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Brian Butler : This is actually Brian Butler for Michael today. Just to swing back on the international piece, in the markets -- the new markets are kind of in. Can you give a little color on the relative margins of where they are now versus kind of where the company is and what the opportunity is once you kind of get that density in those markets? Eddie Northen : We don't break any margins down by any of our geographic areas. When we get an opportunity to be able to add density into a country such as we were able to do in Australia, things obviously move in the right direction, because we have one set of leadership that's going to be in place or the country. And as we were able to go through and add our third and our fourth and our fifth and sixth companies there, we're able to go through it and use that more efficiently. We're also able to be able to use our purchasing power at the company typically to be able to go through and enhance the margin in these existing countries and companies that we're buying. Our purchasing power for material and supplies and for vehicle and all those types of things as well as benefits in a lot of cases is a very positive thing what will impact the overall margin, but we'll break those out, but we'll have opportunities to be able to see how we can help our overall company's margin go forward when we add acquisition, not just internationally, but domestically as well. Brian Butler : Okay. Without getting I guess into the detail of what the margins are, just kind of what that range is in the sense of, when you add that density, does that add 100 basis points of improvement or is it -- just trying to look at a relative kind of, what the impact of those additional acquisitions are. Eddie Northen : So when we acquire a company depending on what's already in place, we can typically pick up 4 to 5 margin points, when we go through and we strip out cost that we would not need to continue to run the company when we use our purchasing power as I just talked about, when we use our vehicle leases, when we put them on our benefit. And if there are opportunities to be able to create further synergies from there, whether it\u2019s back office or whether it is their management structure, we're able to sometimes do better than that. But we're able to use our tools typically to be able to make them better. A great example would be when we acquired Critter Control and they really didn\u2019t have a very strong Internet presence. So we were able to go through and use our marketing group to be able to help them further develop and improve their revenue stream in a more efficient manner that enabled us to be able to improve the margins there. So having our structure in place just enabled us to be able to provide that. [Technical Difficulty] Brian Butler : Switching over to the new customer, how long is it typically between the first and fourth visit? Eddie Northen : It will depend on what kind of customer it is. So if it is a residential customer, let\u2019s just say it is in every other month customer that we have, which is our most frequent visit, that third visit, you can help through the math there, so every other month times three visit is what we would be looking at. And then on the commercial side, I think the average of averages and I'm going to say that because you have some that, some customers revisit twice a week and some customers, we might have quarterly, the average of averages will probably be about a month. So now we're talking about that two to three month time period for the average of averages to be able to go through and -- Gary Rollins : Yeah, I think that's right. Six to eight months for a residential customer and for that third or fourth visit and three times in the quarter for the commercial. Eddie Northen : And that's the reason why our retention rate, leading the industry is such an impactful item for us as far as profitability is concern, with residential, retention rates well into the '80s and commercial in the high 80, that's what really helped with that profitability. We keep those that are profitable over a long period of time. Brian Butler : Okay, great. And then on the SG&A side, I mean that kind of tracked with revenues from a growth perspective, it was up a similar amount. Looking forward, once you kind of anniversary some of the compensation changes you've made, is this -- what kind of leverage do you get on the SG&A side? I would expect it to be slower than revenue typically. Eddie Northen : Well, so we'll definitely see leverage, this quarter was impacted by the enhanced benefit that we had for our employees. So if you kind of take that out, it\u2019s kind of a one-time type of event, we would have seen a further improvement on the SG&A. But as we move through time, as we continue to streamline with the acquisition and one of the things that we're able to do is we're able to sometimes pull in back office support into a more consolidated environment and help reduce the overall cost. Those numbers should continue to move in a positive direction for us. Brian Butler : Okay. And this is the last one. Was there anything seasonally about the second quarter unusual that contribute to any of the margin headwind there or was this fairly typical second quarter? Eddie Northen : I don't know if there's ever. You all will have to help me. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s ever a typical second quarter. In April, it was still a little bit cool. In May and June, it warmed up and every year that cycle looks maybe a little bit different, but like I said, that organic growth rate really moves forward very, very positively, the recurring growth rate has really moved forward very, very positively. And we just hope to continue to be able to see that as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company. Chris McGinnis : Just have two quick kind of follow-ups. Just quickly around the acquisitions, obviously, in Q1, I think you highlighted 16 smaller acquisitions, I guess obviously given the number, was there a number for Q2 that I missed, I may have missed that, if I did, I apologize. Eddie Northen : I don't know if I have that exact number off the top of my head. It was somewhere around 4, 5. I think in total, we\u2019ve got somewhere in around 20. I think I did mention the dollar amount that we had that we deployed this year versus last year as well. Chris McGinnis : And then just quickly on the increase in the fuel, is there any way to kind of offset that other than route out the optimization, is there a pricing mechanism, would that increase, just a little color around that would be helpful? Thanks. Eddie Northen : We've really analyzed a hedge type of a situation and at this point in time, just isn\u2019t really some expense for us to be able to look at that. Gasoline, in total, specifically has been somewhere between 3% and 4% in total. So to pick a chance of that, and being on the wrong side of that, we\u2019ve not made a decision, we\u2019ve made a decision not to do that at this point in time. Our real effort is around our routing scheduling and our route optimization and we have a lot of very, very good opportunity for us in that area as we move forward, not just in or chem, but in some of our other brands as well that have made some good improvement in the routing and scheduling piece.  So anything that we can do to continue to reduce our miles per stock, which we are in June with our best month we\u2019ve had since the inception of this program, we continue to move that forward. That\u2019s going to offset some of that fuel increase. And we're just not smart enough to be able to bet on almost every another on where that price per gallon is going to go as we move forward in time. So we\u2019re going to do the parts that we can do and that\u2019s making the routes more optimized and be able to reduce the miles that way.

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well, we're very pleased to report our 50th consecutive quarter of improved revenue in earnings. Revenues for the quarter grew 8.3% to $487.8 million, compared to $450.4 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.6% to $52.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share compared to $51.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the first nine months rose 9.3% to $1.376 billion, compared to $1.259 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 24.3% to approximately $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.83 compared to $105.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share for the same period last year. We expect good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter with the residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 5.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. On August 10, we are privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, the 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The anniversary was significant in both a business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins and Lead Director Henry Tippie rang the closing bell and in doing so made history at the Exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only two directors present for our company's initial listing in its 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. We're fortunate to have their contribution and leadership for that period as well. As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as an exhibit in experienced square [ph] in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins Heritage Center such as our World War II era horse-drawn wagon and a bicycle that Orkin technicians used to provide service when gasoline was rationed. We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like Western, Waltham, Critter Control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we unveiled some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this suite [ph] at commercial iPad application. We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we've made over the past 50 years. Since acquiring Orkin in the 1964, we have grown from a few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company with more than 700 operations in 57 countries. In the early 90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry were, Rollins narrowed its focus on pest control and sold all of our non-pest control businesses. We then began to open new Orkin branches, created Orkin franchises both domestic and international and initiated an acquisitions strategy, all of which remains the same today. Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, Waltham and at 2008, HomeTeam Pest Defense which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we were able to grow and improve. Other acquired international companies followed in Australia, the United Kingdom and recently Singapore. During this time, we also realized that there were segments of the pest control industry in the U.S. that would complement our growth strategy. We added to our portfolio Industrial Fumigation, the largest commercial pest control fumigation company in the United States, Trutech and later acquiring the master franchise or the best-known U.S. wildlife brand, Critter Control. By the way, today, we're the country's largest wildlife control company. Our acquisitions strategies has continued most recently with the purchase of Northwest Exterminating and Kentucky's [ph] OPC Pest Control company. None of these successes would have been possible without our people who have been the central part of Rollins' past and present accomplishments. I never grow tired of saying and recognizing that our employees are our company's most precious asset. Our team's dedication and experience shaped not only who we are today, but will direct what we will do in the future. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve all of our existing businesses while at the same time expanding our global footprint through new locations and acquisitions. Let me now turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. As you all know in September, two, where the large hurricanes hit the U.S. mainland, Hurricane Florence in the middle of the month, came ashore near Right [ph] Beach North Carolina. The storm stalled and the most of the damage there was done by flooding. Hurricane Michael was a larger category 4 storm that destroyed Mexico beach and parts of Panama City Beach Florida. I am happy to report that all of our team members were accounted for and our office facilities came through mostly okay. Hurricane Michael was the most impactful as it relates to our team. I know of four families that have lost everything and at least six others with significant loss due to the storm. I spoke with our Orkin region manager for that area on Thursday. He was on-site and working to help both our team and our customers get back on their feet. Of course, we have also engaged our Rollins Employee Relief Fund team in support of these folks and others. You may recall on our second quarter conference call, I discussed the tight labor market and how competition for employees was impacting us. At that time, our brands were handling it fairly well. Since then with the unemployment rate having declined to 3.7% in September, we're experiencing some hiring pressures. We still maintain high retention rates for our industry, but it has become even more important for our people to recruit for new talent consistently in order to maintain a viable pipeline of new team member candidates. As Gary just mentioned, we regard our employees as our most important asset and we continue to assess and act upon what is working; what we need to do to adjust in any additional steps we can take to ensure we will remain the employer of choice. A good step directed toward retaining our employees was the decision to share a portion of the U.S. tax savings in the form of stock grants and in improved 401(k) match for our U.S.-based employees. To further support our hiring efforts, we have beefed up our recruiting initiatives and we will be rolling out our first ever human resource or HRIF system in 2019. Our president of specialty brands and human resources Jerry Gahlhoff is the executive sponsor and leads this initiative. This will enable us to better track training, performance and career development for all employees around the globe in one seamless location. All the groups that will benefit greatly from this will be our current and future leaders as people development is an important part of this effort. Our focus on hiring veterans and females continues to provide significant opportunity to add talent. Our industry has not historically attracted many females and we can't afford to ignore nearly half the population on considering this talent source. Plus, we know they make excellent employees. As we continue to grow, add new branches and split existing ones in all our brands, as well as make acquisitions, our efforts with talent acquisition and management development enables us to continue to prepare for that growth. We know talented people have choices and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for that talent. As is reflected in our third quarter results, we are continuing to experience good organic growth across our business service lines including growth in our termite and ancillary services. More of the areas of emphasis in 2018 has been the growth of our mosquito service. While on a relatively low case, we have grown the service line over 30% on Q3 and year-to-date. This service line expansion has been largely driven by increased concern and raised public awareness around disease-borne issues, related to mosquitoes including Zika [indiscernible]. And other diseases are major contributor to this growth as customers come to us seeking answers to this threat. We believe the growth rate of our mosquito business can and will continue strongly for many years to come. We have the largest residential based customers in the industry and this is a straightforward cross-sell offered for many of our customers from someone they already trust. In fact, this is the service our customers get their highest customer satisfaction rate. From an efficiency standpoint, it is also helpful when we can have the same technician that performs the pest control service also do the mosquito service at the same time.  We recognize that customers must have a way to know all of the pest and wildlife services that we offer and our marketing group does a great job of getting that message to those customers. As you are aware, there are a wide variety of ways consumers use to make their decision. Our digital marketing team and their efforts continue to differentiate us from our competition. Probably and maybe most importantly from a connectivity standpoint, it is providing to our customers platform that works best for them. Only a few short years ago, mobile made up less than 25% of our consumer connection and now that number is over 70%. Our priority is to design mobile first in anything that we do. More recently, we have done a better job of proactively supporting our customers' needs and concerns through our online reputation management effort. Customers today want to communicate issues and share compliments more readily so we have responded in a variety of ways, mostly through the various online forums, resolving those customer issues and in many cases, turning a potentially damaging situation into a positive because of how quickly and efficiently things are handled. Well before social media, we refer to those events as a golden opportunity to satisfy and strengthen the customer relationship. As you all know in business, things change rapidly and that change moves us forward, advancing our technology effort helps with that as getting our service rep to the right place at the right time is critical to improving the satisfaction of our customers. Technology is the platform for our customers to find us, but it is also key to the success of our employees' support and the resulting customer experience. I will now turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. We are fortunate to be in an industry that is minimally impacted by trade talks or tariff, but also now strongly tied the interest rates or fluctuating oil prices. While we do have our own challenges such as continued talent acquisition development as John mentioned and evolving our offerings for a changing consumer base via technology enhancements, we do tackle these requirements on a daily basis. I mentioned this as we had multiple opportunities to celebrate, both the past and the present of Rollins during the quarter. In addition to the celebration that Gary mentioned of our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange, we also have the opportunity to celebrate one year with Northwest Exterminating which I will talk about in more detail and the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare in the country of Singapore. These celebration show the historic development of our company as the leader in the Pest Control industry and our ability to find and acquire topnotch U.S. and international companies continues. For the quarter, all of our service line showed significant growth and keys to the quarter included entry into Singapore with the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare as I have just mentioned, profit gains drove increased recurring revenue from previous quarters and cost increases from fleet expense increased which was impacted by least cost and an increase in fuel price per gallon. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues are $487.7 million was an increase of 8.3% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $450.4 million. 2017 Q3 included two months of Northwest revenue. Income before income taxes increased 8.9% to $89.9 million from $82.6 million in 2017. We are beginning to reap the benefits as anticipated from the historically high recurring revenue growth that we saw in Q2. Net income rose 29.6%, $66.6 million and earnings per share increased 29.2% to $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, there were two unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to historic prior quarters, as they will for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits which impact the third quarter EPS by a penny. As a reminder and as John just mentioned, we approved our 401(k) match and provided one-time stock ramp to many of our U.S. based employee. These enhancements continue to be received very positively by our employees. Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 17.8%. Over the past five years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by just over half a penny. And like our benefits enhancements, we believe is a tremendous investment for our future. Moving forward, we will begin reporting EBITDA wince that will be a more meaningful measurement at this time. For Q3, EBITDA was $106.7 million, up 10.2% over 2017. One of the key acquisitions that have caused the increase in amortization of intangible is Northwest Exterminating. On August 1 of this year, we celebrated our one year anniversary with Northwest and it has been a great year. Financially, Northwest continues to grow revenue at levels significantly better than our overall Rollins average. Their unique advertising which features the Pesky Mouse hat many of you were able to meet at our recent Analyst Day combined with their incredible service execution enables them to continue to gain market share. One of the great byproducts of acquiring good quality companies is the fact that we learn from them, and we are also able to share things that we learn from other Rollins' companies in the past. An example of this is Northwest has grown their business with their Green Elite program. This industry leading service offering combines green solutions for pest, mosquito and termite for those customers that prefer these types of treatment. These unique offerings have been shared with our other specialty brands to consider based on their geography and needs. One of the benefits that Northwest has obtained up during the past year has been access to our talented IT group. Recent negotiations have enabled our Rollins' IT group to upgrade Northwest CRM and receive a healthy cost savings. This is one area of margin improvement that helps Northwest and all of us. When addressing our Company's geographic footprint, we have found opportunities to combine our Northwest business with other of our Company's brand to streamline the customer offerings and become more efficient. We will continue to see these types of opportunities, as our company's continue to grow. Let's take a look through o the revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 8.3% and included 3.2% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 5.7% and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 11%. Both residential and the termite segment benefited from Northwest and OPC acquisitions. Again total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1% from that residential was up 6.7%, commercial increased 2.5% and termite improved by 6.5%. The residential growth rate is the fastest since Q1, 2017 and was positively impacted by the mosquito growth that John mentioned. In total gross margin for the quarter was 51.6%, up from 51.4% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling technology, as stocks per mile improved by over 5% in September even as we have lapped over routing and scheduling efforts from a year ago. This helped alleviate the increased fleet expenses that we saw for the quarter. Fleet expenses increased $1.8 million or 10.7% for the quarter driven by higher price per gallon cost and increased leased fleet vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan match and the stock grants that we announced earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $2.6 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 17.8%. Depreciation increased $900,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $10.1 million or 7.5% to $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues down three-tenth of a percentage point from $134.9 million or 30% of revenues for the third quarter of 2017. A decrease in the percent of revenues is due to lower administrative salaries and sales salaries, which increased slower than revenue, as well as lower advertising, as a percent of revenue and reduced professional expenses, as we wrap up various projects. As for our cash position for the period ending September 30th, 2018, we spent $77.7 million on acquisitions compared to $127.9 million the same period last year, as we continue to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We also had $91.7 million on dividends, an increase of 22%. We have a $19.6 million of CapEx, which was up 14.1% from 2017 primarily from planned IT investments such as our BOSS Canada roll-out and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $118.7 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiary. Last night the Board of Directors approved three-for-two stock split of the Company's common shares. The split will be affected by issuing one additional share of common stock for every two shares of common stock held. The additional shares will be distributed on December 10th, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 9th, 2018. Fractional share amounts resulting from the split will be paid to shareholders in cash. In addition, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, plus a special year-end dividend of $0.14 per share both payable December 10th, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business November 9th, 2018. Dividends will be paid on pre-split shares. Before I turn the call back over to Gary, I would like to thank those of you that made the time to join us for our 50th New York Stock Exchange event. We truly enjoyed spending time with you and hope that you found value and the time spent with our team. Gary, I'll turn the call back to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well, we're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hi, thank you all for taking the questions. When we think about the organic growth and you shared a little bit of this with us in prior quarters, how we should think about margin pressure from -- you add new customers, they are not profitable initially, then they get incrementally increasingly more profitable. So can you frame your organic growth, how much was new customer versus outright price? And also talk about where we are in renewals or retention because those were the two sort of points since leverage into the margins going forward? Eddie Northen : Yes, Michael thanks for the question. So we don't break out the specifics of a price and the new customer by quarter. We'll kind of talk about that at a high level. I will tell you that retention, we had a really good retention quarter. John and team continue to make improvements in the area of reducing cancel customers. The service levels continue to be improved, and I think that as well as the communication we have through our technology is helping to make that overall customer experience better. So retention definitely a positive for us. We continue to add new customers and our pricing has probably stayed relatively intact with what we've seen in previous quarters somewhere between that 1% and 2% range. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And when you frame retention good, is it -- did it get better in Q3 versus a year ago or Q2, I mean so. Eddie Northen : It did get better and we've seen -- we've seen incremental improvements in our retention over the last probably eight quarters now, but Q3 was even little bit of a better positive step there for us. Michael Hoffman : Both year-over-year and Q-on-Q, so it's sequential improvement as well as year-over-year? Eddie Northen : Correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then ASC 842 given that you lease lots of equipment. How do you think about what that means to the business model from us modeling in 2019? What are the things that you should be telling us to think about today? Eddie Northen : We don't have any numbers at this point in time to share with everyone. We have leases, vehicles, we have leases, facilities, and we also have some other outline leases such as things like uniforms and different things like that. So we're still working through that process. We'll be prepared, as we're moving forward in future calls. At this time, we don't anticipate there being anything materially different, but as we have more information we'll share that with you. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then one last question on some of the organic growth... Eddie Northen : Sorry. Mike let's someone else take out -- take your question if you could. We will get you back into the queue. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Clement with Buckingham Research. Jamie Clement : Good morning, gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. John Wilson : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Jamie Clement : Thank you. We're having some technical difficulties on a prior call earlier. Gary, it seems to me, I mean just reading some industry stuff, it seems like the pace of merger activity among even smaller players in the industry, just local players seems to me to have accelerated. Does that have any ramifications on your acquisition strategy going forward? And what do you think might be explaining some of that? I mean, if some of it just demographically people just getting ready to retire, I think they doesn't have those second tier or third generation to take over the business. What's going on there? Gary Rollins : Well, I think the last case is certainly there that you have aging owners and -- and some cases with no areas [ph] that's really particularly interested in the business, I think that's one of the motivation. There's a lot of interest in activity in the acquisition area. There is -- some of the international companies are realizing what a good market that North American is and that's probably accelerated some of our efforts in energy. But the great thing is the last couple of deals that we made we were the only suitable cost with the reputation that we have in absorbing these new companies versus the other guys. And in fact one of the things that we do is give them the phone numbers and saying call these other acquired companies and see if they're happy or not. So we're just stepped on the gas a little bit and we're particular though, I mean we don't want just anything we -- it's foolish to buy a very low price company when one of the things that drives our success is the fact that we charge good rates for the business that we do. So we have to find the right individual, the right company and we're working hard at it. Jamie Clement : Okay. Thanks very much for the color. John, I think you were the one making the comments around unemployment rate being low and recruiting and all that kind of stuff. I think you mentioned your retention rate among technicians is still very high. How has your message in recruiting changed over the years? How do you convince a millennial that the pest control industry is the right one for them? John Wilson : James, that's a great question. We're always working on that. I don't know how you would answer that as far as millennials go. That is the largest group that we hire today. Jamie Clement : Right. John Wilson : So we're still continuing to or we are continuing to attract a good many of them. So our retention is slightly up, it's a low pressure. We just have to turn over a lot of law rocks and keep looking harder and harder. Jamie Clement : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, all, for your time as always. John Wilson : Thank you, Jamie. Gary Rollins : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti & Company. Chris McGinnis : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the growth in mosquito, maybe how penetrated that is throughout the network itself and it sound like you feel pretty confident going forward with the strength of growth maybe just a little bit more around that why -- why is that rate or at a pretty high rate? Eddie Northen : Yes, Chris, thanks. This is Eddie. So we've offered the mosquito products for several years, but it is not been one that we really had put a lot of time and effort into from a coordinated basis on the marketing and the operation side. And so those that were kind of -- kind of on the forefront, we're out there trying to -- trying to work and win the mosquito business.But now that we have marketing that has really put a good push on the operators are on the same page, 2018 we saw a really good first step forward. We saw it in several of our brands, Orkin, Northwest HomeTeam, as well as other brands that were out there that had good growth. And I think that we'll continue to see that, as we've seen this momentum start in 2018. I think we'll continue to see this, as we move forward in time. John I don't know, if there is anything else you want to add as far as that concern. John Wilson : I do. Our technicians have always -- we've always relied on them offering that service for our customers, as opposed to advertising Eddie touched on that. And so penetration has been not that great in many markets, but probably Northeast is where we started with our first and so that's probably the greatest as well as the Southeast. So those were the -- those were the two areas to answer your question about what's our market penetration. We just have a ton of opportunity both still in those two markets, as well as elsewhere. Gary Rollins : I think the health risk has also created greater demand. I think you read about these articles almost every other week that there's been more mosquito-related health problems. We don't really see that even the CDC has not given us any attention or assurance that's going to change. I think it will -- we think it will just continue to pick up, plus the customers are highly satisfied with this service. I mean, we're really giving them their backyard back if they can barbecue and enjoy a better lifestyle when the mosquitoes are not keeping them in the house. Chris McGinnis : Great. Appreciate that color. And then one other question, just on the organic growth rate and the new customer wins. Do you have any color in terms of were they -- were the customer beforehand or they did not have a solution prior to you coming in. Can you say -- give a little color on that -- offhand? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes, Chris, so this is Eddie. So we'll have some about. We'll have share of wallet and piece of that can be exactly what we're -- were' just talking about what the mosquito. So they are an existing pest control customer of ours. We cross sell them the mosquito and so we pick up new revenue at that point in time. But we also are incrementally taken some market share. I talked about this specifically in Northwest and the games that they're seeing in the markets that they're in. But we are seeing that with some of our other companies as well. So both -- I think it's really both that are -- that are going out for us. Chris McGinnis : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good luck in Q4. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Kennedy with Nomura. Sean Kennedy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Sean Kennedy : I have two quick questions. The first, could you comment on the deceleration in commercial. Does that have anything to do with the hurricanes or just in general? Eddie Northen : I don't think we know if it's impacted by the hurricanes, but the second hurricane would have probably the more impacted in the current quarter. The Q3 that we had this year we're comping the biggest growth that we had in 2017 beginning of the quarters. [Indiscernible] had a little bit of it. And then we're also going to always have a little bit of lumpiness kind of in between the quarters as well. When you look at the full year, it's absolutely in line with what we've seen over the previous probably three years now. Sean Kennedy : Okay. Great. And then, I was also wondering if you could comment on the recent revenue trends for HomeTeam especially if you've seen any near term deceleration due to a recent slowing in housing economic data? Thank you. Eddie Northen : We have not seen any slowing at all with HomeTeam. They have over a million customers that we put the -- or they put the Taexx system in. So even if housing does slow, which of course we know it will at some point in time, they have a database to be able to go and win new customers even without new homes being built. So they're constantly working on that. They also have a very robust mosquito business. And then also in the termite business that we talked about before the pre-treating for the termites as well as the recurring of termite service. So the Taexx is what they're known for and there are big things that they do, but they also have other revenues that they've been successful with. Sean Kennedy : Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Eddie Northen : Yes. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, everybody. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : Can you give us a quick update on your tech initiatives, where you are at in terms of deployment of VRM Orkin 2.0 and maybe the BOSS system in Orkin Canada? Gary Rollins : So I just think, I'll start with the last one first the BOSS system in Orkin Canada. They're on track for us to be able to see something early 2019. So we've gone through -- we're going through the development, going through the adjustments that need to be made for currency, for frequency of services, for some different service lines. But we feel like we'll be able to see something rolled out pretty well early 2019, which means we should be able to see some type of benefits toward the end of 2019 for Canada. As far as the other initiatives are concerned, we continue to test and roll out the new visibility that we're going to have for our customers that we talked about when you were at the Stock Exchange Analyst Day. We're -- we're continuing to get good feedback from customers with that that are feeling better about the communication that we're giving them and kind of giving them a better overall customer experience. The virtual route management, I talked a little bit about the improvements that we saw in September having to do with -- with our miles and that's even after lapping this over another year. So over 5% gain in September alone on top of what we've seen in previous -- in the previous year. So all the initiatives continue to move forward well. The IT team is staying on top of the request from the operations side to make sure that we are using BOSS most efficiently and most effectively. And I think on average, the IT group gets and implements 100 small upgrades on a monthly basis. So they're constantly just fine tuning and tweaking it, just to make it a little bit better and a little bit easier to use and little bit more customer-friendly for us. So continued positive momentum in those areas. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you. Moving on -- maybe one more. Eddie a lot of services-related industries are highlighting higher labor costs and lower labor availability as key issues to consider particularly when forecasting margins. So maybe can you just remind us, what your total labor costs are, as a percentage of sales? And maybe what has been the increase in labor cost this year or maybe how much -- can you quantify how much its pressured gross margins in the quarter, just any -- any other detail? Eddie Northen : I'll say it's not enough for us to highlight that as a headwind. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Eddie Northen : It has kind of stayed intact based on our revenue growth overall. And as you know a lot of our operations are working kind of on a productivity basis. So it makes more sense for them to use this technology that we had in place for them to be more efficient to drive less and to be able to work more and they're getting a little bit of a benefit, where they're getting the benefit of that from -- from the pay perspective, when they get an opportunity to do more jobs. So we're really not seeing that as an headwind at this point, but we'll continue to manage that. The thing that we got to make sure that we're staying ahead of is, is retaining the employees best we can because of course, there are -- there are costs that are related to hiring, to finding and hiring new employees. But again it's not something that we wouldn't be even listed out as the top three or four item on any of our cost-related areas. Gary Rollins : One of the reasons that we increased our benefits, people hold benefits certainly equal, if not higher than compensation or their -- their pay -- take home pay. So we made a pretty big move as far as improving the 401(k) and scholarships and stock to the -- our North American employees, which we think will make a big difference both in recruiting and retaining our employees. The other thing that we are proud of is how well the stocks done. We have about 85% and 90% of our employees were in the 401(k) plan. So when the stock goes up, you know, their assets go up and their retirement benefits go up. So we think we've got a lot of things working for us that -- that some of the others really don't. It was amazing how a few people really took the tax money and spend it, invested with their employees. Tim Mulrooney : Right. Good point, Gary. Thank you for that color and thank you, Eddie. I'll hop back in the queue. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fanelli with Gabelli Research. Paul Fanelli : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Paul Fanelli : Thanks for taking our questions. On the second quarter call, you've called out some higher startup cost associated with the growth in recurring revenue. Has that trend continued in Q3 or those sort of recurring revenues started to mature at all? Eddie Northen : We did see, if you take a look at the income before taxes and the income after, you'll see we had a little bit of an acceleration compared to Q2 and the year-to-date number. So we are seeing some of the benefits from the historically high Q2 recurring revenue growth that we saw, but we did see our recurring revenue growth in Q3 grow at a higher-than-average rate. So we're continuing to see positive in that area not -- again not to the same degree we saw in Q2. So we saw little bit of benefits that are -- that are of the majority of that that have started and our -- our anticipation would be, we'll continue to see that as we move into Q4, and as we move into next year. Paul Fanelli : Okay, great. And then just a follow-up. You discussed sort of the continued trends with the BOSS system and VRM being able to offset some fuel cost at least 5% improvement in the mileage. Can you give any color around, how much increase in leasing cost and fuel cost that you've been able to offset? Eddie Northen : So we haven't broken that out. It did not offset a 100% of it. Our price per gallon was up $0.56 year-over-year, which is a significant increase. So we did not offset said that. But it offset more than half of it, I will say that. Paul Fanelli : Okay, that's hepful. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : I would like to follow-up on one of the questions that was asked earlier on this margin, your investing margin and growth, but remember we saw that compression in the first half, we're starting to see some margin expansion in the second half. How do you frame how we should see the end of the year? Do we end up flat with a slightly positive bias in EBITDA or does this accelerate, I'm trying just to understand where we gain some of this operating leverage, as you benefit from some of the growth? Eddie Northen : Michael, I think flat to slightly positive is what we'll see, as we finish out the year. And then I think as we go into 2019, we'll see a little bit more acceleration from that. The time that we see the benefits from this recurring revenue is after the third and fourth service. So based on the service frequency that the customer has will depend on when we will see the benefits from that. So again historically high growth rates in Q2, if you look at in every other months, where customer, you can do the math as far as when we would really see the benefits. And then again in Q3 like I just mentioned, we saw above average recurring revenue growth, which we'll see positive improvements from as we move forward as well, so. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then tying that margin story to your 401(k) investment the intention was to do it in 2018 at that level and then it stays at that level in 2019. So I should see, I get a benefit of that into 2019 all else being equal? John Wilson : Yes, that' correct. The stock option as well. The stock options were a one-time event, but incrementally, you're right. We will have already lapped that on the 401(k). Michael Hoffman : Right. Did we calculate it correct, ti's about 60 basis points of pressure on margins? What was the benefit of that? Eddie Northen : I think it was a little bit more than that. I don't have that number on top of my head. We can take a look and see what that is. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And one last one, thank you for your patience. Where are you able to use technology in the things like bait traps, things like that where you helped us labor [ph] leverage thing particularly in commercial or sort of having to look at all 25 bait traps, you only have to look at something went in and chewed on the bait. And that where are we in progress in bringing technology to help drive labor utilization [indiscernible] much hiring issues as well as those people. Eddie Northen : Yes, Michael, we'll take this as the last call for you or the -- I'm sorry, the last question for you. We continue to look at the opportunities from a technology perspective. We continue to look at all the different opportunities that are out there. We've tested, I believe probably every single opportunity that's out there, we want to make sure that we are understanding what the best opportunities that are. This is still a human business at the same time. Making sure that we have the right connection with our customers is an extremely important part. So we're going to continue to make sure that we understand what technology benefits exist and where that would make sense, we'll go through and we'll put those in place. We really only had the most opportunity, where we have the BOSS operating system and we don't have that in all places as well. But we'll be positioned when and if there is indeed from a market perspective to be able to put that in place. Michael Hoffman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Clement with Buckingham Research. Jamie Clement : Yes. Thanks for the follow-up. I mean, Eddie my recollection is I excluding the noise from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of last year, your fourth quarter of last year my recollection was very, very strong. Is there anything we need to think about as we model the fourth quarter from a year-over-year perspective that hasn't come out on the call yet? Eddie Northen : I don't believe there's anything it hasn't come out on the call. I think the last question, where we talked about the recurring revenue and where we'll see the improvements on the profitability side. I think we'll continue to see that help us in Q4 and moving into next year. I think based on everything we know right now, those are probably the most impactful items. We still don't have a full view of everything from the hurricanes. We don't anticipate it being anything material based on what we know right now. Jamie Clement : All right, terrific. Thanks very much for the extra time. I appreciate it. Eddie Northen : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Thanks for the follow-up. Eddie, I think maybe you said this in the prepared remarks, but how many companies have you acquired year-to-date and what was the total cash paid? Eddie Northen : The number is 34. I'm looking to see if we have the numbers here. I don't think we've said the number of companies. But we're going -- we can take -- we can take a look real quick in dollars we do have, I believe it's $77 million [indiscernible] that's right. Yes, so $77 million this year, it was $127 million last year because we had Northwest that we purchased last year. So $77 million so far this year. And we'll take a look to see if we have the companies. But of course, that will be made available once we have our 10-Q available, the number of companies would be available. Tim Mulrooney : You know what, I'll just wait for the 10-Q. Thanks, guys Congrats on the quarter. Bye. Eddie Northen : Yes. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Tim Mulrooney : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter and year-end results in January. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We're pleased to report our 51st consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. Revenues for the quarter grew 7.2% to $444.6 million compared to $414.7 million for the fourth quarter last year. Net income increased 51.1% to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $33.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the same quarter of 2017. Revenues for the full year rose 8.8% to $1.822 billion compared to $1.674 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 29.3% to approximately $231.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared to net income of $179.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share for the full year 2017. We experienced good growth in all of our service lines for the quarter with residential up 7.8%, commercial pest control rose 5.9% and termite and ancillary rose 8.2%. 2018 was a good year for Rollins as we continue to build our global presence through acquisitions, both domestically and overseas. In the U.K. we expanded our footprint with the acquisition three fine companies, Guardian Pest Control, Ames Group and Kestrel Pest Control. We also achieved an important milestone for the company, when we acquired Aardwolf Pestkare. This is Rollins' first company-owned operation in Singapore. In the U.S. we acquired OPC Pest Control, the premier pest control company in Kentucky and we also made small tuck-in acquisitions and year-end we had added a total of 38 companies to our roster. We also continue to expand the Orkin brand internationally with the addition of franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and other locations. The Orkin brand is now represented at 57 countries throughout 86 international franchises. As we enter 2019, strategic acquisition remain a focus of our growth strategy. We're extremely pleased to have announced earlier this month, our agreement to acquire Clark Pest Control, headquartered in Lodi, California, Clark has operations in over 20 locations in California and Nevada. Founded by Charlie Clark in 1950, the company has grown to be eighth largest pest control provider in the U.S. Clark recorded revenues of $130 million in 2017. The company is also growing at a faster rate than we are as well as a faster rate than the overall pest control industry. I first visited with the company over 20 years ago when I was fortunate enough to meet Charlie Clark, an icon in our industry. We admired the company throughout all this time. The Clark acquisition will be the largest in our company's history. John will provide more details on this acquisition, but I wanted to express our enthusiasm in acquiring this fine company and personally welcome their team to the Rollins family. I'd now like to turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. As Gary noted, we're very pleased to have Clark Pest Control join our family. The Clark team is a natural fit for Rollins, sharing the same values that we do. More on that later. They service customers through more than 20 branch locations in Northern and Southern California and Nevada. Clark Pest Control is stronger in the upper central valley in Northern California areas than Orkin and our other brands. It was very interesting to learn during our due diligence process how closely linked Clark and our biggest brand, Orkin are in their history. As you may know, Orkin was founded by Otto Orkin in 1901, but didn't expand to the West Coast prior to the Rollins purchase in 1964. Meanwhile Charlie Clark founded Clark Pest Control in California in 1950 and patterned Clark on some of the foundational principles of quality customer service, delivered by well-trained people just as Otto Orkin did. Both companies have certainly retained those principles of quality service, delivered by well-trained team members today. Clark has long been recognized as a premier pest control company in residential, commercial and termite services in the markets it serves. Their strong culture of customer service has been aided by very high employee retention rates and has resulted in a loyal and expanding customer base. We are aware that owners have a choice when they look to sell their business and there are four very important factors that come into play. What is best for their family, their employees and their customers, as well as receiving value for their company. We take each of those into account and customize our acquisition plan to fit those factors. What was apparent in our discussions with Clark from the beginning is how deeply they care about what would happen to their employees and customers following the sale. They, like us, recognize how important their people are to their success and also like us are dedicated to continually improving both the employee and the customer experience. Over time, we have distinguished ourselves with our acquisitions where team management and employees remain all in active work and it is one reason why Rollins has gained the reputation of being the industry's acquirer of choice. Sellers know they can trust us to live up to our word once we have closed on a purchase. We even invite potential parties to reach out to the brands we have acquired as well as the ones we have lost out on to see if they're happy or not. In addition to Clark Pest Control expanding our presence in California and Nevada, we believe the company provides significant opportunities for Rollins and Clark to learn from each other, which we have repeatedly expressed as one of our primary objectives with our acquisition. Potential opportunities we have encountered previously include materials and suppliers purchasing that are vehicle leasing arrangements, training, employee benefit and lower technology and communication expenses to name a few. Rollins will fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt. Eddie will go into further financial details related to this acquisition in a few minutes. Clark Pest Control under the leadership of long-term Clark team member, Robert Baker, who will join our Specialty Brands group, led by Jerry Gahlhoff. Brands in this group include HomeTeam, Western, Waltham, Northwest Exterminating and OPC Services. Jerry and I have had the privilege of visiting every Clark operations to meet with their employees and personally welcome them to Rollin. We wanted them to know that they are valued and how much we look forward to working with them to further advance their great brand. I'll now turn the call back over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. Before I get into our quarterly and yearend numbers, I want to reiterate the positive impact of our enhanced employee benefit. Our people are so pleased with the investment that we made in 2018 and looking back this was absolutely the right decision and has been reinforced by the positive result that they have produced for the year. As you may recall in April, we increased our 401(k) match and provided stock grants to our employees, which added about $10 million to our expense for the year, but this recognition of their impact on our business is rippling through our results. A recent leadership meeting in Atlanta was the first that we have had -- first that we held since rolling this announcement out last April. The comments of many of the over 100 participants were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative. I want to share a few of the positive changes that we have seen. All employees want to work for an employer of choice. Our employee retention rate has the best year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter in 2018 since 2016. As you know, during that same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 4.7% down to 3.9% in December of 2018. Investing in our people is one of the components that has helped us in this area. We've also often talked about how important our technicians are in their relationship with our customers. Our improved employee retention has translated directly to higher customer retention in Q4 and for all of 2018. Our organic growth rates, again, ticked to historic highs as a result of better technician and customer retention. Enhancing our employee benefits will continue to drive improvements in employee and customer retention for years to come. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included record organic growth rates, piloting testing of the BOSS rollout in Canada, and as I just mentioned, improvements in our employee retention rate tied to our enhanced employee benefits. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $444.6 million was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million. Income before income taxes increased 4.3% to $71.5 million from $68.5 million in 2017. Expense and depreciation increased during the quarter as we continued to roll out and began testing BOSS in Canada. Net income rose 51.1% to $51 million, and EPS increased 60% to $0.16 per diluted share compared to $0.10 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $87.8 million, up 5.1% over Q4 of 2017. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we continue to make sizable acquisitions that will impact our depreciation and amortization. For the 12 months that ended December 31, we produced record revenues of $1.822 billion, which was an increase of 8.8% over the same time period last year. Income before income taxes increased 5.5% to $310.7 million, and net income rose 29.3% to $231.7 million compared to 2017. EPS increased 29.1% to $0.71 per share compared to $0.55 per share in 2017. EBITDA was $377.3 million in 2018 compared to $350.8 million in 2017, up 7.5%. Our financial health enables us to be -- I'm sorry, enables us to continue to be nimble and improve our business. Companies that did not anticipate change and take advantage of market opportunities and seek ways to make it easier for your customers to do business with you do not drive, and in some cases, do not survive. The past 50 years have shown that Rollins has successfully managed for the long-term, and the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control is a great example of that. John gave some good color on the Clark's impending purchase based on his time working on this acquisition and spending a lot of time visiting their employees. But let's shift our attention to what we know about the financial impact of the impending acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We anticipate closing sometime in Q1 of 2019, subject to obtaining regulatory clearance. For all of you that have asked would we be willing to leverage our balance sheet, this is your deal. While we plan to use cash for a portion of the purchase, we will be taking on debt in the form of a term loan tied to LIBOR to supplement the rest. This deal makes taking on debt worthwhile for us, and again, is investing in our future for decades to come. The company is very profitable, but with the goodwill amortization, Clark will not add to EPS in year 1 but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once we close on the deal, we will share more related to the anticipated impact of this acquisition on our total Rollins results moving forward. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increased 7.2% and included 1.6% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 7.8%. Commercial pest control, which made up 39% of our revenue, was up 5.9%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 8.2%. Both residential and termite benefit from our OPC acquisition. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.6%, and from that, residential was up 6.8%, commercial increased 3.2%, and termite improved by 7.5%. Back to my earlier point on employee and customer retention, for the full year, total organic revenue grew 5.3% and is the fastest organic growth rate in over 5 years. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total, we grew 7.1%, residential grew 8%, commercial pest control was up 5%, and termite improved 8.5%. In total, gross margin for the quarter was 50.2%, up slightly from 50% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling, even as we have last efforts that began 18 months ago. Average miles driven per vehicle in our Orkin fleet were down an additional 2.6% year-over-year. Fleet expenses increased $3 million or 13.6% for the quarter, driven by moderated but still higher price per gallon costs and increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and onetime employee stock grants. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.7 million to $16.6 million, an increase of 11.3%. Depreciation increased $790,000 due to acquisitions, equipment purchases and continued BOSS rollout. While amortization of intangible assets increased $900,000 due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter increased $12.1 million or 9.8% to $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues, up 0.7% from $123.7 million or 29.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily driven to higher sales salaries of $3.1 million due to higher sales commissions, which is tied to our record organic growth rate; $3 million additional expense in administrative salaries, attributable to amortization of restricted stock grants and expense associated with acquisitions; personnel-related increase of $1.9 million from the enhanced 401(k) benefits. In Q4, we saw an increase in the 401(k) match as more employees benefited from these enhancements. The full year SG&A number increased 9.4% and came in at 30.2% of revenue compared to 30.1% of revenue in 2017. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2018, we spent $76.7 million on acquisitions compared to $130.2 million the same period last year, which included Northwest Exterminating, and as we continued to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We paid $152.7 million on dividends, which included a special dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which was an increase of 25.2%. We have $27.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 9.7% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $115.5 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on March 11, 2019, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 11, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : We'll take our first question from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Dan. Dan Dolev : Good morning. So I have two questions. One question and then a follow up. So it looks like organic growth was actually really, really strong and impressive and definitely ahead of what we were modeling. Can you maybe give us a little stand about how the weather impacted it? I know it was a little colder in the first -- at least, in the first two months, it was colder in key areas like Florida. Is the execution getting better? Is this share gains? What is driving this strength in organic growth? Then I have a follow up. Thank you. Gary Rollins : So Dan, I would point back to my opening comments. We see our employee retention improve. We know there's a direct correlation with the retention of our customers. We saw our customer retention improve and while there was to your point, there were weather issues in pockets of the country I think we saw better retention of our existing customers as well as additional better sales in some different areas, which caused part of our increase in our sales commission. I think those key items really helped us continue to move that in the right direction. Dan Dolev : Got it. That make sense. And then my follow up is\u2026 Operator : We'll now take our next question from Jamie Clement from Buckingham Asset Management. Please go ahead. Jamie Clement : Good morning, gentlemen. John, I think it was John, or maybe it was Eddie, but I think you mentioned the Clark historically, has outgrown the industry, and I think he might have even said outgrown you all. Is that a function of the geography, is that they're in California, Nevada, or there's something extra special about their special [sauce] [ph]? Gary Rollins : They've been there since 1950. I think it's probably fair to say they have been the premiere provider in that greater area for a lot of years, and I think they figured it out from a customer experience and [the boy] [ph] perspective and one of the reasons why they are a great cultural fit for us. But I know John spent a lot of time out there and \u2013John probably has stuff to add to that. John Wilson : Yeah, Jamie, I would say that comparable to our operations out there, our growth has been fairly similar. That area over the last ten years or so for us, has been then led really well and so our out there has been fairly similar. It\u2019s other areas where the -- maybe the Pest control market a little more mature that our growth lag. But there's no doubt they're a special company with a special group of people that really -- they really care about the family that has led them so well for so many years and that their brand living on and we're intent on helping them do that. Jamie Clement : Thank you. And Eddie you've -- you want to defer talking intangible amortization and interest expense until the next quarter. Eddie Northen : I am sorry, Jamie. I didn\u2019t quite understand what you said. Jamie Clement : Oh I am sorry, Eddie. I was saying you wanted to defer discussing intangible amortization and borrowing cost until the next quarter related to Clark. Eddie Northen : Yes. We haven't closed on the deal. So this is still a pending deal. So we want to work through those issues and then we'll be ready to talk more about some of the specifics from there. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning. So I wanted to talk about operating margins, they contracted I think 60 basis points for the full year. How much of this was the temporary impacts from onboarding more recurring customers something you guys have been talking about, which I know negatively impacts margins near-term and do you expect this dynamic to have the reverse impact on operating margins in 2019? Eddie Northen : Yes, this is very intuitive question and we talked about that a lot and I believe in our Q2 call and we\u2019ve continued to see sales that have been impressive. Recurring revenue sales that have been impressive in Q3 and in Q4. So I think to your point, there is definitely some cost that is associated and in there and typically what we see is when that's lowered or at some point Tom, when those recurring sales kind of trail off a little bit is when we really see the overall positive impact on the margin side and it\u2019s a good thing for the long term to not see that because the recurring sales continue to be strong and if you remember back to the discussion we had in Q2, we talked about those being almost double-digit numbers. And for some of our products, we still continue to see extremely strong recurrent sales. So that's definitely impacted in that number. Gary Rollins : If I may add something, I think one of the other drivers behind our progress in this area is our enhanced use of the Internet. I have to give our marketing folks credit that they just continue to work on how to buy better and how to use our presence in the Internet and fortunately those leads question was brought up earlier about Mother Nature. Mother Nature certainly can put a damper on things, but that was more than offset I believe by the efficiency that we gain from the Internet. Eddie Northen : Tim does that help with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah, it does help, Eddie, and thank you Gary. I'm curious, were there any other major factors that you highlighted as what drove that 60 basis point contraction? I guess the employee benefit program, is that the other big one? Eddie Northen : So the employee benefits program is -- and of course, that's not going to be recurring. We'll lap that. This is the last quarter we'll talk about that. So that's the 401(k) piece as well as the stock piece. We know that on the vehicle side that, well, fuel prices have moderated somewhat compared to previous quarters, they're still up year over year, has been an impact. And then we had other factors outside of that. Gary Rollins : I think one other thing that is noteworthy is, we've been very aggressive as far as our IT expenditures. The enhancement to BOSS, the pace of the rollout of BOSS and so forth. And of course, that's going to moderate itself. But we've never spent that kind of money that we spent last year. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And I'll hop back in the queue. Eddie Northen : Yes. Thank you. Just one last thing, Tim, on that point having to do with the benefit is, we did see an acceleration in the fourth quarter as far as people taking advantage of this new enhanced benefit that we've rolled out with more 401(k) dollars. So I think the word continues to spread and people continue to understand this is a great opportunity and that number ticked a little bit higher than what we've seen in the previous quarters. Operator : We will now take our next question from Chris McGinnis from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Chris McGinnis : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just -- Eddie, I think there was -- you may be have commented on just even more acquisitions to come on the year. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the landscape now, obviously, a very strong year in '18? And just what you see ahead for the opportunities in '19, obviously, outside of Clark? Eddie Northen : Yes, so Chris, I think if you look back over the last 3 years, you'll see the dollars and/or the numbers continuing to increase. I think a little bit of that is going to be attributable to our team here, just continue to develop the relationships and being ready to go when companies are ready to go. Good quality companies are coming to the table, which, of course, we want to be a part of. We continue to expand our look into different geographies to find the right fit. As you know, Singapore this year, in 2016, the U.K. we entered, and we added some more into the U.K. this year. But I think a lot of it also has to do with the actual industry itself. It's an industry that started after World War II. Some of the original owners are having to make life decisions on what they want to do with their company. And John talked a little bit about that on how different companies make those different decisions. So I would say, we're still probably 2 to 3 -- in the next few years, I would say, we'd still be in that type of a cycle, having to deal with different companies making different decisions on what they want to do. Whether it is to hand it off and keep it within their family or whether it is to do something different and be able to pass it along. But I think there's going to continue to be opportunity. With this pending acquisition for us, it'll be our largest in our history. So it's hard to sit here and say today how active we will be. But when the right opportunity presents itself, we're still absolutely going to be at the table. But we're going to have a lot of good work to do, having to do with this, depending on what we have. Chris McGinnis : Great. Thanks. Gary Rollins : And Chris, if I may add, reputation is big with this. And how you deal with and how you treat these companies as you bring them in. And we worked really hard on that aspect. I like to tell our team, you get two things in this deal, employees and customers, and neither has to stay. And so we work really hard on making sure we keep both. Eddie Northen : And Chris, we're making sure -- yes, so just one more thing. I mean, that really is a great point and just one more thing to add in Gary's comments at the beginning. He sat down with Charlie Clark 20 years ago, and there's not a lot of other people that are out there that are sitting down with these owners and have the history that Gary has and that our Chairman have with these folks. And so when it comes time for them to make a decision, guess who got a phone call? When you have a long-term relationship, that's part of what's going to be the decision point there. So I think as long as we continue to see that and we have folks that have decisions to make, that'll be to our benefit. Chris McGinnis : Yes, I guess, just one follow-up on that. I guess, out of all the acquisitions last year, were they all privately negotiated? Or was there may be a percentage that were maybe auction based. Gary Rollins : I don't know any of on the top of my head that were... John Wilson : On auction based, there were certainly some offered up as -- by brokers, if that's what you're referring to. I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, but certainly -- and a lot of the bigger ones are typically brought to us by brokers. But there's quite a few too that we're bringing to the table through our relationships in the industry. Chris McGinnis : Thanks again for the additional color. John Wilson : Thanks, Chris. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. I'd like to talk about costs, both the OpEx as well as SG&A and how to think about what your trend should look like in '19 in comparison to '18? Would we expect to be proportional to sales -- percent of sales similar numbers or is there a little uptick? Because you've mentioned 401(k) sort of accelerated absorption by the employee base, I'm assuming that hasn't peaked. How to think that through the model, ex any influences from deals Thanks. Eddie Northen : Yes. Thanks for that question. A majority of the employee benefits related expense is going to be behind us as far as the year-over-year look is concerned. We did have -- to your point, we did have a little bit of an uptick in Q4. More folks are continuing to be able to take advantage of that. But if you take a look at the total, total numbers, there won't be anywhere near the significance of the impact from a year-over-year perspective. The sales, our commission piece, we just don't know what's going on with that. As long as we continue to find ways to be able to grow, and we continue to hit these new highs as far as our organic growth rates are concerned and our sales folks are executing, we may continue to see dollars that are in that area. On the fleet side, we're all seeing the price of fuel that continues to kind of stabilize now and when we start lapping a year-over-year, there should be less of a headwind or maybe even possibly a benefit with that. So I would say that a lot of the items that we have are onetime items on the expense side from the employee benefits. But then we also have other things that, I think, intuitively we will all see that are kind of moving in the right direction. So I would say, we would be moving in a positive direction with that as far as that particular question is concerned. Michael Hoffman : So just so I'm clear, you would expect some operating leverage? Eddie Northen : Yes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] We will now take our next question from Dan Dolev from Nomura. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, thanks for having me jump back on. I got cut off before. So my follow-up was this. Look, I look at the stock today, it's down 6%. I think this is a little bit of an unforced error. It has to do more with expectations and not -- in my view, not having guidance. Does a day like this make you want to think maybe it is time to start offering guidance? I strongly believe it could avoid such things because the organic growth was so strong, and I feel like people are missing in. Any views on that. Eddie Northen : Yes, so I guess, my view and, of course, it's the person sitting at the end of the table here ultimately gets to make that decision. But my view on that would be, I would think that you as well as the others on the call and our investors would much rather me and John and Gary and others be spending their time on running the business and making decisions on how we're going to make this better as we have for the last lots of years as opposed to answering questions on somebody's guidance or filling in a blank or reconciling something or something else like that, letting us have the autonomy to continue to execute. I think when take a look at the items that drove the \"disappointment\" that might be out there, based on what you said, having to do with the stock price. And we go through and we kind of parse through that. We look at an investment in our employees, the 401(k) benefits, we look at IT spend, rolling out enhancements in Canada where we've already seen improvements in the U.S. when we did that. Our largest acquisition and the costs that are related to that largest acquisition that's impending in our company's history and the costs that are related to that. And I think if you look at all those different pieces, and to your point, if you kind of break down into that and look and see what's onetime versus what's recurring, I think you'll see that we're running the business at a very good level. And rather than taking the time to go through and reconcile all of that, I would think that you all would want us to continue to make those decisions to make the company better. I can easily be overruled by the person at the end of the table here. Gary Rollins : That's not likely. Dan Dolev : Yes. No, I totally agree with you. I mean, it's a great quarter and the organic growth looks fantastic. And I'm surprised that -- of the stock reaction. Eddie Northen : We'll see how the rest of the day goes. How about that? Dan Dolev : I'll be watching. Thanks, guys. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Dan. Dan Dolev : Thanks. Thanks, guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : So my next one is about retention. Can you talk about the rate of change in the retention? I get you don't like to talk about the absolute number, but how does that rate of change look in 4Q and relative trend through the year? Eddie Northen : So I'll start with employee retention. Our employee retention had the best improvement we've seen since 2016, and we believe that a large contributing part of that is the enhanced employee benefits. I don't want to take anything at all away from how John and his group are managing the overall operations. Our employee opinion scores continue to go in the right direction. Gary talks a lot about the enhancements in our technology and how that makes our job almost easier for our technicians. It just makes it more straightforward. It takes a lot of the stress out of it when we have a very clear day for them to be able to go through and manage, and we start taking away issues and problems that the customer might have through better communication and things like that. So I think all of those things are making the employee retention number. But again, we feel as though the enhanced benefits are a key part of that. And then that's directly tied to improvements in the customer attention, and that's been a clear focus of John and his operations group over the last 2 years. But I can tell you unequivocally that we've seen the best improvements in Q4 and really kind of trending the right way throughout the year as far as the customer retention is concerned. Gary Rollins : You might mention podium? Eddie Northen : Yes, yes, sure, that's fine. So we've really done a better job reacting -- that's what Gary's bringing up here. We've done a better job reacting to our customers that have issues or concerns that give us that information online. Historically, we did not do a very good job communicating back with customers as far as issues and concerns, and we've done a better job with that. And we've seen the scores that have improved because of that. So we had scores that, in some areas, were not acceptable because we weren't necessarily communicating with our customers that have problems or issues. And those numbers now -- the average rating is up to about 4.7 out of 5. So in a lot of markets, we're seeing enhancements and improvements just simply in the communication, and of course, the great execution of John and his team are having from an operations' perspective. So lots of different moving parts that are all trending in the right direction, and we feel extremely good about this continuing to move as we move into 2019. Michael Hoffman : May I ask one subtle interpretation of that? Is there a difference between residential and commercial in this conversation? Eddie Northen : There is not a substantial difference between those two. There really is not. I would say that our technology enhancements, if you take a look at the customer communication piece on the residential side, has been enhanced and has been a very positive thing. But I think on the commercial side when we take a look at what we've offered as far as data and information to our commercial customers, that has been a significant technology improvement as well. And I think we've seen good improvements on both sides of the coin there. Michael Hoffman : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions over the telephone at this time. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you so much for being here or being on the call. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to reporting our first-quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2019 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we'll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. As most of you know our first quarter is a transitional quarter that leads into our higher demand pest season. Although, we rarely talk about the impact of weather on the business, this year mother nature was particularly unkind, unleashing what some referred to as the polar vortex delivering some of the coldest temperatures to parts of the country in over two decades. But as we say around here, spring always comes sometimes it's earlier, sometimes it's later. We much prefer earlier however. But it always comes and with it comes higher pest activity. This pest activity can be measured by digital and phone lead flow. March and early April confirmed that spring is arriving and service demand and sales will begin to increase significantly. The good news is that we have already added to and trained our seasonal staff to meet this increasing demand. Although, we were hampered with the coldest first quarter in the past several years we had many important operational successes. These were the result of our previous investments that will benefit our employees and customers. This quarter we achieved major improvements in both employee and customer retention. Our new technologies developed to improve our service delivery through our customer routing and scheduling and as you recall we enhanced our 401(k) and other benefits. These actions are both paying dividends, and I'll explain further in a minute. Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $429.1 million, compared to $408.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. Net income was $44.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $48.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter last year. Eddie will provide greater details on these results. Looking at our business lines in the quarter, residential pest control grew 4.9%; commercial pest control rose 4.6%; and termite and ancillary was up 4.8%. Regrettably our increased employee staffing cost, additional vehicle expense, other season-related expenses grew faster than our revenue. As promised I wanted to take a minute to elaborate on our enhanced 401(k) plan and other improved employee benefits I referred to earlier. As a service company, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset. And last year, as a result of the opportunity provided by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we elected to provide our employees with better benefits that would have a long-term positive effect for them and their families and our company. One of the most important benefits we selected to help achieve these goals was Rollins increasing their employee match to our 401(k) program. Prior to January 1, 2018, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for the contributions up to 6%. In response this benefit change has far exceeded our expectations, with many more employees now enrolled in the 401(k) program for the first time and many increasing their contribution to the plan. As a result, we now have a higher percentage of employees participating in our plan. The incremental cost is approximately $1 million a quarter however, this confirms our employees that we are investing more in their future. We believe that it also indicates that their confidence in the future of Rollins and the promise it has for them and their families. Other benefits. We also doubled the number of college scholarships, increased paid time-off and provided company stock to many selected tenured employees. Any day we are anticipating regulatory clearance for our acquisition of Clark Pest Control, a leading pest management company located in Lodi, California. Clark is the nation's eighth largest pest management company according to PCT magazine. The company operates in 26 locations. It serves residents and businesses throughout California and Northwest Nevada.  Clark has a history of excellent service and a very loyal customer base. We are thrilled to have them join our team and are confident that Clark will continue to grow and be a major contributor to Rollins. This acquisition is the largest in our company's history to date. Let me now turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. While our first quarter results were not what we expected, we have reasons to celebrate and most of that centers around our team members. Gary has already recapped the highlights of our employee benefit enhancements, so I thought to report that this year how these improvements are helping our operations. For the Orkin brand alone, we saw a 33% improvement in our most important metric employee retention. This meant that we separated from Orkin 224 fewer people. This saves time spent searching for replacement team members as well as dollars spent for training those new hires. We also saw similar employee retention improvements in nearly every other one of our brands and what we all know is a very tough labor market. During the quarter, we were also pleased to announce that Rollins and Northwest pest control has been awarded a 2019 top workplaces award by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This marked the third consecutive year for Rollins having been honored for this award, and the seventh year -- seventh consecutive year for Northwest recognition. Rollins ranks 16th in the large business category, and Northwest ranks 20th in the list of midsized companies. This honor is based solely on employees satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture including alignment, execution, leadership and connection, and more than 4,300 Metro Atlantic companies participated in this program and 80,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. Many thanks go to our leadership team, who deserve the credit for Rollins achieving this honor. We were also pleased that Rollins was recognized again this year by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations in the world. This marks the 14th time, since 2003, that either Rollins or Orkin has achieved this honor, and we still rank as the only pest management company to have received this acknowledgment. As we have said many times in the past, the training experience our employees receive is vitally important to their retention and a successful launch to their careers. It is important to us to know that they know that they have future in our company not just a job. Over the past year, Rollins introduced quite a few new or enhanced curriculum for employees, improvements in our residential and commercial service processes, leadership development, multi-unit leadership development, and customer service to name a few. Jerry Gahlhoff, President of Rollins Specialty Brands and VP of Human Resources sums it up well. Rollins believes, it's employees who are at the core of developing relationships with customers and employee training is a critical component of ensuring we are well equipped to support and serve those customers. Gary just noted how excited we are to have Clark join our Rollins family. For those of you who may not be aware, our previous acquisition -- the largest acquisition was HomeTeam, more than the decade ago. At the time of that acquisition, they were the fourth largest pest control company in the U.S. Over the years, HomeTeam has continued to thrive growing to 52 branches and over 1,700 team members, quite a growth accomplishment by any standard. From a financial perspective, HomeTeam performs extremely well. Over the past five years, HomeTeam's revenue has grown nearly 8% on average, faster than both the industry and for Rollins in total. Additionally, operating improvements -- operating profits have grown at a faster rate than Rollins overall, and their customer base is growing faster as well. HomeTeam currently provides services to 18 of the top 20 homebuilders and is the number one pest control company servicing homebuilders across the nation. They have installed the Taexx Pest Management system in more than one million homes. HomeTeam has also been recognized for the quality of its work having been the recipient of the highly coveted David Weekley Partner of Choice Quality Award for the past several years. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes in the 13 cities where it conducts business and these awards are a testimony to HomeTeam's focus on providing top-notch quality and exceptional service to its business partners. HomeTeam is just one example of the fine companies that we have added to our family of brands over the years. Thank you all for your time and I will turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. The extreme weather and late spring coupled with several one-time items contributed to uncharacteristic results for the first quarter. We were well-staffed to provide our best-in-class service between a much publicized polar vortex and the substantial rain in all of California and the Midwest, pest demand did not materialize in a normal fashion. For example there was several days in February that were impacted with snow in unlikely places like Pasadena and Las Vegas. January was a good month February a difficult -- a very difficult month and March was a more normal month. Even with late snow in many areas of the country, we see April is off to a favorable start. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and peak of the quarter included impacts of extreme weather patterns, continued improvements in both employee and customer retention, and as mentioned, several one-time items that impacted bottom-line profitability. Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $429.1 million was an increase of 5% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $408.7 million. Income before income taxes decreased 5.3% to $56.1 million from $59.2 million in 2018. Expense grew faster than revenue as we prepared for the spring season that was delayed this year. This impacted most of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 8.9% to $44.2 million and earnings per share decreased 6.7% to $0.14 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $72.5 million, down 4.9% over Q1 of 2018. As we move forward, we will speak more to EBITDA as we add Clark and more customer amortization to the Rollins family brands. Let's take a look at the one-time items that impacted the quarter. A normal quarter may see one of these items and not being a material impact. But as several of these were coupled with weather-related lower pest demand, this affected our overall gross margin. The material items were; $775,000 of professional services expenses was incurred to work through the unexpected Federal Trade Commission process for the Clark acquisition. Moving forward we expect to have an additional $250,000 in expense in Q2. Contractors involved with the fast de-lease accounting change impacted Q1 by $335,000 and will impact future quarters by a similar amount. With the growth of our international operations coupled by the strong U.S. dollar against foreign currency, the difference year-over-year was $1.3 million. Our tax rate in 2019 of 21% compared to 18% last year impacted the bottom-line by over $1 million. And the last item to note is the increase in 401(k) and stock equity vesting. While we have not planned to see any material difference year-over-year, we were very pleased to see more employees participating at a higher rate based on the popularity of the enhanced benefits that Gary mentioned. 372 additional employees began participating in our 401(k) program, bringing our participation rate up to 95.8% in 2019. Additionally, the overall contribution per person increased as well. These items impacted both CSP and SG&A for the quarter. The combinations of 401(k) increase and vesting of equity awards granted last year impacted the quarter by an additional $1.5 million. As Gary mentioned, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Clark. And last quarter, John spent some time sharing what he and Jerry learned while visiting employees of this great company. For the first time in my tenure at Rollins, the bankers are very happy with us. We will be taking out a $250 million term loan tied to LIBOR using our credit line for $100 million and using cash for the remainder of the purchases. I say purchases because we will complete two separate transactions to close the deal. We will first close on the real estate portion of the owned Clark properties, which equated to about 21 properties and then close on the pest business portion of Clark. We will begin paying these loans back as early as July of this year with an intent to have all loans paid off within the next two years. As I mentioned last quarter, Clark is very profitable. But with the depreciation, goodwill amortization and loan interest, Clark will not add to EPS in year one, but will be generating significant additional cash flow. Once the valuation is complete, we will be able to share more specifics of the financial impact. But we know that amortization of customer contracts will increase our overall amortization between 25% and 35% year-over-year in 2019. We will share more related to the anticipated impact of this deal on our total Rollins results moving forward. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the first quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 5% that included 1.1% from several acquisitions and the remaining 3.9% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 4.9%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 4.6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue was up 4.8%. Both residential pest control and termite were most impacted by the severe weather. Again, total revenue, less acquisitions was up 3.9%. And from that, residential pest control was up 4.5%, commercial increased -- commercial pest control increased 2.5% and termite and ancillary grew 4.3%. In total, gross margin was down slightly to 49.4% from 49.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced an increase in administrative salaries, as we amortize the employee-restricted share grants provided last year. Additionally, fleet expenses were up as leased vehicle expenses were higher as well as increases in contractor expense associated with the new lease accounting pronouncement that I mentioned in my opening. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $200,000 to $16.7 million, a decrease of 1.4%. Depreciation increased $400,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $600,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. These numbers will change substantially once we complete the acquisition of Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $13 million or 10.3% to $139.5 million or 10.3% of revenues, up 1.6 percentage points from $126.5 million or 13.9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenue is primarily due to the increases in administrative salaries, which were up due to amortization of restricted share grants from 2018, sales salaries as sales increased during the period and personnel-related expenses related to the employee 401(k) match that I discussed. Additionally, there were increases in professional services, related to contractors used to update the leases for the new accounting standard. As for our cash position for the period ending March 31, 2019, we spent $7 million on acquisitions compared to $43.2 million the same period last year, which did include OPC. We paid $34.3 million on dividend and had $6.5 million of capital expenditures, which was up 5.7% from 2018, primarily related to planned IT upgrade such as our BOSS Canada rollout. We ended the period with $116.6 million in cash of which $60.5 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business May 10, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.9% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we made the decision to derisk our pension and move it off of our books about 12 months ago. We are on schedule for this to finalize in the third quarter. At that time, we will have a significant one-time non-cash accounting charge related to the finalization of this process. I will share more details in Q2 as we get closer to the end of this process. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well, we're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Sean Kennedy with Nomura. Please go ahead. Sean Kennedy : Good morning everyone. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning Sean. Sean Kennedy : So I had a question about the operating margins this quarter. I know Eddie touched on it, but even adding back this $3 million of add backs that you called out on the press release, it's still getting back to around 14% operating margin. So I was wondering, if you could maybe detail some of the other pressures and then see and describe whether they are recurring or just one-time? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes. I will point you back to the softness of the quarter from a weather perspective the softness of demand based on the weather. Revenues did not come in as we would typically anticipate because of the slowness of the spring season, which caused some of that as well. We don't necessarily have that particularly quantified. We're well staffed across the board but those \u2013 but that staffing without the revenue that's there is going to put some pressure on that as well. Sean Kennedy : Got it. And then one follow-up question on commercial was a little weaker than expected was that due to weather? Or is there anything else to call out there? Eddie Northen : You know, I think if you look at that from kind of the roller-coaster perspective, if you look at it over the last four years you'll see commercial rolling faster then you'll see it a little bit slower then you'll see faster and a little bit slower. I think we just had a quarter that was a little bit off from what we've seen in some of the previous years. If you look back in 2018 and even 2017, we had some pretty strong commercial numbers that we saw. Sean Kennedy : Great. That's it for me. Good luck with the rest of the year. Eddie Northen : Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Hi. Thank you very much. In the fourth quarter you gave us guidance about the tax rate for the year at 26%. How do I think about the cadence of that tax playing out for the remainder of the year given the 21% in 1Q? Eddie Northen : Yes. So we will get to around that 26% for the full year. 2018 was similar in fashion where Q1 was the lowest tax rate that we had for the year and then the subsequent quarters Q3 and four brought us back to that total numbers. So I would anticipate a cadence based on everything we know right now that would be similar in nature to that. And of course, last year the tax rate was at 18% with some extraordinary items that impacted that and the tax rate this year 21% lower than the full 26%, but still again higher than last year. But we believe that the subsequent quarters should level that out for the full year up to 26%. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then the revenues shortfall have you quantified for yourself how much was \u2013 branch was close we couldn't do this service versus we didn't get a new customer and so you understand \u2013 maybe that branches closing and you didn't get the work done but it's going to get done? How much of that number that shows up in 2Q? Eddie Northen : Yes. We've not taken the time to grow through and break that down. That \u2013 it's really going to be demand that is pent-up. And as Gary talked about earlier, we seen the least of the phones ringing much more aggressively and its A - it's a stuff that we'll see in the upcoming months. As I mentioned April is off to a good start for us and as that warm weather comes the demand will come through. The good news is that John and team are well prepared and they are well-staffed well-trained ready to go for that. Michael Hoffman : Right. And may I squeeze one other and what's your borrowing costs so we can do our own analysis of when we can get Clark closed and all that and figure out what's kind of happen on the balance sheet? Eddie Northen : Yes. So we do want just one follow-up, but we will have the term loan tied to LIBOR and then the credit line will be slightly higher than that. But once we finish and close we'll give you some more details on that. Michael Hoffman : LIBOR plus what? Eddie Northen : What? We'll give you more when we close. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : So, Sean and Mike each asked the question, I'm just going to try ask it one more time. How much did weather impact your top line results in the first quarter? Eddie Northen : Well, we don't like to say the word weather and Gary kind of opened with that, it's the reality. As good as we are at being involved with that and as far as the different quarters are concerned mother nature still does her thing. And in this case, it's by far the coldest that we've seen in several years. We staffed as appropriate for a relative normal year. And in -- like an example that I gave. Pasadena is snowing, Las Vegas is snowing. There was more rain in Los Angeles and in Southern California than there was in Seattle during the first quarter. So, it's just anomalies that just occurred that we're not accustomed to. When it rains every day in Southern California, we can't do termite work. We can't do a lot of pest work that we can do in those types of situations. And then when it's snowing in places or polar vortex cold in Chicago was minus 20, we're not digging trenches for termite when it's minus 20 degrees. So, we don't have a number that's going to quantify that. It's just very different than what we seen in the past several years. Gary is in this longer than any of us. So may you put some more color on it? Gary Rollins : I'm not. I mean, it's painful when it's the first quarter. The good news is, is if you had stumbled this is the one to do it on, because of the size of the quarter. But I'd like to add one thing we spent a lot of time developing our bonus plans for our managers and leaders. And our plans are settled quarterly and -- but they also have an annual checker, so our people get back in the game. I mean, you can have a bad quarter, but still pull it out and that's been very helpful. So, we don't have anybody depressed or suicidal. It's just a matter of bad situation and it's very difficult to just determine the impact of not being get to the customers and not having the leads which is important part of our business. I mean, I would really imagine that even a mathematical genius would have a hard time trying to figure that out. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. That makes sense. Thanks for the additional color. Garry, I appreciate that. Just -- my other one, Eddie you said April is off to a good start, right? Eddie Northen : That's correct. Tim Mulrooney : So, if I'm looking at the second quarter which I know is a critical period for you guys, could weather potentially be a tailwind this year? Am I remembering correctly that last year had a delayed spring pest season? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Well, the -- I'll ask John to weigh in on this as well. But the thing that I would add is whenever there is extreme moisture, once that dries up it creates a significant demand on the pest side. And warmer weather are good for us as long as long as the wet dries up enough for pest to proliferate. So, I would say that we would have opportunities, especially in those areas that have significant rain or other moisture whether it's snow in the first quarter, we'll see the benefits of that trailing, I would say, this quarter and the following. John Wilson : Yes. I think all of those things, Tim I mean we're seeing a pent-up demand. We had $1 million day in our call center, which handles residential pest sales for us on Monday. We hadn't had one of those this early or in April since 2017. So plenty of pent-up demand, our teams are well prepared to handle that. I think it'll be a much better quarter for us, no doubt. Gary Rollins : The encouraging part to me, which John talked about during his part of the call. The employee retention is significant improvement, which has helped us with our customer retention is significant improvement. So now we go into this pent-up demand time period with higher employee retention, well-trained technicians and we're going to be ready to rock and roll with the demand that is there. So that's the encouraging part to me is how well prepared we are for what's about to happen or what's happening right now. Tim Mulrooney : Great. Thank you, and good luck in the spring. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti Capital. Please go ahead. Chris McGinnis : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gary Rollins : Morning. Chris McGinnis : Just maybe to follow-up on that. Does that pent-up demand puts stress at all on the system? Can you maybe just highlight that how better positioned you might be given the kind of the weaker trends in Q1? Eddie Northen : Well, from me you don't have a situation where we're going to have to hire additional new people and have then trained as this demand continues to increase. With the employee retention, again that John talked about and that we've had. We have the productivity and the efficiency already in the network that will enable us to be able to I believe -- I strongly believe to be able to digest it easily. So it's not that the demand is increasing and we're having to add new stuff and having to train them and get them up to speed. These people are already on the payroll, they're already trained, they are ready to go. And I think we'll be more efficient than what we -- maybe would be if we were still adding people during this time period. Gary Rollins : I'd like to add one thing, Eddie, which is also important about the retention. Although you do save on the search and the training, you also save as far as management time. And I think that's an important consideration, because it takes a certain amount of management time to go through that sourcing and training and energy in training. So they'll have more time to really work on our businesses forward. Chris McGinnis : Thanks for that. And then just a lot of acquisitions in 2018. Can you maybe just talk about how those businesses are trending versus maybe as you want just call the legacy business as well in the quarter? Thanks. Eddie Northen : Yes. From an acquisition perspective, once a year we have a summit to come together to go through all the acquisitions we've had for the previous years. So we track those on a monthly basis to make sure that we are seeing the benefits that we should see. At this point in time we're very happy. If you look outside of -- just the Orkin, U.S. operation, you look at our Specialty Brands and our international operations for Q1, they performed very well for us and we don't -- we're not going to break anything out, we're not going to give any specifics of anything. But they performed very well for us. And in some cases those were newer acquisitions, the OPC newer acquisition, Northwest newer acquisition. We've increased our footprint in the U.K., Singapore last year, newer acquisition that have all performed very well for us. And I think seeing those has helped the overall distribution of what we have as far as revenue and profitability. So, I think overall we're in a good spot and I think in a great spot as far as growth for the future. Chris McGinnis : Great. Thanks for that color and good luck in Q2. Eddie Northen : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from James Clement with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Clement : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. James Clement : Can you hear me? Gary Rollins : Yes. Go ahead. James Clement : Okay, great. Guys I want to ask you I saw -- I don't know how long it's been on TV, but I saw one of the Orkin commercials featuring like the baby nursery. I kind of thought that was a little bit different in terms of tone than some of your other ad campaigns in the years past which were a little bit more outrageous, whether it's a guy wearing a bug costume and holding a pizza box and that kind of thing. Any intents behind sort of the change in vibe there? Eddie Northen : Well. I think we were trying to -- and I'll let John help out with this, but I think the intent was to pull in all of the different support that we give to our customers. And I think if you look at the many different types of ads that are out there, we talk about lots of different scenarios where our customers need our help and our support. And for me, the most favorite one is the female technician that is part of the family. And they show her in the house, they show her help them with the kids homework and they show her making breakfast and stuff. They just consider her to be a part of their family an extension of their family. And I think that's more of what we're trying to get to is how supportive we are with people's lifestyle. And by creating a safe customary environment and by creating an environment on the outside of a home that are customary and mosquito free enable people to live their lives in a different way. And having Orkin be a part of that, I think it's really what -- part of what it was that we were trying to create. James Clement : Okay. John Wilson : Yes, Jamie I would add. So the messaging is all about pest control is an ongoing necessity as opposed to an emergency type of situation. To your point about the big bug holding the pizza box that... James Clement : Which I loved by the way I absolutely love that to see it now. John Wilson : No doubt, but it was really about -- the messaging was about only calling us when you have a need, right. Whereas now the messaging is about in order to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle, pest control is kind of a necessity as opposed to that only call when you have a need. So that's kind of the messaging and then the other piece of the new advertising is it's attention getting. I mean, I was in a hotel in Chicago and I had the television on the news channel and all of a sudden the television kind of went silent. And after a few seconds I looked up and then it was one of our ads and it was the one with all of the adults on the back deck having a party. And they we're talking in a muffled, which by and large there wasn't much sound coming from the commercial. And they told me to look up to see what was going on and about the time I looked up the ad was ending and the Orkin logo showed up. And so it went a lot of quarter we're trying to get -- grab people's attention with that move. And it's -- I think it will pay off for us it's proven successful early on. We've got some really good reviews on it. Gary Rollins : Okay. I think if I might add one thing. We do a lot of testing. And so, there would be several creative initiatives that were stopped or discontinued and we select what we feel is going to be the best one and if you're watching television or the commercials or cable or whatever, you can just see a similar situation with major advertisers. They are just looking to grab the audience and deliver their message, but if you can't grab them, it doesn't matter what your message is. So we're hopeful and time will tell. James Clement : I appreciate that. Eddie real quick, your comments around the range of growth in intangible amortization, were you giving it back to the fact that you're only talking about eight months of 2019? Or were you did meaning on like an annualized basis? Eddie Northen : So that would be the impact -- once we make the acquisition that will be the impact, there will be a range of the impacts on a quarterly basis. James Clement : Okay. So like a year-over-year basis? Eddie Northen : Correct. James Clement : Okay, okay. Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Eddie Northen : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi. Just, you gave a bunch of data, which on the phone was breaking up unfortunately. So I didn't know whether it was -- you gave big growth rates. I think you gave us the totals, that 4.9%, 4.6%, 4.8%, the next group, was that organic, the 4.5%, 2.5% and 4.3% res, comm and termite? Eddie Northen : That is correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. I couldn't. The phones were breaking up unfortunately. So inside that 4.5% to -- and all those numbers, because of the weather and the disruptions, is virtually all of that retained business and add-on services, plus prices versus new customer adds? Eddie Northen : Well, we'll have new customer adds in certain parts of the country. I think the majority will come from the categories that you mentioned. But there are -- there's certain parts of the country that were less impacted by the weather than others. I mean if you look at the Midwest, they were probably the most impacted, then I would probably say California is where it kind of followed that. But there were other areas of the country that were less impacted and we would have new customer growth that will come from here. Michael Hoffman : And that's why you're saying that retention across all three businesses improved year-over-year, because -- in each of the biz segments, because you're part of getting the number -- the organic growth number, you worry you had to improve the quality of the retention too, right, given the disruption in new leads. Eddie Northen : That\u2019s right. Michael Hoffman : Okay. So that\u2019s why I was trying to get it right. All right. Eddie Northen : Yes. So the -- so we -- again, we believe that the tie between the improvement and the employee retention, again, that John talked about is always a great correlation for us on customer retention and we've seen that now a couple of quarters in a row, where we've seen some pretty healthy improvement. Michael Hoffman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to our speakers. Gary Rollins : Great. Thank you. Okay. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to updating you on our progress in the second quarter call. Thanks, again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference call. The call has now concluded. Please disconnect your lines and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Marilyn Meek. Ms. Meek, you may begin. Marilyn Meek : Thank you. By now, you should have all received a copy of the press release. However, if anyone is missing a copy and would like to receive one, please contact our office at 212-827-3746, and we will send you a release and make sure you are on the Company\u2019s distribution list. There will be a replay of the call, which will begin one hour after the call and run for one week. The replay can be accessed by dialing 1-888-203-1112, with the passcode 9599376. Additionally, the call is being webcast at www.viavid.com, and a replay will be available for 90 days. On the line with me today and presenting are Gary Rollins, Rollins\u2019 Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Rollins\u2019 President and Chief Operating Officer; and Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we\u2019ll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes, Marilyn. Thank you and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2019 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we\u2019ll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on the call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. As you would expect, we\u2019ve disappointed with our performance for the quarter. We, like most other pest control companies, have both strong and weaker growth periods with some seasonal timing uncertainty. Unfortunately, our situation is not like retail where everyone knows when Christmas comes. Historically, we had handled these weaker periods by adjusting our cost or headcount after the season to the more appropriate level. This year was unique because of the fact that the season was very late. Thankfully, July looks strong. So we have a make-up opportunity. For the second quarter, revenues rose 9.1% to $524.2 million, compared to revenues of $480.5 million in the second quarter of last year. Net income declined 3.3% to $63.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $65 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year. When adjusted for the one-time Clark acquisition expense and the foreign currency exchange, it would be $0.21 per share. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other financial results in a few minutes. Revenues for the first six months rose 7.2% to $953.2 million, compared to $889.2 million for the same period last year. Net income decreased 5.6% to approximately $107.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $114.1 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.35 for the first six months of last year. We have a number of initiatives that will enhance Rollins\u2019 future growth and margin improvement. I\u2019d like to talk more specifically about these business improvements and how they will impact Rollins. As we approach becoming a multi-billion dollar company, the time is right to make strategic investments that will prepare us for the future. Some of these business investments and innovations are, as you recall, we improved our 401(k) and broadened stock grants at 2018 year-end. We estimate that this is an additional expense of $6 million for 2019. But we believe that there is not a better use of our resources. As a people business, our ability to recruit and retain excellent employees is paramount. This investment has helped generate a strong improvement in employee retention for our first two quarters. Next, we\u2019ve increased and expanded our investment in customer routing and scheduling. This technology directly benefits our employees and customers. We now guide our technician to the customer\u2019s address with the service day, it\u2019s plan from start to finish. The technicians have better organized days and our customers receive better communication and appointment reliability. Our most recent technical innovation in this area is the adoption of Glympse, a software that enables us to communicate with the customer via text or email as to their upcoming service date and time of service. Our customers now even have the ability to see where there technician is when en route to their account. As a result of these tools, we have created a better relationship with our customers and a better job for our technicians. The customer is better served and has the capability to change their service day and time as their circumstances dictate. This investment has also contributed to our employees and customers retention improvements and reduction of miles driven. As you recall from our earlier calls that we are transitioning our pension to an insurance provider. When complete, this will create a significant administrative expense savings. Eddie will discuss this more details about this initiative in a few minutes. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve made and are making these improvements and innovations to better prepare for the Company\u2019s future and to help mitigate some of the challenges we experienced due to the seasonality of our business. Expanding our recurring revenue accomplishes this. As you would expect, there has been a significant amount of expenditures and effort that are associated with these initiatives that have and will have a positive effect on the company. I would add that our Company\u2019s track record has shown that we don\u2019t have a Spend Yourself Rich culture at Rollins. And we expect a favorable return on our new and improved program. With the Clark acquisition complete, we will continue to evaluate other acquisition prospects as adding great companies and brands will remain one of our primary objectives. John will now update you on the Clark acquisition and our other plans. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. We believe our track record with our acquired companies speaks to the success we\u2019ve had in integrating and growing acquisitions made over the past 19 years, all of which have contributed in many ways to our profitable growth. Historically, the larger acquisitions require a bit longer to integrate, as you might expect, and that will apply to Clark as well. Once fully incorporated though, the long-term benefits of these acquisitions provide excellent top and bottom line growth expansion of our company and the ability to provide customers with additional pest control related services. These acquired companies benefit from our Internet experience, greater purchasing power and transferable technology. Clark is on track with our business plan and we expect them to be a highly successful addition to our family of brands. Gary and I are heading out there next week when we will meet with their team and check in on their progress. We are excited about Clark, as the majority of their branches are in Northern California and their addition dramatically strengthens our Company\u2019s presence in this area. As you may recall, we ended 2018 with the best employee retention we\u2019d experienced in our recent history, and in the first two quarters of 2019, continued on that trajectory. Further, as you would expect, employee retention directly correlates with customer retention. Improving and enhancing the benefit package for our team members obviously helps retain our people. However, investments in technology and process helps greatly here too. As we have slightly \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 as we have simply improved team member job satisfaction with these various tools. A service technician\u2019s relationship with their customers is extremely important to ensuring customer loyalty and expanding our customer base. As Gary has shared, our customer routing and scheduling capabilities are a large contributor to improvement in this area as it enables technicians to expand their service time. This enables them to better fulfill their customers\u2019 needs, and in some cases, add additional customers to their route. For our field personnel, this technology provides additional benefits in the form of reducing the amount of time spent behind the wheel. For the second quarter, we again had nice improvements in driving efficiency as measured by miles per stop. Average miles driven per stop in our Orkin fleet were down 4% year-over-year and we have had 17 consecutive months of miles per stop reductions. One last item related to technology, we gained full implementation of our human resource information system during the first half of the year and this system when fully utilized solves a number of pain points for our field employees. We expect to see continued benefits through 2019 and beyond from these various technology initiatives mentioned. On another note, this time of year, we get a lot of questions about how our mosquito business is doing, although a relatively small part of our overall business at this point, this service line continues to grow and is in part driven by increased concern and public awareness around disease-borne issues including Zika, West Nile, and other diseases. Year-over-year, our mosquito service has grown over 35% and we expect continued growth in the future as we gain greater cross-sell penetration of our large pest control customer base. Now, let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. I\u2019ll begin our Q1 call discussing the strength of April only to have May and June demand look significantly different. We come to you again sharing what we know at this point with some pent-up demand from previous quarters coming through so far in July. Our second quarter results can be defined by looking at the past, the present and the future. Each of these time periods have a significant piece of the results that we are reporting to you today and will continue to build on results for quarters and years to come. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included significant negative currency exchange through a stronger U.S. dollar and our growing international business, continued year-to-date improvements in both employee and customer retention, and uneven pest demand that Gary mentioned in the opening. To be more specific, the past events of our investment in enhanced benefits for our employees will impact this quarter by about $1.9 million, $1.5 million for the 401(k) and $400,000 for the special restricted stock, and about $1.75 million for the remaining quarters of 2019 as we add Clark to our 401(k) plan. While the vesting of the special stock grants was a one-time event this year, the 401(k) will be impacted moving forward by employees joining and leaving the plan or increasing or reducing their contribution as we move forward. John just spoke about the lasting outcome that this investment has made on our employee retention, which is the key driver to our long-term success. Again, as a reminder, these items impact both CSP and SG&A, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. In addition to the items that Gary and John mentioned a few minutes ago, our present and future is and will be significantly impacted by our acquisition of Clark. We\u2019re on pace with our integration and have already made positive changes related to vehicles, procurement and benefits plants. Clark will go live on our fleet systems the second week of August, which will be a step to getting their fleet operating margins more in line with Rollins\u2019 levels. Based on past acquisitions, we have the opportunity to improve the fleet margins over 20%. Our Rollins\u2019 support staff have visited with Clark in Lodi, California, and we are learning so much. On my recent visit, I had a chance to listen to customer calls and I was truly impressed with their call center function, the interaction with the customers and its efficiency. When I visited the Stockton branch, I gained a deeper understanding of how they run their operations at such an impressively high level. Since that time, several Clark employees have visited Atlanta to learn more about Rollins and how they can support our integration efforts. In addition to the reduced fleet expense, other items that will impact the P&L in Q3 and Q4 related to Clark are, depreciation will be up $1.9 million per quarter for buildings and vehicles added. We have received a draft of the valuation of Clark and including Clark as well as the other 40-plus acquisitions that we made over the last 18 months, amortization has increased $8.8 million. We are in a position to share more details related to the purchase interest expense now that we have worked through some of the specifics. For Q2, we had $1.9 million of interest for the partial quarter of borrowings. For Q3, we estimate $2.7 million, as we have already started paying down the loans and have added an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the loan at a rate of roughly 45 bps below LIBOR. We will continue to pay down the loans and estimate a reduction in interest expense to $2.5 million for Q4. Again, we\u2019ve already started to pay off the outstanding loans and our plans are to be debt-free by early 2022. Finally, professional services were up $1.9 million for Q2, significantly higher than originally anticipated at the time of our Q1 call due to an in-depth regulatory review and the need for economic experts to support our case for acquisition as well as expertise related to the real estate transactions. There will be an additional $400,000 of expense related to this in Q3 and we anticipate nothing in Q4. For those of you that had a chance to review the release of our 8-K related to the Clark audited 2018 financials, I wanted to share some additional detail. From the bottom line results that were shared, there are approximately $11 million, which will be excluded as we move forward in time. $5.7 million of that is for rents that are no longer paid since we now own the properties, an additional $2.4 million on elimination of vehicles and transportation and then other expenses in addition. These expenses were normal private company expenses and there was agreement to make these changes prior to the finalizing of the acquisition. There will be several margin points of gains from these changes that will be added to the additional changes that we add from our integration of the business previously mentioned. One additional item where the Clark deal will have benefits will be in our free cash flow. Including the acquisition and the benefits of Clark, we will have approximately a $40 million increase in free cash flow for 2019. Even with lower than average net income in Q1 and Q2, this increase is in line with the previous few years. For 2019, as we\u2019ve shared on prior calls, the earnings per share will be flat, but we believe the deal will be accretive by half a penny for the full year of 2020. Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenues of $524 million was an increase of 9.1% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter revenue of $480.5 million. There was an accounting change that increased our franchise revenue recognition last year by approximately $1.5 million, that did not occur in 2019. Income before income taxes improved from Q1, but decreased 3.6% to $87 million from $90.2 million in 2018. Favorable expense adjustments were made, but demand still lagged in several areas during the quarter. This impacted all of our subsequent financial metrics as well. Net income fell 1.9% to $64.3 million. Earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, in line with $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $109 million, up 2.2% over Q2 2018. EBITDA is the best measure for the near term with the addition of Clark. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 showed was $953 million, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter revenues of $889.2 million. Income before income taxes decreased 4.3% to $143 million from $149.4 million in 2018. Net income fell 4.9% to $108.5 million and earnings per share was $0.33, down 5.7% from the 2018 number of $0.35. EBITDA was $181.5 million, down seven-tenths of a percent compared to 2018. I detailed out some of the past and the present. Now, let\u2019s turn our discussion to the future. As first mentioned several quarters ago, we are in the final stages of transitioning our fully funded pension plan off of our books. There are so many positive impacts from this step, which include managing the volatility of the assets, the elimination of that, the elimination of the annual $5 million payment to fund the plan and the elimination of the daily administrative management of the plan. In addition, since our plan is approximately 104% funded, which equates to roughly $6 million, these assets will be deployed in other areas of our business that will be discussed on our Q3 earnings call. Most of the financial impact from the pension transition will occur in Q3. First, we will have a significant non-cash charge of approximately $76 million pre-tax, which will be pension expense in Q3 which will equate to approximately $0.20 per share after taxes. This $76 million expense is the accounting treatment of the accumulated sum of unrealized losses associated with our plan. Net of tax, the loss will be approximately $64 million. The tax treatment is consistent with the method other companies would apply. The tax effect from the transition of the pension plan will be a reduction in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and for the year. Let\u2019s take a l.ook through the Rollins\u2019 revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 9.1% included 5.5% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 3.6% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up a 11.1%, commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 7.7%, and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.6%, and from that, residential was up 4.6%, commercial increased 2.8%, and termite and ancillary grew 4.6%. In total, gross margin was down slightly to 51.7% from 52% prior year\u2019s quarter. The quarter experienced increases in most expenses due to acquisitions as well as in administrative salaries due to amortization of the employee special restricted share grants from the prior year and increased salaries. Service salaries, materials and supplies and fleet increased with production for the period. Taking out these one-time items, gross margin would have been 51.8%. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $3.8 million to $20.1 million, an increase of 12.9%. Depreciation increased $1.5 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.2 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $18.5 million or 12.9% to $161.9 million or 30.9% of revenues, up 1.1 percentage point from $143.4 million or 29.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2019. The increase in the percent of revenues, as I discussed, is primarily due to acquisitions and the amortization of restricted shares from the 2018 special grant distribution and increases in the 401(k) expense. Taking out these one-time items, SG&A would have been 30.3%. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2019, we spent $414.8 million on acquisitions, compared to $54.6 million the same period last year. We paid $68.7 million on dividends and had $13.4 million of CapEx, which was up 5.7% in 2018 primarily from planned IT upgrades, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $67.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business August 9, 2019. The cash dividend is a 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We\u2019re happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much for taking the questions. I have a big macro question that within is about the pest control market broadly. Do you believe that you\u2019re beginning to see a secular decline in the overall underlying growth rate \u2013 organic growth rate, and then it will be part of a cycle, we\u2019ve had an improvement tied to an improving economic cycle starting to slow, is the overall market growing slower? Eddie Northen : Yes, Michael. This is Eddie. I don\u2019t know that we have any insights that would change what we believe will continue to be a growth market as we move forward in time. I think current weather patterns have moved things on one side and the other. Over the previous few years, current weather patterns, warmer during the warmer seasons and I think we\u2019ve seen growth occurred during those times. I think that you actually highlighted some of the weather patterns that we\u2019ve seen over the first part of this year in certain areas at least in the U.S. and I think we\u2019ve seen adjustments with that. So, I don\u2019t know that we know anything or see anything secular in nature or different in nature other than what we\u2019ve seen. Michael Hoffman : Okay, thank you. John Wilson : And I think one advantage that we have is what we now have about 400 branches in North America. So, we really didn\u2019t see from coast to coast and certainly as Eddie said that weather has a lot to do with how the season starts and we\u2019re just not seeing an overall decrease as far as demand is concerned. Michael Hoffman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then switching gears to Clark and I\u2019ll come back into the queue. I just want to be clear on the comment you shared with us, Eddie. So there is a \u2013 in the 8-K there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m rounding there is approximately $9 million of reported income by Clark and you\u2019re suggesting that you have $11 million that you can add back to that because of underlying, it was vehicles and \u2013 forgetting the other item, you pulled out here, as I\u2019m looking through my notes, vehicles and rents were $8 million of that, but there is $11 million. So I\u2019m looking at $20 million as a starting number. Is that the right way to think about it on the way you\u2019d run the business before any other adjustments? Eddie Northen : I think that\u2019s a fair way thinking about it. Yes. Michael Hoffman : Okay. I\u2019ll come back in the queue. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Dan. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Dan Dolev : I was a little bit \u2013 hey, good morning. I was a little bit surprised on the commercial side that I think the comp was a little bit easier. I\u2019m not wrong; you did about 2.8% organic growth in that sub-segment that\u2019s quite a bit lower than if I look historically, you\u2019re averaging 4%, 3%. Is there anything we should be concerned about regarding competitive pressure from your larger competitor that\u2019s being more aggressive on that side? I can\u2019t help is that \u2013 is the weather impact in commercial like it impacts residential? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes. So, Dan, I would say, looking at a year ago, we grew 4.2%, that\u2019s a pretty hefty number on the commercial side, and I would say that one of the things that we saw in the quarter was fumigation and that was just from some individual jobs and customers that just didn\u2019t come through and fumigation is a piece of what we do on the commercial side, it\u2019s not tariff related, it\u2019s not anything else like that, it\u2019s just actual jobs that didn\u2019t come through that we have historically seen. So, it wasn\u2019t competitive in nature at all. When we went through and looked at what those impacts were over that time period, it was rounding to a percent for us on the commercial side. So, we\u2019ve made adjustments, where we can in the operations with that, but that\u2019s something historically, we\u2019ve not seen kind of moves like that. So, no competitive concerns at this point, a little bit of a higher comp from a year ago and the fumigation piece. Dan Dolev : Got it. And just a separate question, we\u2019ve done some survey work here that show that obviously, the customer satisfaction is very good and people that like the Orkin service really like the customer satisfaction. But on the other hand, it felt like pricing matters more than what I had expected. It is \u2013 this industry has been known for almost infinite price inelasticity. Have you noticed any changes in anything push back from customers on the price increases? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yes, thanks for that. We\u2019ve not seen issues with that. I think as you know we\u2019ve talked about, I think our marketing group is very robust and they\u2019re testing, so that we want to know and understand what sort of temperature we\u2019ll have when it comes to rolling out our price in individual markets and in individual areas, because we do not want to lose customer for price, because the lifetime value of the customer is the most important thing to us. So, I think we feel comfortable with the testing that\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t know of any material push back that we\u2019ve had. Our pricing is relatively in line with what we\u2019ve seen in previous years. And again, as we mentioned on the call, our customer retention numbers continue to improve. So, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re seeing issues or concerns or problems at this point in time in that area. Gary Rollins : Eddie, if I could, we\u2019re very fortunate in our call center that we have \u2013 that we can verify really if there\u2019s any pricing issues with our closure. So, we kind of have a laboratory, if you will, that you have the same people kind of handling these calls from the Northeast and the Midwest and so forth and so on. So, we\u2019re able to track closure literally by region and division. Dan Dolev : Got it. Thank you, Gary. Appreciate it. Thanks, Ed. Eddie Northen : Thanks, Dan. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Jamie Clement with Buckingham. Jamie Clement : Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Jamie Clement : Right. I was just curious if I could get your thoughts. I think this was \u2013 this has been an unusual year in the sense that from our perspective, the industry has faced some unusual weather in both the first and the second quarters, and what I was curious about was, if in local markets, some of your competitors and everybody, who has found it hard to generate leads in the first quarter, do they tend to spend more trying to generate leads in the second quarter? Did you notice any of that? And how do you all strategically respond? Do you try to match them or you just kind of stick with the blueprint? Eddie Northen : I think we\u2019ll stick with the blueprint, the marketing really has to go through and figure out ways to be innovative when it comes to that acquisition cost per lead and then it\u2019s on us to be able to make sure that we\u2019re doing what we tend to close the lead from there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything different having to do with even the price necessarily for that in total. Now, there are some channels obviously that are more expensive, but our marketing group, I think again, it\u2019s doing a great job by going and finding other channels to be able to create some of those leads and it\u2019s just a matter of, is there enough demand there for the lead? And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily that we\u2019re not winning leads. I think, it\u2019s just been the demand that is there and the leads not being available to us. Jamie Clement : Okay. Thank you. And Eddie, I\u2019m not sure I caught this. were you saying that depreciation as a result of Clark would be up about $1.9 million sequentially from Q2 to Q3? Eddie Northen : I don\u2019t think I said that about depreciation. Jamie Clement : Okay. Basically, I was trying to get is sort of like, what\u2019s the current all-in quarterly D&A number post-Clark? Eddie Northen : Yes. We did say it was up $1.5 million year-over-year. Jamie Clement : I thought there was a different number you gave about Q story and I didn\u2019t know if that was cumulative, I just was \u2013 just because you know it\u2019s non-cash and I just wanted to make sure that there are no just modeling errors. Eddie Northen : We\u2019ll go back and we\u2019ll look at the transcript and we\u2019ll share that with you. How about that? Jamie Clement : Okay, all right, great. And yes, just a general comment, Gary, how the international businesses are performing? Gary Rollins : They are performing well. We\u2019re very pleased. We\u2019ve had some challenges in Australia, but we seem to have turned the corner there, their economy has not been as robust as we have here in North America, but we\u2019re very pleased with UK, we\u2019re very pleased with our operation in Singapore. And so I think all in all, we\u2019re pleased with our international business. Jamie Clement : Or more international acquisition is very much on the table? Gary Rollins : I think so. We continue to have candidates. And I think our track record is \u2013 has helped us understand what we can expect and when we can expect it. So, I think we\u2019re a little bit more robust than we were before, but we\u2019re really pleased, and one of the great things is that \u2013 is these people that have built these businesses have stayed. So, we don\u2019t have to learn the culture and all other things that a local individual is already extremely familiar with. And I think that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s been a blessing and we also have a position that we can refer a candidate to our other acquired companies. Jamie Clement : Right. Gary Rollins : And that\u2019s helped us a long ways, because I think we get good results or good feedback that we don\u2019t go in and try to change everything or change everybody that\u2019s patient, and we try to cheer things if we think would benefit them, but we\u2019ve not taken a heavy hand and I think that goes a long way when you\u2019re trying to acquire companies. Jamie Clement : Okay. thank you all very much for your time and I appreciate it. Eddie Northen : Hey, Jamie, to close the loop, I did mention, I just want to make sure the total depreciation versus what we called out for Clark, we did say up $1.9 million per quarter for building the vehicles having to do with Clark. Jamie Clement : And that\u2019s \u2013 so that was second quarter year-over-year? Eddie Northen : That\u2019s correct. Jamie Clement : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Eddie Northen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now move to Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning. Eddie, you and Gary and John, you guys thrown a lot of numbers out of this morning on the margins, if you could exclude Clark for a second, just stepping back here, I kind of thought margins would have been heading up higher this year with the roll-off of some of your IT expenditures, maybe, a more normalized growth of recurring revenue customers, but it appears like maybe there are more headwinds here, other things to consider offsetting some of these benefits. Could you just step back for us and kind of give us the major puts and takes on margin in 2019 and how we should think about \u2013 how we should think about the major puts and takes overall I guess? Thank you. Eddie Northen : Tim, I think if you take \u2013 if you take Clark out, the benefit piece is going to be one of the larger pieces that we\u2019re going to have that will be out there, that as you know, it wasn\u2019t something we thought was going to be a headwind expense-wise, we thought we would be flat to the previous year. But with our improved usage of the plan, more people joining the plan, more people increasing their match in the plan that has been an additional expense for us. But the other piece of it is it\u2019s going to be staffing for a season that hasn\u2019t come as normal or as expected. We don\u2019t have a dollar amount for that. We don\u2019t have a dollar amount to give you put and take, having to do with that, but the solid numbers that we have talked about do have to do with the benefit. Tim Mulrooney : All right. That\u2019s helpful. How do you think about margin on a go-forward or a long-term basis? Do you think this business tops out in the 20%, 21% EBITDA margin range? Or is there more room to run through stronger density and tech investments and stuff like that? Eddie Northen : I think coming from the density background, that\u2019s before Gary convinced me to make the best decision in my life after marrying my wife was learning and understanding the importance of density and every single time John and Group find and acquire a mountain top company, they find and acquire a regional company that we end up rolling into another existing brand or organization, we get a little bit more depth, we get a little bit more efficient and we become better every single time that happens. So to me, in an extremely fragmented industry like we have, I think the upside opportunities continue to be out there for years to come. And I think when you double down on that with the technology investments that we have made and the fact on how we are executing on those technology investments at this point in time, with a lot of runway to go, I still think personally there is a lot of upside potential that has to go with that. Tim Mulrooney : So, a lot of runway left, no reason structurally why Rollins\u2019 EBITDA margin tops out at 20%, 21%. Eddie Northen : I don\u2019t believe so. I think there is more room potentially to go as we look forward in time. Tim Mulrooney : Thank you. I just want to squeeze in one more here, because of kind of related to that. Just on the Clark acquisition, if I add back that $11 million to the reported how we calculated EBITDA of $16 million, we get more to a run rate EBITDA for Clark that\u2019s closer to 20% already excluding those $11 million one-time items or items that won\u2019t repeat, am I doing that math right? Are you getting to a go-forward Clark EBITDA margin in the high-teens range? And where do you think you can get that to in a couple of years? Am I doing the math right and how do you think about it long-term? Thank you. Gary Rollins : Yes. I think your math is right. We started calling out some of the things that we are already moving on having to do with improving our vehicle margin. We\u2019re going to be moving those folks over to \u2013 the car folks over to some of our benefits plans, which is going to be a saving. We\u2019ve already started with some of our procurement spend items. So, we know they\u2019re going to be multiple margin points that are going to be in addition to those other items that I called out to be $11 million. The good news is like I had mentioned, we\u2019ve had our support staff out there. We understand what we can move on in the priority of how quickly their needs are. They\u2019ve been here to work through those integration steps and like I said. So even in two weeks, we\u2019re starting with the fleet; we\u2019re going to start moving the fleet piece of it. The 401(k) plan is going to be moving over in August to the Rollins\u2019 401(k) plan, which would be a saving. So there is \u2013 there are multiple opportunities that we believe from a margin perspective, will help in addition to what you lined out. Tim Mulrooney : I understand. Thank you. Good luck in the back half of the year. Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take a follow-up from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : So, there\u2019s two pieces here. One on the \u2013 you gave us an adjusted gross margin of 51.8%, which pulled out all the noise. So, that\u2019s still down year-over-year and yet retention\u2019s better. I\u2019m still struggling with why margins aren\u2019t improving. And then the second part, you gave us an $8 million amortization number, but you didn\u2019t tell us whether that was like quarterly or how does that flow through? So, when I look at D&A, in total, I got $1.9 million for Clark plus what for amortization per quarter? Eddie Northen : Yes. So, Michael, I\u2019ll go back to the first question that you had there. And I think it\u2019s a little bit of what we \u2013 what we responded back to Tim there. We\u2019ve staffed for a season that has not come through as we\u2019ve seen from a normal demand perspective. And as Gary opened up the call, we\u2019re not \u2013 our efficiency isn\u2019t as good as we would normally have it and we\u2019re making adjustments for that, it\u2019s just the abnormality of kind of the way this has fallen. We don\u2019t want to be in a position, where we\u2019re not staffed accordingly for a season, have the season come and then not be able to take care of things from a customer perspective and a long-term customer value perspective. So, we had an abnormality there and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as part of that margin piece. We\u2019re moving forward, we\u2019re making adjustments to that, like I said, July has been off to a good start. Gary Rollins : I\u2019d like to add that, if we\u2019d cut our vehicles and our head count a month ago, we\u2019d really be in bad shape right now. So, whether you like it or not, you\u2019ve just got the hold on and fortunately, I guess, July now is showing that that strategy or those actions were really the right things to do, but it\u2019s very painful when you have that period that you\u2019re not giving your revenue as you were expecting, but you\u2019ve got that incremental expense build up in the form of headcount and vehicles. So that\u2019s really what put more pressure on the margin than any piece other than that. Eddie Northen : And Michael, we\u2019re not going to manage through a quarter, I mean that\u2019s the bottom line of what our company is about and it\u2019s the way that Rollins has been successful for a lot of years and we\u2019re not going to make a short-term decision that might help our margin a 1% or 2% or whatever else like that and then damage the long-term business. We\u2019re not going to do that and that\u2019s unfortunately what we\u2019ve gone through these first two quarters, and to Gary\u2019s point, it\u2019s paying off and we\u2019re seeing the demand that\u2019s coming through and we\u2019re prepared for that. Michael Hoffman : Can I just ask a clarification just so I make sure I understood everything, I get why you are making in the statements you are making, I get the business management reasons for managing the costs the way you did. If the second-half growth rate is a good growth rate, but it\u2019s still organic \u2013 is lower year-over-year, by all rights the margins should expand, because of the way the math of adding new customers, lower margin in the first year, better margin in the second, really good in the third, isn\u2019t that the \u2013 is that the right way to think about that all else being equal? Eddie Northen : That\u2019s exactly the right way to think about it. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Eddie Northen : you\u2019re exactly right with how to think about it and that\u2019s what our expectations would be as we\u2019re moving through the remainder of the year. Michael Hoffman : Okay. thanks. And then just a clarification on the amortization number you gave us. how do I apply it in the model? Eddie Northen : That\u2019s going to be year-over-year increase, is what that\u2019s going to be\u2026 Michael Hoffman : Full 12 months, so divided by 4. Eddie Northen : Correct. Michael Hoffman : Okay. All right. Thanks. Eddie Northen : Yes. I do want to clarify one other thing, Jamie, you had asked your question earlier about the depreciation, I misstated something. So, I just want to clarify that. The $1.9 million for the depreciation for Clark is going to be for Q3 and Q4. For Q2, it was $1.3 million and that\u2019s because we acquired them at the end of April. So, two months out of the quarter. So, I want to make sure that we clarify that. Operator : And we do have a follow-up question from Jamie Clement from Buckingham. Jamie Clement : Eddie, thank you for that. And then just one follow-up question, just reading a little bit of the news about California and some of the like rodenticide situation with the legislation and that kind of thing. Is there like \u2013 is that an opportunity for somebody like you if the industry has to change the protocols? Eddie Northen : Well, that\u2019s a really good question. John\u2019s probably closer to that. John Wilson : Yes, Jamie, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure anybody knows right now. I was reading an article on that just last night. So, we\u2019re not real sure just yet. We do \u2013 there\u2019s obviously, if you take away the second generation rodenticides, the opportunity for the rodent populations to grow pretty dramatically is there. Jamie Clement : Yes. John Wilson : And so that creates opportunity, but it\u2019s unfortunate and we\u2019re as an industry wrestling with that as we speak. But I think there can be opportunity there, just may not be \u2013 it just may not be good for the residents of California. Jamie Clement : Yes, now I get it. Gary Rollins : I think it gets down to how much pressure the public is going to put on these regulators. Of course, rats are pretty onerous and just for appearance, if nothing else. So, it\u2019s going to be interested to see, because I think this is the first legitimate shoot-out that you have between the environmentalists, who think they did the right thing, but apparently by all indications, this has just really backfired. I mean this has unintended consequences and we certainly have more rodent leads than we had, I mean, it\u2019s the respondents of the population, but it\u2019s going to be really interested to see how this thing shapes out. Eddie Northen : Jamie, one other thing, too, they haven\u2019t taken these products away from use in food processing plants. So, they\u2019re still going to be out there and then further to that while you can\u2019t buy them off the shelf in a grocery store in California, you can order them on the Internet and dependent on the number that you look at, we may be taking care of 20%, 25% of the population. The rest is unvended and they\u2019re going to various Internet sources and buying those same products and they\u2019ll still be using them. Jamie Clement : And probably using them \u2013 and using them less responsibly than you\u2019d be using them. Eddie Northen : Exactly right. And that\u2019s been our big issue with the regulation, so... Jamie Clement : Okay. I appreciate all that. Eddie Northen : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. Michael, one other clarification for you having to do with the amortization kind of similar to back to the question that Tim had having to do with the depreciation and I misstated. So, the amortization for the quarter was about $2.2 million, but we only had two months of Clark as part of that. So, the amortization, as we move forward per month year-over-year, will be slightly higher than that. So, just because \u2013 so obviously, we\u2019ll have what, three months, going to be in there, but I just want to clarify that. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our progress in these numerous new programs and initiatives that we\u2019re taking, and also the fact that the season this quarter certainly is starting strong and we would hope that that will continue throughout the quarter. Thank you. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference and we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On the line with me today and presenting are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer; and Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks and then we'll open up the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes, Marilynn. Thank you and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our third quarter 2019 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we'll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information and the Risk Factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Well first and foremost, we're pleased with our third quarter execution and results across all of our business service lines. The warm weather finally appeared thankfully, although later than normal. As a result, we experienced a strong delayed demand for our pest control services. Following a less than satisfactory second quarter, we work diligently to ensure that we right-sized our headcount and reduced expenses that weren't essential for the quarter. We're proud that our team responded effectively. It's also noteworthy that many of our investments and programs continue to generate improved levels of employee retention. This is an important step to improving customer service in the field and administration. In addition to earlier this month, we completed the transition of our fully funded U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. This will provide our company with several accomplishments. We will be eliminating the annual pension contribution, insurance fees, administrative cost, pension management and other related cost of the plan. There will be ongoing cash savings. Our employees since freezing of the plan in 2006 have enjoyed significant enhancements to their benefits, most recently to their 401(k) plan. Eddie will provide more detail on the pension discontinuation in his remarks. Record revenues for the quarter rose 14.1% to $556.5 million, compared to revenues of $487.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Diluted net income of $44.1 million or $0.13 per share was impacted by the non-cash pension settlement cost that compares to $66.6 million or $0.20 in 2018. Revenues for the first nine months rose 9.6% to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.377 billion for the same period last year. Net income was approximately $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $180.7 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.56 for the first nine months of last year. Eddie will review the non-GAAP results shortly as they're very meaningful. We experienced strong growth in all of our business lines in the quarter with residential, up 17.6%, commercial pest control rose 9.2%, and termite and ancillary services grew 15.4%. We believe our third quarter results reflect both the resiliency of our company and our team's ability to respond to operational challenges. Before turning the call over to John, just a quick update on Clark. John and I visit began with the team in California this quarter and the more time we spend with Clark and their employees the more excited we are about having them as a member to our family of brands. We're making great strides with our integration as they are now live on our fleet system, fully transitioned into our 401(k) program and improving their telecom systems. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. With the warmer weather experienced during the third quarter, mosquitoes among other pests were much more active. Even as the population is becoming more aware of the health threats of mosquitoes, there is still much to be done in this area. Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile, Zika and other diseases caused by mosquito bites are becoming a greater health threat. We continue to work with various agencies and organizations in an effort to educate the public about these mosquito risks. In order to meet this public threat, we have worked persistently over the years to add mosquito services in all branch locations. This year, we have grown that service line by more than 30% and this has helped greatly to propel us to our 6.4% overall organic growth rate for the quarter. Additionally, we know that coupling these and other service offerings together for our customers, clearly lengthens our relationship with that customer increasing the revenue received. Now I'd like to share with you some exciting news regarding one of our brands. Northwest Exterminating, last week at the National Pest Management Association meetings, Northwest received the National Pest Management Association Gives Award. The NPMA Gives Award recognizes member companies that have demonstrated leadership through dedication and contribution to their community. Rollins has increasingly encouraged our brands to give back to their communities and Northwest has certainly led the way in this effort. We are proud of this recognition and want to congratulate our team at Northwest. In 2006, Northwest introduced their Green Pest Control program, which is a rather unique service offering targeting common household pests, ants, spiders, roaches, mice, centipedes, millipedes and more, using only high-quality nontoxic products derived from botanicals, such as flowers, plants and natural elements from the earth, as well as an IPM or Integrated Pest Management approach utilizing exclusion techniques to keep pests out in the first place. Over time this program has expanded to include a Green Elite offering as well as other Green services such as termite, mosquito and lawn care. Northwest Green programs are continuing to grow with an increasing desire among homeowners for nonchemical treatment in pest control. Overall these programs are greatly contributing to Northwest's impressive growth rate as this brand has produced the highest growth of any Rollins' brands during the quarter. Gary previously noted our strong employer retention and I'm pleased to be able to say that we have continued our improvement in that important metric through the third quarter of this year. We talk about retention a lot in our businesses as we can't stress enough that for a service provider the importance to ensuring our employees remain happy and motivated in their jobs is paramount. A happy employee translates to a happy customer. We have largely focused our field team efforts in three ways to gain this improvement. First, we conduct exit surveys to focus on why people leave as well as concerted employee engagement assessment efforts to ensure our teams feels they have a voice in making things better, and last is the effort to improve the onboarding and orientation experience our people undergo. We know if we can just get them past the first year or so the likelihood to stay goes up exponentially. Our team members are the face of our brands and we will continue to invest in training programs, technology and provide opportunities for advancement to ensure they remain with us. Finally, for me, just a quick update on routing and scheduling. For the third quarter, we again had improvements in driving and route efficiency as we clock 571,000 less miles driven. This improved efficiency comes on the heels of a 1.4 million mile reduction in Q3 last year and we have now had 19 consecutive months of milage reductions. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thanks, John. Mother Nature returned with full strength in the third quarter and our operations, the support staff and sales groups were up for the challenge. Record revenues enabled strong improvements in our financial metrics across the board. Even with the ongoing business expenses, headwinds of employee benefits, foreign currency exchange and Clark integration items, we made tremendous improvements in all of our financial metrics for the quarter and are positioned well to end the year on a very strong note. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed exceptional growth and key to the quarter included : finalization of the Rollins' pension risk transfer; expansion of our Glympse communication to our residential customer base; and a return to margin growth year-over-year. Before we proceed with the review of our financial results, I hope that you've had a chance to review our press release from October 3 related to our pension risk transfer. If not it is posted on our website to view. Our overfunded status grew from our original estimate of 104% to nearly 111%. As noted in the press release, we will be using these cash proceeds to fund our company 401(k) match over the next several quarters and pay other plan-related expenses. Once these steps are completed, we will anticipate bringing $6 million to $8 million in cash back to the company for additional deployment. The accounting adjustment was also significantly lower than our original estimate, mainly driven by lower interest rates. This accounting pension adjustment flow through our P&L in Q3 and was approximately $50 million before tax. As you know, this is a one-time non-cash occurrence. As Gary said, I will be discussing our GAAP metrics and then spending time on our non-GAAP financial metrics that exclude the pension adjustment. For the quarter, we are only calling out the pension adjustment for our non-GAAP results. But a few other items to keep in mind with regards to our net income for the quarter related to our Clark acquisition are : depreciation of $1.4 million for the quarter for buildings and vehicles added; amortization of intangibles up $2.9 million per customer contracts; interest expense was $2.8 million related to the borrowing of Clark; professional services about $800,000 as Clark uses a large number of subcontractors and this is a higher percentage of revenue than in our other Rollins' brand. These categories equate to $7.9 million and as they subside or lapped, will continue to improve our year-over-year margin expansion moving forward. As we look through our numbers, I will give you GAAP numbers that include our pension accounting adjustment and then transition to our non-GAAP numbers that reflect our true operating results, again, only with the pension loss eliminated. So with the pension, looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenue was $556.5 million. That was an increase of 14.1% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $487.7 million. Again, with the pension adjustment included, income before income taxes was $46.1 million or 48.7% below 2018. Net income was $44.1 million, down 33.9% compared to 2018. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax rose 6.8% to $96 million compared to $89.9 million in 2018. We had a slightly higher tax rate this quarter at 26.5%, but feel that our full year rate will be in the low 20s with our Q3 pension entry. Our net income rose 6% to $70.6 million and EPS were $0.22 per diluted share up from $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018, a 10% increase. As I've mentioned on previous calls, our best financial measure at this time is EBITDA, which was $120.6 million compared to $106.7 million in 2018, a 13% increase. We have only had one other quarter outside of the quarter with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that eclipsed this growth since 2014. With the pension revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $1.509 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.377 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 20.9% to $189.2 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 15.6% to $152.6 million and earnings per share were $0.47, down 14.5% from the 2018 number of $0.55. EBITDA was $252.1 million, down 12.9% compared to 2018. Without the pension adjustment, income before income tax decreased 0.1% to $239 million from $239.3 million in 2018. Net income fell 0.1% to $179.2 million and earnings per share were $0.55 flat to the previous year. EBITDA was $302 million, up 4.3% compared to 2018. Our technology roadmap continues to pay healthy dividends with regards to operational efficiency improvements and an improved customer experience. John mentioned, the improvements in miles driven for the quarter as we continue to see improvements year-over-year since the inception of our routing and scheduling initiative, which started in 2016. These reductions increased the time our technicians can spend with the customers and increases the technician's capacity. As of September, we have added over 70% of our Orkin residential routes to Glympse. Each customer on these routes is receiving multiple proactive text or e-mail notifications from the technician beginning days in advance and culminating when they're on their way to the customer. This technology is the best in the industry, and our early results show improved customer retention for each of our mature branches that are providing this enhanced customer communication. We anticipate these results to continue to improve our customer retention and margin for quarters and years to come, much like we have seen from our routing and scheduling results. Let's take a look through the Rollins' revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase was 14.1% and included 7.7% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 6.4% was from pricing and organic growth. This is the strongest organic growth rate in a quarter since 2013. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 17.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 17% of our revenue, was up 15.4%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 6.4%. From that, residential was up 8%; commercial increased 3.5%; and termite and ancillary grew 7.9%. This was the largest commercial increase in over a year. The revenue strength this quarter is a combination of the late season that did not materialize in Q1 or Q2, execution by our operations and a great job by our sales force. One of Gary's famous quotes is \"The season always comes. At some point it does get warm and the pests do come out and the season does start.\" In most years, that strength is seen in May and June and impacts Q2. As you know that did not occur this year, but our year-to-date revenue growth, ex currency and M&A is moving in a direction to be in line or higher than the past three years. The key is that demand does not evaporate. When it gets warm, the bugs come out. This year that did not happen until July, but it did in a really big way. In total gross margin improved to 51.7% from 51.6% prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories such as service salaries, sales salaries, personnel-related and professional services, all related to the acquisition of Clark. These increases were offset by reductions in administrative salaries due to improved efficiency and reduction in materials and supplies. The additional Clark items that I just mentioned impacted the margin by almost a full percentage point. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $21.7 million, an increase of 28.6%. Depreciation increased $1.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.1 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $22.1 million or 15.2% to $167.2 million or 30% of revenues, up 0.3 percentage point from $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased sales competition, compensation, enhanced 401(k) plan expense, maintenance and IT contract expense. As for our cash position for the period ended September 30, 2019, we spent $431.2 million on acquisitions compared to $71.8 million for the same period last year which of course included Clark. We paid $103.1 million on dividends and had $18.7 million of CapEx which was up 4.8% from 2018, primarily from planned IT upgrades such as our BOSS Canada rollout and building improvements. We ended the period with $104.4 million in cash, of which $71 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.105 per share that will be paid on December 10, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 11, 2019. In addition, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.05 also payable when the regular dividend is paid. For the regular cash dividend this is the 12.5% increase over the prior year. This marks the 17th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12% and the seventh year in a row the Board has declared a special dividend. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. I want to focus on -- I know it's a smaller piece of your business only 17% in the quarter but I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your termite business this morning. Almost 8% organic growth, which is particularly impressive I think given that last year, that's on top of a 6.5% growth. So I mean your termite business is growing really well and kind of above what we've seen in some of your competitors. I was wondering if you could comment on that business and perhaps why you're seeing such strong performance there? Eddie Northen : Yes. Tim I would say a couple of different things. We've had good termite growth. I think if you look back probably over the last nine or 10 quarters maybe even a little bit further back than that we've had good consistent termite growth. You're right this quarter was enhanced a little bit more. A little bit of that would be a pent-up demand. But we've talked about on previous calls that we have our internal credits department that enabled us to really be able to help with the closing tool for that. So it's a great quality service from a termite perspective. And we also have that ability for our customers to be able to use our internal credit department. For some -- in some cases a larger dollar expense that they would have for that type of service. So operations continue to put a good quality product out there and I think the sales folks continue to use our sales tools extremely well to be able to close those sales. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Eddie. And as my follow-up, one of your competitors recently began talking about some increased claims expense that they're experiencing because of more aggressive behavior from the Formosan termite, ancillary, this was in a specific region. But I'm just curious if you guys are also seeing higher claims activity some thought maybe. If one company were seeing it maybe other companies would be seeing it too. I'm wondering if you're seeing increased pressure from higher claims activity as well. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yeah. I \u2013 Tim, I don't know the specifics of the other that you're talking about or we couldn't read some of the same things that you read publicly. I'll say perspective for termite, our termite claims are actually down year-over-year. Our dollars -- our litigated dollars are down and our claims dollars are down year-over-year. I think the thing that we have in place that really has been enabled us to continue to reduce this over many years is we have a very strong dedicated termite services group, technical services group that enable us to make sure that we have a good quality product that's out there. We have a QA group that will look on the backside to make sure that a good quality service is being done. And they'll also help to manage any claims related issues or concerns that might be out there to be able to help to minimize that in any way possible. We also take a look carefully at the contracts that we offer that are available out there kind of based on the different type of termite and the different areas of the country to make sure that we feel like it's the right risk to be able to take in the different areas. Gary Rollins : Yeah. And I would add to that that this termites -- dedicated termite quality insurance team that Eddie mentioned they are independent from our branch operations. So they go into every one of our branches on a regular basis to actually go out and inspect the work that they do and make sure that we are delivering what we promise. And so that's been a huge linchpin in terms of us reducing our termite damage claims both from a dollar perspective, paid perspective and a number perspective over the last say 20 years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Clement with Buckingham Research Group. Jamie Clement : Hey, guys. Gentlemen, good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Jamie Clement : Good morning. John I don't know if you want to take this or Gary, but just obviously M&A activity in your industry is what I think is probably on an unprecedented level right now. And it seems like a lot of smaller businesses are being bought by some of the bigger folks. It seems you all are interested in some quality smaller businesses as well. Can you talk a little bit about the challenges of by purchasing and integrating small businesses with respect to retention both at the technician level as well as the customer level? Gary Rollins : Yeah. Jamie, no doubt the market is frothy from that perspective in terms of the opportunity to buy these companies. And with the multiples being paid certainly many of the smaller companies are out there and actively shopping and trying to sell their companies as well. We certainly go after the small ones. Just like we do the bigger ones the -- they can provide a tremendous opportunity to tuck-in to a location and really improve that the densities, the route density of that branch and that business. And so that's usually the approach we'll take with those, but from an employee perspective we take the same approach as we do from -- with the bigger ones, because as I like to say our team in our business when you buy a company, you don't buy a lot of hard assets, all you get are employees and customers and neither has to stay. And so if we don't treat the employee well, and onboard them well and integrate them well then that customer won't be there at the end of the day either. And so that's really our approach whether it's big or small. Jamie Clement : Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : Hey, good morning everybody. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Eddie Northen : Good morning. Seth Weber : Just wondering if you could give us some more color, the 3.5% growth in commercial, you noted that was the best in more than a year. Is there anything you'd call out there? Any kind of special initiatives? Anything you've been targeting there? Can you talk about what you're seeing on the pricing front as well? That's my first question. Thank you. Eddie Northen : Yeah. I would say that, the pricing is a very rational in the industry. We know that there are other players that, if you look back three years, five years, seven years, they may not have been in the market. We're still seeing very rational pricing that is out there in most cases that are available. We really concentrated on areas where we know that, there's less price sensitivity. So, we really shifted our focus probably over the last 18 months from a new customer perspective really looking at those areas. There's lots of different groups that \u2013 companies that have their own margin pressure and that can be pushed along to all of their vendors. And we're continuing to move away from those and continue to concentrated areas, where there's less price sensitivity and they care more about the quality and they're willing to pay for the quality or the service. So we're seeing some more retention from that because the quality of service that we're able to attain and I think that's helping us to be able to continue to incrementally improve and in this case have a pretty healthy jump as far as the commercial is concerned. Seth Weber : Yeah. Looks great. John Wilson : Yeah. One thing I might add, we also implemented a new pay plan for our commercial sales, people that much more greatly incentivize them to pursue recurring revenue. We kind of got hooked on that bed bug revenue for a period of time. And while that's great to get, it's not recurring and as you guys know we really prefer that recurring revenue to build. And so we've sort of changed our focus and incenting our people to pursue this \u2013 these other higher quality customers that are recurring in nature as Eddie described. Gary Rollins : John, I'd like to add to that. We have developed a software that we call Insight. So, we have the ability to show commercial customer the layout of their facility and what we intend to do in those areas typically base stations and service emphasis on the high pest pressure areas. And we think that this is going to help distinguish what we can offer the customer. And so far we don't have it in \u2013 everywhere, but where we do have it we're showing good results. Seth Weber : And are you finding that customers are willing to pay \u2013 the contract size is bigger with that Insight \u2013 by using Insight, can you get higher contract values and things like that, or can you just expand on that a little bit? Gary Rollins : I think ultimately, we will. I mean, it distinguishes us and then we're able to identify where we've had a rodent activity. So this isn't just a sales tool, but it's also a means to have continuous communication with the customer. And this is especially important when you get into big commercial situations. And you might have 50 base stations in some of these larger warehouses and manufacturing operations. So I think one of the benefits will be not only from the sales point of view, but retention point of view because we're just reaffirming the fact that we are doing these service stops, if you will or check in the base stations. And it gives a customer a feel that this is not just a sale this is an ongoing communications tool. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Butler with Stifel. Brian Butler : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Brian Butler : Just the first one on kind of the growth trends you're seeing, can you give a little bit more color I guess on the organic trends maybe help us. If we pull out some of the seasonality across second quarter to third quarter, what kind of organic trends are you seeing? Is this \u2013 is this pace changed recently to improving? That'll be very helpful. Eddie Northen : I think it'd be extremely difficult to break it out exactly. We've talked about pent-up demand. Gary talks regularly about looking at a full year as far as revenue growth, because there is going to be fluctuation. It's going to occur between the different quarters. Of course, this year was tremendously different than anything that we've seen in previous years and I think Gary probably would say the same thing and in his time period it was completely different. But there was significant pent-up demand. But I would also say that, we had great marketing initiatives. And our operations executed extremely well, to be able to have a higher retention rate from a customer perspective, which I think will help us from an organic revenue perspective as we're moving forward in time. So, I think the combination of those things, helped with the record that we saw this quarter. And I think they're going to help us as we move forward. The technology that we put in place with Glympse and John talked about our routing and scheduling it's making it a better job for our technician. And it's making it a better customer experience, from a customer's perspective. And all those things are incrementally improving that customer retention piece, which ultimately will help us as we're continuing to grow our revenues. Brian Butler : Okay. And then, my follow-up question just on the margins. Just looking at the EBITDA margin, it looks like EBITDA margins ex the pension we're still down around 20 basis points. Can you give a little bit of color on kind of very strong revenue growth but some of that operating leverage seems to have been lost somewhere, and then, how to think about operating leverage going forward from here? Eddie Northen : Well I talked about that a little bit in my comments when I -- the only thing we called out in the adjusted was the pension adjustment. However, we do know that we had some onetime events having to do with the Clark integration, such as our D&A, our interest, professional expenses as well as our 401(k) increases. All of those contributed probably to a difference of a percentage point as far as the overall margin was concerned. So I think, if you go through and you -- if you wanted to look at it from that perspective you go through and kind of strip those things out. I think you'll see a nice improvement, year-over-year for the quarter. And, we believe that, as those areas subside and/or we lap those areas. We're going to continue to see that margin moving in a positive direction as we have for many quarters and many years before this. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm showing no questions in the queue. I would like to turn it back over to management, for closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Well. Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your interest. I hope you sense that we're optimistic about our company's opportunities going forward. We have a lot of investments that we think will start to payoff in a greater form. It's kind of hard to put it all together and come up with a cumulation of these investments and where they take us. But we see movement with all of them -- positive movement with all of them. And we've got some tremendous companies and brands. And we're very proud of what we've done. And we're very proud of the transition that these companies have gone through and have experienced. So, we look forward to giving you our update with our fourth quarter call. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Marilyn Meek. Ms. Meek, you may begin. Marilyn Meek : Thank you, Cassidy. By now you should have all received a copy of the press release. However, if anyone is missing a copy and would like to receive one, please contact our office at 212-827-3746 and we will send you a release and make sure you are on the Company's distribution list.

On the line with me today and presenting are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer; and Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks and then we will open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin. Gary Rollins : Yes, Marilyn, thank you, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we will begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 13.8% to $506 million compared to $444.6 million for the same quarter in 2018. Net income was approximately $50.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues for the full-year increased 10.6% to $2.015 billion compared to $1.822 billion for 2018. We are all pleased that we broke the $2 billion milestone. Net income for the full-year was $203.3 million with earnings per share of $0.62. This compared to net income of $231.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share last year. Net income this year was negatively impacted by $50 million one-time charge for closing down our pension plan and a casualty reserve increase. Eddie will address these charges further in a few minutes. We continue to experience good solid growth in all of our business lines for the quarter, with residential up 16.5%, commercial, excluding fumigation, rose 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services grew 16.1%.  During the fourth quarter a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what is your exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of treating and protecting structures of termite infestations and damage. As background, Chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years. Among its numerous uses, Chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, Chlordane use was narrowed to only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of Chlordane in the United States were canceled. Orkin had stopped treating for Chlordane with - a year before. It is noteworthy that, prior to this action, our Company negotiated an agreement between the Velsicol Chemical Company, the manufacturer and the EPA, where Velsicol to voluntarily stop manufacturing Chlordane and that it not be banned, they both agreed. This helped Orkin and the industry to avoid a potential law suit stampede like the asbestos situation. In the mid-'90s, the state of the post-Chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals didn't work as well as Chlordane. However, the new termiticide that had been so positively promoted by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA failed miserably. This failure happened within a very short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies' customers' homes with a vengeance. Orkin, which at one time led the industry with its lifetime repair guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations. In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new product targeting all the homes that had previously been treated with the ineffective termite product. Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occurred, and provide our customers the protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than a $100 million. Our lifetime guarantees will replace the three to five retreatment guarantees depending on the area of country and the type of home construction. Our 1996 P&L resulted - reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The decrease in termite revenues, termite claims, and retreatment expense negatively impact our financial results. Incidentally, we are all proud to work for a Company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand, and reputation. 1997, the following year, we set up a $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur.  While the short-term costs were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning point always caused us - also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the utilization of flow meters to measure the volume of termiticide applied, and the use of foam as a chemical carrying agent in difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school to service technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed. We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments.  All of these actions still exist today. I could go on and on with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite reserve and other related costs tremendously. I will now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work as well as Chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the three years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied in dramatic fashion. By 1997 and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20 million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training, and treatment protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry icon Paul Hardy, and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus on meeting all obligations to their customers. The Companywide quality assurance program Orkin put into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us to get out in front of this accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent headlines, as they were already a growing concern. In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both a financial and human capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run. In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions in termite damage claims.  The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins experienced historically low termite claim volumes and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full-year. This is the direct result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns around termite damage claims and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our experience better. So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know, we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week-long regional manager leadership meeting in Atlanta.  We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience, etc. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learned lessons are the hardest. And after this last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized, that our teams were ready and up to the challenge, and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them. Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thanks, John. Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After mother nature deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth, and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention.  Specifically, our Orkin employee retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all three service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experienced management matters. I also hope that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry. For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were, rising accident and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by a $0.01, depreciation increase related to the final stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada, and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full-year numbers, my focus today will be to share the non-operational event that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to accidents and injuries. Lastly, I will give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a great start. First, I will go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million, was an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income taxes was $72 million or 0.008% above 2018.  Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.004% compared to 2018 and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5% compared to 2018. When looking at the full-year 2019 numbers, keep in mind that the almost $50 million pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of the Rollins books. For the year, we are calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense, and currency for our non-GAAP results. For the full-year, revenue was $2.015 billion, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7 million in 2018. Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018 numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018. Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.001% to $311.1 million compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.008% to $229.9 million and earnings per share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%. Our Companywide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially higher premium rates experienced within the industry caused our casualty reserve for accidents and injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly a $0.01. As John shared with you earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have enhanced safety features and when coupled with our enhanced training, will result in better injury and accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins and we will see the benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters. As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to the next step in our journey. First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system or CRM called BOSS. And in stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200 basis points to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes.  And as you probably know, we exceeded that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction, which will equate to margin improvement of another 150 basis points to 250 basis points over the next two to three years. This step is phase two of a robust four phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 5.7% was from pricing and organic growth.  In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 16.5%, commercial pest control, ex-fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue was up 9.8%, and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 3.6%, and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%. There are two items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over 30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our one-time bed bug business and helped our residential product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past six years. In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries, and personnel-related for our 401-K match. Additionally, insurance and claims were up substantially as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to 50.6% in 2019, compared to 50.2% in 2018. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million, due to the amortization of customer contracts from several large acquisitions. Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey as discussed earlier. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8 million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.001% from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend for Clark that was not in our 2018 number. Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an average of around $20 million over the past five years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we will also see some residual improvements from our pension transition. As for our cash position, for the period ended December 31, 2019 we spent $430.6 million on acquisitions compared to $76.8 million at the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We ended the period with $94.3 million in cash, of which $74.1 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2020. The cash dividend is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. Gary, I will turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, thanks for the time. So, I think, I just wanted to get a sense for what the current multiples you're seeing in the M&A market. I mean, I think, a larger competitor of yours is not going to be doing deals for a, while and - or at least they are going to be less aggressive on what they are going to be paying. I just wanted to see if that is impacting your planning for 2020. And, if multiples do remain off peak in 2020, should we expect another outsized year? Maybe not a year as large as 2019, but could 2020 be another above-average type of year? Gary Rollins : Yeah. So, Mario, I will just say that, yeah, I mean, there is no question that within the industry - that several within the industry have paid above historic rates. We did have the largest acquisition in our Company's history, which obviously from a multiple perspective was a little bit higher than what we paid historically, but we have not deviated from the average acquisition that we have. We have not deviated from our normal history, which has been somewhere between 1.25 times and 1.75 times annual revenue. And it really comes down to the selection of that seller and then making the decision of what it is that they are trying to accomplish. If that seller is just trying to get the largest dollar that they can out there, there are competitors in the market that, as you stated, have paid higher multiples. We have been very diligent with that and I think We have made some great selection. And, John is really more involved in that on a day-to-day basis and I don't know if you have something else - you would like to add to that. John Wilson : No, I don't know that I have much, but I would say, 2019 would be really rather hard to top. And I can only think that they will go down from there. I don't know, it is anybody's guess as to how much, but we want to maintain discipline in our approach, and - but then be willing to go a little extra mile when it is a really solid Company. Mario Cortellacci : Great. And then, just a quick question on your connected technology and just wondering if you can give us a sense of how many of your customers are using technology, or how many locations connected technology is already at? And, I guess, where that fits into your technology road map overall? I just didn't know how big or how fast you wanted that to be longer term. Eddie Northen : We have been testing connected technology for several years now. We have our technology, our IT group as well as our technical support group, are constantly testing all the technology and of course, as I'm sure you can assume, it is changing rapidly. We have test customers that are using different products.  At this point in time, we are not in a position to make any sort of material change to what we are doing today. We feel very prepared that if and when there is an industry shift or change or a customer need, we are ready to be able to respond to that. But I think, at this point in time, we are just continuing doing what we are doing from a service perspective and we would supplement it, as appropriate from there. Gary Rollins : Eddie, I would like to add. One advantage I think that we have is that several of our brands are using different software. So, we are really in a position to monitor the successes and the features that exist and, of course, as always, to use the best product. We will be converting BOSS and Western next year. At this point, it is certainly the superior of everything that is out there, but I think it is worthwhile that we can watch carefully when other products are available. Eddie Northen : And, every time - and to add to that, every time we do that, it gives us the ability to be able to link in any connected technology in a more efficient manner, but I think we have some really smart people on our team that are looking at this, both from the technology and the technical support side and I feel very confident where we are at this point. Mario Cortellacci : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Clement of Buckingham Research. Jamie Clement : Hey, guys, although it is early in earnings season, it seems like some of the industries out there that advertise heavily and I have got sort of restaurant chains in mind, have discussed with investors on their calls that with elections in front of us that there might be a little bit of margin pressure from increasing in - increase in advertising and marketing costs. I don't recall that being called out as much four years ago. Is that something that you have your eyes on or did it impact you four years ago or can you just tweak your mix and really have it not be that much of an issue? Eddie Northen : Kevin Smith is our CMO and he has been up against this hurdle, not specifically the one you're talking about with the election, but he has been up against this hurdle with potential for rising costs in this area for the last several years. Digital marketing - we shifted to digital marketing tremendously over the last six years. And as everyone knows, the cost in those areas continue to escalate. But Kevin's budget for advertising has not changed over that time period as far as a percent to revenue. So he and his team have done a tremendous job just figuring out how do we still create the number of leads that we need by the different service lines, using the different opportunities that are out there. Some of that is going to be things like advertising on billboards, some of it is going to be commercial advertising, some of it is going to be through digital, but he uses that total bucket and goes through and figures out a way to be able to create that demand that we need in order to be able to grow our business. And I don't see this 2020 year being any different for the results that you will be able to go through and create. Jamie Clement : Okay, great, Eddie, and just one final thing. The strong termite numbers that you reported for the quarter and obviously they have been very good for the last couple of years. During the quarter and kind of bigger picture, looking back over the last year or two, has there been a disproportionate level of growth internationally in your termite reported segment versus domestically or are they both pretty consistent? And, I'm just thinking about climate differences in places like Australia and that kind of thing. Eddie Northen : Yeah, we don't break things out by geographic areas, but I will just say, in general, We have not seen any sort of specific area that is been tremendously different. We have - our folks have done a great job growing this product across all of our markets. Within the U.S., We have done a tremendous job using our closing tools that we have, our in-house financing has been a big push and a big piece of that, our sales folks have done a tremendous job. And, we camped out on this for a while with Gary and John talking about the quality of the service. And people talk and when the quality of the service is what it is and we have great outcomes, then we get an opportunity to have word of mouth and we get a chance to continue to cross sell, knowing we had the largest residential set of customers that are out there. We get a chance to cross sell our pest control or our termite into our pest control customers. Jamie Clement : Thank you all very much for your time as always. Eddie Northen : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Gary, thank you for the great history lesson on the termite business. That was very informative. And, John, for the termite damage claims, you said claims expenses were below 1% of revenue for the full-year. Is that 1% of total revenue or 1% of termite revenue? John Wilson : No, it is 1% of termite revenue. Tim Mulrooney : All right. I just wanted to make sure. That is what I thought, but I wanted to make sure. And, John, while I got you, can you also just talk about what you plan to do differently this year to prepare for the spring pest season? What were the primary takeaways from your recent meeting with business leaders or at least one that you can share with us publicly? John Wilson : Yeah, I think the single biggest thing would be to delay our stub staffing for the seasonality of our business to more of a just-in-time approach. That is a tricky tightrope to walk in a tough labor market, but that is what our field operators are really focused on doing this year. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Butler of Stifel. Brian Butler : Okay, great. I was hoping, could you give a little bit of color on maybe on organic growth heading into 2020? I mean, it was strong in the back half of 2019. Is that pace sustainable or is there some things out there that could put some pressure on that? Eddie Northen : We don't know of anything right now that would put pressure on it. I mean, it is early in the year to be celebrating. January has been a much better month than it was a year ago. But you know, but you never know what mother nature is going to do as we move forward in time. You never know what storms might look like. In 2017, we had two back-to-back storms, the two largest storms in our country's history, that negatively impacted things. So there are lot of variables that will come into play, but given everything that we know today, we believe that we are off to a good start and we have no reason to believe that we won't have a really good year from an organic growth perspective. With the growth of our mosquito product now for the third year, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, we continue to see great opportunity with that particular product as a cross-sell opportunity. We talked about our termite being able to grow as far as a cross-sell opportunity, We have been able to do that. So I think there are lot of very positive things that are going on. Pricing is still very rational and we are able to see price increase. So we feel very good about 2020 from an organic growth perspective. Gary Rollins : And I think it is important to share that this was the most disappointing year We have had for 22 years. So we think that it was an anomaly. I have never seen so many one-time charges in my experience, Eddie. Eddie Northen : Noticed that. Gary Rollins : And, but seriously, I mean, We have learned from this past year, I think John hit it on the head. I think we got too ambitious, too soon. You can't make the season and we had some disappointments due to mother nature. But I'm a believer of taking our mistakes and learning from them and benefiting from them. And we had a very powerful leaders conference. Our people are optimistic. And with the technology that we are enlisting, we think we are going to have a good year. Brian Butler : Okay, that is very helpful. And then one last one. On the cost, you had pointed out a higher cost around Clark in the service salaries, is that limited to 2019? Or should we think about those costs really kind of continuing forward into 2020? Eddie Northen : Well, the purchase was closed May 1. So by May 1, we will be lapping at that point in time, but it will be new until then. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : Just to follow -- just following up on that last question. Just to make sure I'm understanding this, the insurance claims issue, does that continue to be an overhang in next year or is this kind of - do you feel like you have isolated it here in the fourth quarter? Does that become - until you install the new technology on the new vehicles, a better training and whatnot, do you expect to see this elevated level into next year? And sorry for the clarification. Eddie Northen : Appreciate you asking that question. We do not continue to see an issue as we move forward. We believe that this was a little bit of an anomaly from the two items that I pointed out. The industry for the first time in several years, insurance rates increased dramatically. Some commercial groups would have strong double-digits, that they would talk about. Our increase in our casualty in total was about 5%. And I think a piece of that was managing our automotive claims year-over-year. But we feel as though, with the enhancements that we are going to have from a technology perspective, with the vehicles, as well as the continued training that we will see positive results that come from that. When you take a look at our total claims in the automotive side, again those are down. So we know that that will pay dividends as we move forward in time. Seth Weber : Okay. And is it possible to displace out how much that impacted gross margin in the quarter on the just the insurance portion of that? Eddie Northen : I don't know that number off the top of my head. I'm sure that we have that in our breakout, but I don't know that number off the top of my head. Seth Weber : Okay. And just on the... Eddie Northen : It was worth a $0.01 to us in total for our earnings. So you can... Seth Weber : Right. Eddie Northen : You could get kind of a rough idea from that perspective. Seth Weber : Okay. And then just, when you talked about the expected, I think it was 150 basis points to 200 basis points of additional margin improvement over the next several years from some of the new initiatives and things. I guess is that off of a kind of the current level? Is that off of the pre-Clark margin? I'm just, I just want to make sure I understand what the baseline is for that compare. Thanks. Eddie Northen : Well, once Clark lapse, we will have less of a negative comparison from that. So you could really look at it from the pre-Clark levels and say this is going to enhance our overall operations as we are moving forward by the 150 basis points to 250 basis points. Seth Weber : Okay. And, sorry, what was the timing on that? Eddie Northen : Next two to three years. Seth Weber : Two to three. Okay. That is all I had. Thank you very much. Eddie Northen : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Hey, thank you for taking my follow-up question. Eddie, I saw that you guys used cash to pay down debt a little bit more in the fourth quarter. Can you remind me what your capital allocation plans are for 2020 with respect to debt pay down? I am trying to get a handle on how much cash you would have left over after that for M&A and dividends? Eddie Northen : Well, that is our number one priority and it is - the fact that we have some debt right now will not keep us out of the market, if the right opportunity comes and the right valuation. But we will keep that as our number one priority to find and acquire good quality pest control companies. If they come about, then we will continue to use our cash to be able to move forward with that. Number two priority, we just announced that we were able to increase our dividend, and then from there we will pay down our debt. So if there are good quality opportunities that come to market and it makes sense to us, we are going to continue to move forward just like we have over the last several years. If that were to slow down some, then we will be a little bit more aggressive paying that debt down. So that is kind of where we stand with that. Tim Mulrooney : Got you. Thanks for the clarification. Eddie Northen : Yeah, absolutely. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are very optimistic about our Company's opportunities going forward. And appreciate your interest in our Company. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter call. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

On the line with me today and presenting are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer; and Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes, Marilyn. Thank you and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2020 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Eddie Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2019 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008 as the closest example that we've had. But from my perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifaceted, found ourselves in unchartered waters. Prior to the last two weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shutdown early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest hit state, New York, and other states shutdown randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final two weeks to adjust for the revenue drop. Revenues for the first quarter though grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year. On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, residential up 18.6%, commercial pest control rose 8%, and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%. Couple of other bright spots during the quarter, mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw record-setting growth in that business line. We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double-digits over last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly. You're entering what is traditionally the high pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive and with termite, it's too early to judge the season. Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality, retail, restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in healthcare, food processing, logistics and grocery. The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We're pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress a number of serious pathogens that could endanger their employees and customers. The VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service. Our company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of a pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This will be across the nation as regions, states, counties, and cities begin to open up. The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly. Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibilities seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the public's well-being is an important assignment. I'll now turn the call over to John for more details. John Wilson : Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees, and customers. Our people on the front-lines of this pandemic have performed heroically taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines. Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly. Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers, and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing. The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front-line. To help ensure this, we have provided a companywide increase to our paid time-off program for all full and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or has been quarantined for suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need while protecting their health and the safety of those around them. Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves, and in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected. Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Front-line team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken. As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free. Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademarked as VitalClean uses an EPA registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or lists and that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous surfaces. We are very excited about the potential for this service for both our existing and potential customers. And now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insights as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insights to what we know today. Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers, as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together. As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers. As Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue, and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment or PPE for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups at the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included higher material costs and supplies as mentioned with the personal protective equipment, the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service Orkin VitalClean and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2. Looking any of the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million, an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million, or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lock Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes depreciation of $1.4 million mostly due to buildings and added vehicles, amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million, and interest expense of $2.4 million. As we've mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These two items along with the transition to new more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year. Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue was up 8%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double-digits. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial ex-fumigation increased 2.1%, and termite and ancillary grew 11%. There are two items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past six years. In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. But moving the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million, or 32.4% of revenues, down one-tenth of a percentage point from $139.5 million, or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease as the percent of revenue and the percent of revenue was primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects. Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus, and this step along with the others that we have taken will further prepare us to come out of this time and even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter. As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions, compared to $7 million at the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The two other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll, and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue. Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Cost of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters. Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent to revenue by about one tenth of a percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean with early winds around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada. As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pest services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well-positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed. Finally, the Board of Directors approved the temporary reduction through our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 11th, 2020. Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you. Hi, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. Just -- I think the most important thing for investors to derive in what the exit rates were at the end of March. And just wondering if you can give us more color and then if you can quantify what you saw organic growth for resi and commercial at the end of March and then how that's trended throughout April? Do you think that we've bottomed at this point? And just what do you see, I guess, where you can expect possibly the rest of the quarter? Obviously we don't know, but just based out of April trends? Gary Rollins : Yes. Mario, I hate to punt on the first question out. That's really difficult. We have -- on the residential side, which we put in our press release, we're still seeing good demand. On the commercial side, we know what customers have been impacted on the commercial side. We've suspended some customers or they suspended us because of not having a need. And the reason why I'm pumping on the question is because we don't know of those ones that have suspended. We don't know which ones of those customers will be coming back. We have a feeling for the larger customers which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about those mom and pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situation. So, it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well. But residential, we're definitely seeing the most positive, and we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like. Mario Cortellacci : Okay. And then, even during, say, the exit in March, you can share any color on that? Gary Rollins : Well, you look at the end of March and then you look at what that flowed into April. So, by the end of March, New York was shutdown, California was shutdown, a few other major states were shut down, but then you had other states that were beginning that shutdown process or shutdown portions of what they had going on. So, I just don't think that it's going to be fair for us to be able to even share that because I don't really know what that's going to look like. I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have a bowling alleys open, but we also have restaurants -- we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here and I said, okay, how many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since we've opened back up, and no one raised their hand. So, we just don't really know what the impact is going to be even as we're opening back up and what the impact is going to be longer term for these businesses to be able to stay in business. Mario Cortellacci : Got you. Okay. And then just one more and I'll turn it over. On the disinfectant business, actually it's a very interesting idea, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of share some of the success that you might have seen, I think -- I've heard that you think the more success in Europe versus the U.S. in the early on days and probably with COVID hit over there versus the U.S. earlier. But what do you think that business looks like longer-term? I mean, just as people tend to have a very short memory, I mean, does this business accelerate in a year from now or do you think because people tend to be short-minded that maybe they forget about the COVID situation and they tell, I don't need this service anymore, and then maybe doesn't gain as much traction or have as much relevance maybe a year or two for now, just what your take on that? Gary Rollins : Well, before 9/11, we could always walk through an airport and we could just go get on a plane. And then after 9/11, that changed for all of us, forever probably. And I don't think we know exactly what the outcome of this will be at this point in time. I think in the near-term, I think all of the things we've seen from the different states that are opening up have some form of a recommendation of the cleanliness. And so, we're trying to go through and talk about what makes sense for the verticals, where to spend our time from a sales perspective with that. Some are going to need that just to be able to get customer back in the door and feel comfortable. Now, what I think the question that we don't know is, what's going to be mandated as we move forward in time as far as cleanliness. John Wilson : Yes. This is John Wilson, by the way, if I may add. I think Eddie hit the nail in the head with the mandated portion. I think there'll be certain industries, maybe hospitals, healthcare, food processing that it may well be mandated, some others that it's strongly recommended by the various government entities, health department, maybe most especially. So, it's hard to say, but I do think it can be fairly significant for us where the early returns is terrific in terms of what our people are managing to add to their customers with. Mario Cortellacci : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, everybody. Gary Rollins : Good morning, Tim. Eddie Northen : Good morning, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Can you shed some light on your end market exposure in the commercial parts business? I understand you don't want to give any insight into the growth rates through April, but what would help me and others maybe model because we have to model something, right? Specifically, I'm curious what percent of your commercial business is restaurants and hotels, which are likely under significant pressure right now? Eddie Northen : Yes, we've never broken that out. We're not going to break that out by vertical, and a lot of that's just going to be from a competitive standpoint. We don't want to put ourselves in the crosshairs of other competitors being able to step into the areas, but we have a good strong cross-section of all the different verticals. And if you'll go back to previous calls that we've had having to do with this topic, we've talked a lot about moving into the verticals such as -- or moving more strongly into verticals such as healthcare, such as food processing, such as logistics, and we've talked about that over the past couple of years. So, we've had a strong concentration in those areas. But there's no question that we have a very strong cross-section of all those different ones as well as a decent amount of large customers with a large performance of small and medium-sized customers as well. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, Eddie. Okay. That -- I understand. You don't want to disclose that for competitive reasons. Any vertical, I'm just trying to get something that can help us if any vertical more than 25% of your commercial business or can you tell us that no vertical is more than X percent of your business?  Any color that way where you're not really disclosing much of anything for competitive reasons but gives investors assurance that you're not over-weighted in any particular end market? Eddie Northen : I think your last statement is spot on. We were not over-weighted in any individual vertical that is out there. We have a relatively diversified set of verticals and have percentages in those relatively diversified as well. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Because I read an article recently from specialty consultants, which does market sizing. I think in there, it said something like 40% of the commercial business is restaurants. So, it's fair to say that your end market mix does not necessarily match that of the broader market? Gary Rollins : Your statement is correct. And I would -- I would be interested to understand the data behind what you read there. That's what I understand about, about what's out there in the industry. But your statements correct. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, cool. Thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue. Gary Rollins : Okay. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Seth Weber : Hi. Good morning. Hope everybody's well. I guess maybe a question for Eddie. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the collection side? Are you seeing customers delay payments? Are you doing anything to kind of ensure just the quality of your receivables or anything like that? And then I just had a follow-up on the M&A comment. Thanks. Eddie Northen : Yes. So we shored up our reserves a little bit on that side, just to make sure, we do have a pretty healthy diversified customer base as well, we really concentrated on higher income to be able to not only sell a product that sell more than one product. And we're seeing that band -- or income band of customers not being as impacted from a collection standpoint. So I think it's still a little bit too early to be able to say one way or another on that, you know, we're just three or four weeks into the unemployment checks and people still having, you know, relatively, relatively full income. But we're being a little bit cautious with that and we're being a little bit aggressive, putting more resources into that area, just to do the best that we can at this point. Seth Weber : Okay. Thanks. And then just going back to your comment on -- Eddie Northen : Just one more thing, just one more thing with that, you may or may not know, there are certain states that have put mandates in place where you are not allowed to collect, and those there. Seth Weber : Right. Eddie Northen : So you probably already know about all those and we're complying as we should for all of those states. Seth Weber : Okay. Thank you. And then just following up on your, your M&A comment, can you just characterize and valuation started to come down across the group here, over the last couple months relative to where they were? Eddie Northen : I would say the number of sellers are much less than what we've seen in previous times. And I would say that valuations for those that are still in the market are probably coming down as well, with other with less other players in the market. Some of our direct competitors have said publicly that they are not in the market. And, you know, while we're not necessarily aggressively going out there and looking we're absolutely being, open and opportunistic. Gary Rollins : Yes, I would agree with all of those statements. I do see valuations maybe coming down a bit, because just simply -- because there aren't as many buyers in the market at least right now. Seth Weber : Okay. It's very interesting. Thank you. Thank you guys, appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi. Thank you all for taking the questions and I'm glad everybody is safe and you all have done the right thing by your employees. Can I ask a clarification question first, if I may? I'm scribbling the numbers down as fast as I could when you're talking, but when you said $18 million to $22 million cost containment, is that an annualized number or that's the quarter savings? Eddie Northen : That's for the quarter. That's for the quarter. And that's going to include some of the categories that John talked about having to do with payroll. We really didn't go into a lot of the details on the discretionary cuts that we've made, but that would include those two categories, discretionary and payroll. Michael Hoffman : So, just so I'm clear. If I took the high end of materials and furloughs, and PTO, I mean, that's kind of $4 million, so I got $4 million headwind and I got an $18 million offset. Gary Rollins : If that's just the math -- yes. I don't have that -- that's transcribed. Michael Hoffman : Okay, good. All right then. I just want to make sure I understood right. My question-question -- it's two parts, trying to stay in the spirit of one question. Residential lead generation is okay, and when this lead starts, do you think you would get calls from commercial, let's say, hey, I'm going to restart, come in and do a -- I'll call it an added service, so there's a restart service kind of activity? Gary Rollins : Yes. I'm sure John can weigh in with a lot more specifics to that, but I'll just start by saying. I think we see customers in a few different buckets. One is, they're doing normal -- their normal service that they would have, either because they are fully in business or they're in some sort of partial business. I think we have another bucket that it completely stops at this point in time, because they don't have anything at all going on. And I think we have a third bucket, which is kind of a hybrid which let's just say they maybe received a service once a week, they might now be receiving a service every other week or every three weeks just to keep things relatively intact at this point. So, we've got -- by customer, we're trying to accommodate as best as makes sense for them, especially for those that know they're going to be opening up relatively soon, they don't want to make a decision that they're going to open up on, let's just say, May 1st, they haven't done anything for four weeks and now they have an infestation that they have to go through and deal with. They don't want to have that situation. So, I think those are kind of the buckets of what we're seeing by the customers. John Wilson : And Michael, we've seen a wide array of tactics by our customers to maybe defray costs. Some have chosen to suspend altogether, some have chosen to reduce frequency, and some have continued with their service even though they may be shut down knowing that they don't want an outbreak of pest problem. We've had one of our big retailers that had put us on suspend that's already notified us for to re-begin or begin service in May. So, I would suspect that we will have quite a few that as we're coming back on, we'll get us in there before they open. Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I thought, given a little pop from that and then back on to a normal trend. John Wilson : That makes sense. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks. John Wilson : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Marilyn Meek : Okay. No other questions? Gary Rollins : Okay. No other question. I'd like to add a comment, and that's -- we were so uncomfortable with these we don't know answers as I'm sure you all are hearing them. But I think that we have responded quickly. I think that we have three wonderful areas of increasing our business with our termite season, our mosquito season, and with the VitalClean. So -- and again, it is challenging to try to determine how big can VitalClean be. The first 30 days have been very encouraging, and our residential pest control leads have continued to be strong. So, you have so many variables, it's just really difficult to gauge all these, but I think one of the reasons that we took status with our dividend was that we just want to be prepared for the future. And those of you that have followed the company for some time know that we're generally conservative, and I think that we're in a best position of anybody in the industry to deal with this. So, we're just going to keep working at it and improving, and hopefully we'll see this turn in the near future. Saying that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us, we appreciate your interest in our company. On our behalf, we hope that you and your family and friends remain safe and well, and we look forward to updating you on our second quarter call. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

However, if anyone is missing a copy and would like to receive one, please contact our office at 212-827-3746, and we will send you a release and make sure you are on the company's distribution list. There will be a replay of the call, which will begin 1 hour after the call and run for 1 week. The replay can be accessed by dialing 1-844-512-2921 with a pass code 13705813. Additionally, the call is being webcast at www.viavid.com, and a replay will be available for 90 days. On the line with me today and presenting are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer; and Eddie Northen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes, Marilynn. Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2020 conference Call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Paul Northen : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Before talking about our results, I want to express how concerned and focused we are regarding the spread of COVID-19. We know many of you are experiencing the expansion of the virus in your communities, and we hope you and your family are doing well and remain safe. Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 17.2% to $75.4 million or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase. Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers. During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely. Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates. Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary, and good morning. I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do. As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first- responder locations : police stations, firehouses and hospitals. As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity. Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced. Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas. In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses. I will now turn the call over to Eddie. Paul Northen : Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt. Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter. The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019. As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights. In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic. Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Timothy Mulrooney : Congrats on a nice quarter in these difficult times. Paul Northen : Thank you, for that. Timothy Mulrooney : Given how much is going on lately, I have plenty of questions about the quarter, but something else came up recently that I wanted to get your perspective on. So here it goes. A major lawn care provider recently announced that they're getting into the residential exterior pest services. Given how well residential pest has held up during the pandemic, are you seeing that more often other service providers encroaching into the pest control space? Do you view this as a competitive threat? Are you not concerned? Any thoughts you have on this issue would be greatly appreciated. Paul Northen : Yes. So I guess what I would say is that we've seen through the years, and Gary can share his 50-plus years of what he's seen getting in and out of this space over time, residential continues to grow at a very hefty rate. But at the same time, it's a very fragmented market, as you know. We have a very healthy market share and other large players also have a very healthy market share. But there are a lot of other regional and mom-and-pop players that are part of this market as well. I know John has had some interaction with different companies as well. So John, I don't know if you want to share something and maybe Gary share what you've seen in the past. John Wilson : Yes, sure. Thank you, Eddie. Tim, we've seen sort of an evolution with TruGreen as their noncompete with Terminix has sort of expired, go from lawn to offering tick-and-flea services to mosquito to now what their offering is, is essentially outdoor residential pest control, outdoor only. And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services. So while it certainly bears watching, it's a tough sled. So we'll see what they do. Gary Rollins : Many of you may know that we were like the number three lawn care company in the country. And we had the decision kind of moving in the other way. Just felt like the lawn care business would be under more scrutiny, the fact that more regulatory pressures were existing. And we just didn't see the growth pattern and margin pattern equaling pest control. So what we did is when we got out of the business, we just ramped up our acquisitions and ramped up the speed in our revenue. It's going to be a challenge for them to do. Well, they say nothing's hard for the guy that doesn't have to do it. That may apply to us, Eddie, but we welcome them. Anytime a competitor comes in that has big prices, it just makes our job easier. Timothy Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you for that perspective, everybody. That's very helpful. As my follow-up, I'll ask one question about commercial pest. Gary, you mentioned something that I thought was interesting. You said you're narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Is another way for me to interpret that is to say, as you move through the quarter, the declines became smaller each month? So April was down the most, May was down less, June was down less, and July is down even less than June. Am I reading that right? Paul Northen : Tim, I'll start, and I'll let Gary share, obviously, what he wants to say. But I mean, we're really going to be the mirror of the economy in general. So I think in March going into early April is when the majority of the economy was completely shut down. And I think as you saw pockets begin to open up and you began to see commerce and hiring began and some of the stimulus checks get into people's hands, I think that made people make different decisions on things. And I think you've kind of seen the ebb and flow, of course, of that as some things are starting to kind of tighten up again. But I think incrementally, as things got a little bit better and a little better, we saw that on the commercial side as well. Do you want to say anything else on that? Gary Rollins : Yes, I would. Just for a minute. We -- as I said before, we've been in the business. We think that there's different growth patterns in lawn care than in pest control. But we -- what we're seeing is more of our commercial accounts, especially in the food-related industries realize that they can't defer their pest control indefinitely. And that's one of the motivations of them coming back. Because they've had an experience typically of large infestations and that's one of the things. They cannot do without pest control indefinitely. And they've got health department attention naturally. And so we really think that -- we see them coming back, but we think they'll continue to come back. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Emily McLaughlin : This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth this morning. My first question is on the margins. They were clearly very strong this quarter. Can you frame for us how much that reflected the temporary cost actions? And what will come back with volumes as they improve? And I know you called out routing and scheduling enhancements as a benefit. Any way to quantify that? Paul Northen : I would say a couple of things. One, if this event had to occur -- if the virus had to occur, the pandemic had to occur, from a business standpoint, it was the best possible time for us as an organization. We had not hired for our peak season. We were just starting into that at that point in time. So it enabled us to really be able to go through and quickly align the payroll side as best we could. And then John and team as well as here in our home office, we made some difficult decisions and made some cuts to be able to go through and be prepared. So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint. And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we're appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that we'll be -- that we'll have a clear focus on. And John and team across all the brands have done that. And of course, the commercial operations have been the most impacted, our brands that are predominantly commercial. But we have a lot of brands that have both residential and commercial, in a lot of cases, termite. John Wilson : Emily, if I may add. We got a pretty good indicator over the last 2 weeks of March that our commercial business is going to be most heavily impacted and -- whereas residential in our termite business was going to remain strong. So our people were able to laser in on the commercial side of that business and then -- and react very, very quickly. And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintained them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play. Emily McLaughlin : Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on VitalClean. I know it's still early days, but is there any way to think about the revenue and the margin contribution in the quarter? And what the take rate of that offering is with the clients that are reopening? And if it's helping you win new customers? Paul Northen : So we're not going to break that out. We don't break any other pieces out like that. I'll say that what we are seeing -- we're pleased with the growth that we've seen in a short period of time. What we're seeing is a couple of different things. One, if customers have some sort of incident at their locations, they're typically much more open to quickly move forward and get that in place. And then as other places are fully ramping up, so restaurants instead of being takeout and delivery now having seat -- inside seating. Those are the types of places where we've seen much more of a need. And as the economy continues to move in that direction, I think we'll see good opportunities. But it's been a great cross-sell for us. John and team, again, hats off. We're able to get the product launched, to get the salespeople trained, to get technicians fully trained and for our procurement group to get the product into the hands of our folks in a very short period of time has been very positive. So it's another trust point for our customers that we allow them to be able to run their business by us supporting them and it just takes one more worry off of their plate, having to deal with this whole situation. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : I wanted to drill a little further into the commercial business. And just, I guess, what you're seeing from commercial customers right now? Have you seen any bankruptcies from that business that could potentially impair a part of it? Obviously, I know you have the disinfectant business that is going to offset some of the lost revenue there, and hopefully the commercial comes back. But I just wanted to see, I guess, what do you expect longer term? Is there going to be a partial impairment of the commercial business longer term? And obviously, you'll gain some new commercial customers as the economy rebound, but would love to get your thoughts there. Paul Northen : Well, I don't think anybody has the full crystal ball on exactly what the economy is going to look like for Q3, Q4 moving into next year. I think there's no question that there will be bankruptcies that will come out of this. We've seen some of those already. We have the same headlines that you have, having to do with major franchise groups that have gone bankrupt, restaurant chains, some retail stores and things like that when you don't have foot traffic and you're shutting down, of course, they're having to deal with everything dealing with that. So we're dealing with that. We're staying close to those customers. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have set aside a reserve for what we feel is appropriate based predominantly on our commercial customers. And that's really where we're seeing the impact at this point. Residential, we're not seeing an impact at this time, having to do with the concern with that. But we're staying close to those large customers to try to help mitigate whatever we can and also work with our long-term customers that we've had relationships with. We want to help them to survive this as best we can, and we're going to work with them as appropriate. But then we'll take the needed steps from there. Mario Cortellacci : Great. And then just one more, and I'll turn it over. Obviously, you guys have had great strength in residential, and congratulations on that. But I guess just -- I think that's obviously being driven from the work-from-home dynamics. But I guess, just are you seeing anything little deeper down below the surface that we're not seeing? Is there anything that could be causing maybe a shift or a step-up in the long-term trajectory of the residential growth rate? Paul Northen : I would point to two things. I would point to, one, the continued growth of our mosquito product. If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there. Gary Rollins : Eddie, if I could add one thing. We've been investing quite heavily in technology. And one of those areas, in particular, is provide the customer more ways that they can pay us. And before we had the quarterly customer and they paid at the end of the previous quarter. And now they can pay by monthly. So there's other ways that they can pay, and that's been highly acceptable. And I think Eddie made a real good comment about, if our customer has multiple services, and we call it bundling, so typically that starts when they're sold. And that's helped a lot as far as customer satisfaction is concerned. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Michael Hoffman : I appreciate the time. I'd like to try and thread in some of the previous questions and maybe tease out a little bit of clarity, and somehow ask 2 questions and turn into 10, right? Gary, your comment about VitalClean is -- I think what you were trying to say is even if I'm not open yet, I know I'm going to be, I better start the pest service because it's -- you're getting in positions. That was the point. Not VitalClean, I meant the -- well, that's part of VitalClean. But is that part of your comment about commercial, is that some are even doing the pest service even though they're not opening yet, but they expect to be open, that was part of what you were indicating? Because of the... Gary Rollins : Well, the part of that VitalClean is taking place right now is more and more companies are coming back. And they've read about the dangers. They know more about the dangers of the virus and so forth. And they also, from a PR point -- HR point of view, they want to be able to tell their employees what they're doing to maintain good health practices. So that's been a wonderful factor as far as this past quarter, and it will be beyond. I mean if the experts are ready and are correct, then we should be seeing a continuation of this group of customers. Michael Hoffman : And some customers restarted pest without being back open again because of your infestation comment? Paul Northen : Yes. I think that's what we've seen as the time has gone by is that... Michael Hoffman : Okay. That's what I was trying to understand better. Okay. And then on June 30, you all filed a 13D with regards to the original trust and dissolve that trust and there's a distribution. Are those distributions done? Are there any restrictions on those shares with regards to how they can be traded or not or can -- having redistributed all those shares, are those individual smaller trusts now allowed to do whatever they want with the shares? Paul Northen : Mike, there was no material change. This has been updated multiple times throughout the years and just an update that was needed for the most recent setup that they have. Michael Hoffman : Okay, but that didn't answer the question about trading restrictions on the shares. Paul Northen : I did say that if you go back and read it, that I did say that there were no material changes. This was just an update that they've done periodically over time. Operator : There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor over to Gary for closing comments. Gary Rollins : Thank you. I want to thank you for participating. We still -- unfortunately, there's more that we don't know than we do know. I think most of you will agree in just following the monthly dialogue and the spike and various components that are impacting the disease and -- but we meet weekly or every other weekly, our key management people, to evaluate the success that we're having in different aspects of our defensive and offensive policy. And I didn't know you're going to quote more on there's more known than unknown... Paul Northen : All right. It's so good. I have borrow it. Gary Rollins : I'm the copyright person here. But thank you for your support during these challenging times and look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Thank you, again. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes, Joe. Thank you. Good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our third quarter 2020 conference call. Before turning the call over to Eddie to read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer. First, I want to take a moment to recognize the recent passing of our former Chairman and my brother Randall Rollins. Randall was an extraordinary human being and his accomplishments and contributions made at the various Rollins public and private companies over the years are unequal. He is missed greatly, not only by our family and his friends, but also by generations of Rollins employees and colleagues who he respected so highly. Many of you reached out with condolences upon receiving the news of his death. And I'd like to thank you for having our family in your thoughts, as well as for your kind words. Eddie, would you please read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer? Eddie Northen : Yes. Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. And actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. Looking at our third quarter performance, we were pleased to report another solid result. And we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to 79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as they were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first nine months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first nine months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our nine-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. Turning to our business lines results, residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic tool. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter and for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. Overall, our people and business continue to perform well and what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset and we're grateful for their efforts. Further our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard trust and confidence that our customers have in us. Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, as many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing [indiscernible] and strategic initiatives over the years. His promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins, President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pest control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He's successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam pest defense, Clark pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest, and OPC Services, as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, it's direction and it's future. We look forward to their continued contributions. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to be here. I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. While the Coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter, and how we're executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid, our call centers are busy and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged, yet at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we've been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as third quarter progressed and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time, have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. Still, we are by no way thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment, and with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We're executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees, as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer facing employees, we're continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective and quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we're pleased with a very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out west, as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now we have not had any significant business disruption. I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brand, which has experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include life trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America. And looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all. He is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years, improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. I'll now turn the call over to Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you, John. I believe at every reference it could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. In 2016, we held our first ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing over the time and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them had been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization, and as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside and our operations and non-operations groups had make tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insights to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E. And the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins book in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million, or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before tax was 115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman\u2019s Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for the vesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pensions divesting were non-cash items, Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year, compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. Looking at the first nine months revenue of $1.625 billion that was an increase of 7.6% of the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% of 2019. Net income was 198.2 million up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our gap earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration were income before taxes of $274.5 million up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the nine months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million one-time charge to revalue our inventory. With the pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense for Q2 of 2021. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenues increased 4.9% that included 1.4% from acquisition and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which is a small portion of that but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue was up 10.5% commercial ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down 1.9% and termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that residential was up 9%. Commercial ex-fumigation decreased 3.7% and termite ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well and the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic, with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses, as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as I referenced related to the inventory, revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased 714,000 to $22.4 million an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased 286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased 838,000 or five tenths of a percent to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent 79.9 million on acquisition compared to 431.2 million the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had 17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash of which 62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives such as Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local community. In 2021, our employee volunteered goals include community cleanup efforts, trafficking, education awareness, literacy programs and support of the United Way to name a few. Rollins has committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a three for two stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020 for stockholders a record at the close of business, November 10, 2020. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead, sir. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning to Gary, my condolences once again to you and your family on the passing of your brother. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Just a few questions this morning. On the last conference call, Eddie, you mentioned that you hit 10 out of 10 record new sales days in June and July. Now, how did your new sales trend through August and September does it remain elevated or did you see a return to more normalized sales patterns as you exited that peak selling season? Eddie Northen : Yes, Tim. Thanks. Yes, we didn't highlight that today. And I don't know if we necessarily duplicated that that number that we had shared before. But I think based on what we reported as far as the revenue gains, you can see that they were elevated especially on the residential side. And our call center did the much higher activity, has seen in previous years, even as we started to come out of the season and move into some cooler areas, as we've seen. Again, the majority of that was on the residential side. But we have seen incremental improvements on the commercial side as well, for some of the smaller businesses that would come through our call center for that. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. On the margins, EBITDA margins were particularly strong this quarter, nearly 24%. Is there any way for you to quantify for us how much of this is from the temporary cost cuts that you implemented earlier this year? I'm trying to figure out how much of this expansion in margin we've seen recently a structural from your routing and scheduling, for example, versus how much of this is more of a temporary dynamic? Eddie Northen : Well, there's no question that routing and scheduling is paying great dividends for us now, especially as we're having to have technicians potentially adjust and change some routes that they maybe would have historically run on both sides, on the residential as we're growing gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year, stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which is positive. And I think those types of things to the point of your question are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed, as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back, had been brought back at this point in time. And I think that our both our operations and our non-operations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways as many organizations have to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. So I don't have a defined answer and exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth we'll get a more and better and clear answer to that. The good news is from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted, even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side, come back into the business. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. And what I think you pretty much did answer\u2026 Operator : Excuse me, this the operator only two questions per participant, and then you can reenter the question queue after that. The next question is from Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. Seth Weber : And I'd also like to extend my condolences to everybody there. I want to ask about the commercial business. You mentioned that trends improved sequentially month-to-month. And I was just wondering, I think you said for the quarter, organic was down about 3.7. Can you just talk about, did it end up with September in positive territory in the commercial side? Or is that still trending negative through September? Thanks. John Wilson : Yes. I think we're still negative. We have a few different operations that have some heavy concentration in areas that are the most impacted right now. And we have a heavy concentration in New York City area, those of you that are there around that area know and understand the impact of what's going on there. But we're definitely seeing improvements in other areas that have been an opportunity to open back up and as businesses have been able to make those decisions. And our sales group continues to do a good job looking and working on those verticals, where we know that there's less impact. On the healthcare side and on logistics and those things like that, they continue to do a nice job, but in those areas. So positive improvements, but I wouldn't say that we're positive quite yet. Seth Weber : Okay. And then, a follow up on that, I think I heard in some of the SG&A discussion that bad debt expense actually got better. Can you just talk about your collection efforts and what kind of trends you're seeing on the commercial side with respect to any kind of customer pain or just extensions that are happening on the commercial side specifically on the collections? Thanks. Eddie Northen : On the collection side, on the residential side is where we saw our improvements that occurred. And those were in our larger brands and if you think about our larger brands that are going to have residential bases -- large residential bases, our Orkin brand or HomeTeam brands, our Clark brand, all have larger residential bases. And we were able to see improvements there. On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle, we made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2 with our customers that we made the decision to do that with, we really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high profile bankruptcies that you read about that we read about a lot of those, in cases, our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year, so well before the pandemic occurred, as they were on our watch list, we were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower but on the residential side with a positive impact. Operator : We have a question from Mario Cortellacci, Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Mario Cortellacci : I'd also like to send my condolences to all of you and Gary and your family. I'm very sorry for your loss. My question is around the disinfecting business and specifically in commercial. I guess, could you give us a sense of what kind of uptick you're seeing there, how much uptake you're seeing from customers. And the reason why I'm asking is just to understand how much of the improvement in revenue and on the commercial side has been this offset from the disinfectant business versus having customers come back, either coming back, or increasing the amount of service that they're getting. Eddie Northen : I'm sure John's going to have some comments that he'd like to add. But I would say if you look at those two categories, it would be more weighted towards customers coming back. But the disinfectant, the new services, in many of our brands has been a positive impact for us to be able to go through and add on the revenue side. What we see from the disinfectant side, customers that have had some sort of incident occur, that need to ensure that they have this taken care of and the cleanliness in their workplace, either for their customers or for their employees those are the ones that we have a shorter sales cycle for, and that one need to get something in place. Others that know, this is the right thing to do, but aren't necessarily under that same pressure, we had a little bit of a longer sales cycle. And we're learning as we continue to move forward. But it continues to grow for us. But I would say if you had to differentiate between those two, that we've had more incremental business that has come back. John Wilson : Yes. You're exactly right, the impact from that of -- in Orkin, we call it bottle cleaner, various brands have different names that they're calling it as they go to market. But the impact of the gap for commercial revenue to a year ago is very small from bottle clean, most of it has been from customers returning to services, their needs change. Eddie Northen : We don't have a lot of view of things that are kind of outside of our area where we are, as we know, most of us aren't traveling these days. We just know what our view is here in Georgia. And a lot of things have opened back up and are more close to what we knew before. And you contrast that with something like the New York City area where it is significantly different than what it was like before. So it's those pockets that are seeing those incremental improvements, that we're able to see customers come back and we're able to continue to be able to service them. Gary Rollins : Could I add one thing, Eddie? We're very fortunate that that in most of our commercial accounts hospitality related, health related they can put the service off indefinitely. They know that the best will come back, the way they got started to begin with receiving merchandise from outside and so forth. So that's a positive thing that we're disappointed when they differ a service. But our experience has been is they will be back. And I think, our numbers have showing that. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you. And then, just on M&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mr. Michael Hoffman. Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. And like my colleagues, we wish your family the best, Gary. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Michael Hoffman : Two questions I have are focused on organic growth and then on margins. On the organic growth side. we're noticing across the Stifel coverage broadly, that work from home is having interesting, positive -- mostly positive consequences. I point to like Pentair reported extraordinary pool numbers, and so on and so forth. Can you disaggregate the 9% and help us understand how much is being influenced by people all at home and so they're ordering maybe adding mosquito and tick and or that you spoke to the wildlife number, versus its net new customer ads, so we can understand the influence? And then what are your thoughts about how that starts to anniversary? Eddie Northen : Yes. Thank you, Michael. We don't break out customers and things like that, I will tell you that we have had great new customer growth. But I can't really -- I don't know really know exactly, how much of this is being driven by someone at home that is adding the mosquito versus that they would want the mosquito. Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30% plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base of what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now, as far as, when it comes down to [indiscernible], can't answer that either just because we just don't know. We don't know that people continue to work from home, where we have situations where there's an additional need for more services. We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher, because, as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase and [indiscernible] it in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there. So, big customer growth and probably the best that we can say at this point. Michael Hoffman : Okay. On the margin side between gross margins and then as a cost to SG&A. So the gross margin came down 100 basis points sequentially, which makes sense if you're bringing back furloughed people. We flushed out the sort of that returning a people issue. And then on the SG&A side, you clearly have shown a lot of discipline in the management of that in an absolute dollar basis, as well as percent of revenue. How much of that is annual accrual things that will come back versus is permanent? Eddie Northen : I will take the first part of your question, I think we've pretty much moved through all the furloughed process that we had just a very small number, that would still be -- we could be making decisions on but I think Q2 we saw the majority that Q3. It's kind of moved through. On the structural side on the SG&A, like I was answering earlier, we're leaner than we were when we went into this. We did have some positive impact that impacted through our bad debt. But we also saw very strong improvements in our administrative salaries, as well as our personnel related. So structurally on the people side, I think Q2 and Q3 we're seeing kind of similar trends there. And, we use technology to be able to make us better and be able to make us more efficient as we're moving forward. Operator : We have a further question from Mr. Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead sir. Tim Mulrooney : Hey, thanks for taking my next question. Eddie, I just wanted to follow up on your previous answer to me. The way you said that one of your greatest improvements and reduction of miles driven was this quarter. Is that due to anything that you're -- I guess doing differently or are your branches just becoming more mature? On the VRM system, I guess maybe I'm just looking for a general update on where you're at with your tech initiatives and rollout? Eddie Northen : Yes. So yes, I would say two things and John's got something to add as well. I think two things to say. One maturity continues to move forward in time. As we continue to have retention of our technicians that's going to be a positive thing for us. But we had these four stages of routing and scheduling. And we're in this -- we're kind of in this phase two of this four stage and as we continue to layer on additional technology pieces that are kind of behind the scenes for the operation, that's going to continue to drive improvements. So I would say improvements will continue to be positive as we're moving forward. John Wilson : Yes. I will add two things, Eddie, and the first one is very similar, but greater adoption, Tim, no doubt with our branch operations. But then also greater density with huge amount of residential customers, we've added commercial coming back. We just have greater density on our routes. Gary Rollins : One other thing that we had to look forward too, we did not have all of our brands on our routing and scheduling. Eddie Northen : That's right. Gary Rollins : So we've got I guess what we're converting now \u2013 John Wilson : [Indiscernible] converted, and then we have other brands that we're adding as well. But, yes you're right, as we talk about this four phases, that's exactly. Gary Rollins : That's always a good time. If you have the people that want it, they adapt it so much quicker than a normal situation. You have to convince them. Endof Q&A: Operator : Gary? Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better, improve our customers experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update with our fourth quarter call in the future. Thanks again.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. While we faced unprecedented obstacles this past year, I\u2019m pleased to report that Rollins\u2019 performance in 2020 is marked by continued growth and solid financials. Rollins\u2019 results are a testament to the strength of our business, our exceptional focus on customer service and the commitment to program execution by our people. We are especially proud of our employees\u2019 dedication and adaptability through this difficult year. They have continued to provide vital services to our customers through very challenging situations, enabling the continuation of our long-term success. Our people are truly our most important asset as they protect our customers\u2019 property, health and peace of mind. We are extremely appreciative of their efforts during this unprecedented time. At Rollins, we also have an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe. This has never been more important than this past year, where we faced the threat of the COVID-19 virus. New stringent safety protocols were promptly created and even today remain a priority, while we continue to have employee health risk from the virus. As a result of working safely through the pandemic, we\u2019ve also benefited from the trust we have built with our customers. This was confirmed by the strong performance that we had in our residential services segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our business and the importance of the service we provided. Before I wrap up, on behalf of the entire team at Rollins, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank our two retiring directors, Jimmy Williams, he joined the Board in 1978 and Bill Dismuke, who joined the Board in 1984. Their insightful guidance and service to the company has been invaluable and we wish them well in their retirement. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide an overview of the quarter and the year. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. Turning to our performance, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped off a great year in 2020. Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $536.3 million compared to $506 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year. Revenue for the full year totaled $2.161 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $2.015 billion for 2019. Net income for the full year increased to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to $203.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there are two adjustments impacting our financials. Overall, our team members in the various businesses continue to perform well. We experienced strong growth in residential pest control during the fourth quarter, increasing 11%, while termite and ancillary services grew 8.7%. Year-over-year, commercial revenue was down as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the COVID virus due to varying levels of government-driven shutdowns. However, we have continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April with fourth quarter commercial growth only 0.6% below last year. We are pleased with the steady progress we have achieved under these circumstances. I am very proud of our team and the commitment they show each day to take care of our customers. Their dedication and determination were very evident this year as they added many thousands of customers during a challenging time. We believe our fourth quarter and 2020 full year results reflect both the resilience of our company and our people. I would now like to take a moment to talk about Rollins\u2019 ESG or Environmental, Social and Governance commitment. We hold ourselves accountable to a high standard of sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate governance. ESG is not just an important part of our business it\u2019s become part of our culture. We also have launched a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative, internally focused on advancing a culture of inclusion where all employees feel respected and treated fairly with an equitable opportunity to excel. This effort is sponsored by Freeman Elliott, our Orkin U.S. President. Freeman is working in close partnership with the newly formed Advisory Council made up of employees from across all brands to drive DEI improvements. The council is actively reviewing all policies, conducting campaign awareness, creating listening forums and providing training with much more to come. We are committed to this vision in the journey we will all take together. I am also pleased to note that we have further strengthened our Board of Directors, adding to an already experienced and strong Board with the additions of Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Jerry Nix. As background, both Susan Bell and Patrick Gunning have recently retired from distinguished careers in public accounting, 36 and 39 years respectively. Both are qualified as financial experts for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public companies. Jerry Nix comes to our Board as the Former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company. They are all seasoned executives and accomplished leaders and their diverse experience will be invaluable to help shape Rollins\u2019 future. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thanks, John and good morning everybody. Although I have been with Rollins Company since 1999 and have had the opportunity over the years to interact with many of the investors on today\u2019s call, this is my first time speaking with you as Chief Operating Officer. I do so with a strong sense of responsibility to our company, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I am excited to be here. I would also like to thank all of our colleagues for the smooth transition over the last few months and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy. During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand the company\u2019s presence, not only in the U.S., but yet globally as well. We added 10 strategic acquisitions within the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore. We are very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands, and as we enter 2021, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. This past week, we completed our first virtual companywide leadership meeting with all our top leaders across all our global business units. While we missed being in the same room together, we still found an opportunity to gather on Zoom for productive discussions on items that will be critical for our success in 2021. As an example, one focus area we discussed that has been significant to our growth is mosquito service. This continues to be an excellent add-on service for many customers and has increased greater than 30% over the prior year. We know this will continue to be a great opportunity in 2021. As we have discussed in the past, mosquito-borne diseases continue to be an increasing threat around the world and as family self quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. The overall emphasis of our leadership meeting was about executing our plans in 2021, and I have great confidence in our leadership team to make this happen. Now, let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Jerry. The obstacles that impacted Q2 and Q3 continue to decrease throughout the quarter and our operations and non-operations groups continue to make tremendous adjustments to the new lives that we are all leading. We are utilizing mostly remote workforces, which has forced us to continue to evaluate processes and become more efficient. These changes have made us a better company. We are also thankful that we have invested in technology the way that we have over the last 4 to 5 years. Dealing with the increased demand on the residential side of our business and the disruption aroused on the commercial side of our business would have been an extreme challenge to handle without these tools in place. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included a fourth year in a row of metric improvement through our routing and scheduling initiatives, safety improvement that translated to expense reductions and successful continued cost containment implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP financials for the quarter and GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the full year that were impacted by accelerated investing of shares in the third quarter of this year, and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins\u2019 books in 2019. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $536.3 million was an increase of 6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue of $506 million. Our income before income taxes was $86.9 million or 28.7% above 2019. Net income was $62.6 million, up 23.4% compared to 2019. Our EPS were $0.13 per diluted share. Looking at the full year, revenue of $2.161 billion was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year\u2019s revenue of $2.015 billion. Our GAAP income before taxes was $354.7 million or 35.8% above 2019. Our net income was $260.8 million, up 28.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 per diluted share. For the full year, looking at our non-GAAP financials, taking into account the accelerated stock vesting that occurred in the third quarter of this year and the pension plan moving off of our books in 2019, income before taxes was $361.4 million and was up 16.2% and net income was $267.5 million this year compared to $229.9 million in 2019, a 16.3% increase, and our non-GAAP EPS were $0.54 compared to $0.47, which is a 14.9% improvement. Jerry mentioned our 2021 leadership meeting, and while our gathering online instead of in-person looked different than the previous years, our focus on messaging and alignment for the year to come continue to be the same. One of the sessions over the three days was entitled, items to make you successful in 2021. During this segment, we discussed several different topics that will impact our journey of sustainability through Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG. The topics were all focused on actionable items that each and every operation can impact as we move forward in the new year. In depth, we discussed our routing and scheduling and how it saves miles, improves margin and helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Next, we discussed our launch of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative that John mentioned earlier. Freeman did an excellent job sharing how a more diverse group will help lead our decision-making in the future. And then, Jerry spent time and discussed our safety journey and how this positively impacts our workforce and our financial performance. The advantage to hosting these sessions online, and yes, I am looking for silver linings here, is that we get a chance to read comments in real-time as the speaker is leading the session. There was a very positive energy around all of these topics and others that will support our sustainability for years to come. Let\u2019s take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6% included 1.5% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.5% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 11%, commercial, excluding fumigation, commercial pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down five-tenth of a percent and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 8.7%. One item of note is that our wildlife service grew at their fastest rate since Q1 of 2018. Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4.5% and from that residential was up 9.3%, commercial ex-fumigation decreased 2.4%, and termite and ancillary grew by 8.4%. Our residential business continues to perform well and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our cost appropriately, it\u2019s difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 50.3% from 49.7% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. These gains were offset by higher materials and supplies cost related to our personal protective equipment inventory. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $203,000 to $22.4 million, a decrease of nine-tenth of a percent. Depreciation decreased $57,000 and amortization of intangible assets decreased $148,000 as intangibles from previous acquisitions such as HomeTeam and Western became fully amortized. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $159.1 million or 29.7% of revenue. This was down 2.9% compared to 2019 and the quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits and lower bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the period-ended December 31, 2020, we spent $147.4 million on acquisitions compared to $430.6 million the same period last year, which included our initial Clark Pest Control acquisition. We paid $160.5 million on dividend and had $23.2 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. These numbers all include our reduction in debt of $88.5 million for the year. As you may remember, we kicked off the reporting of our ESG activities at the beginning of the year in 2020 with our first ever 2019 Sustainability Report. In March of 2021, we will produce our second addition, which will include more updates and goals in the areas that will impact our company over the next five years. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which was a 50% increase in the pre-split numbers from last year that will be paid on March 10, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2021. Gary, I will turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, everybody. Congrats on another nice quarter. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Tim Mulrooney : So, okay. Only two questions, so here we go. I\u2019m going to stick on the pricing and gross margin. So first of all, on pricing, Eddie, can you remind me just how that trended through 2020? I know a lot of folks took a pause on pricing during the pandemic. I\u2019m curious how pricing looked in 2020 and what you guys are planning or thinking about for the next pest selling season here in 2021? Eddie Northen : Yes. Tim, we decided to \u2013 for most of our brands, to take that same pause. As you know, typically, we will roll that price increase out around mid-year. We decided based on the current economic conditions that it was not the best time to move that forward, so most of our brands did in fact take that pause. For 2021, we do have plans to move forward with a price increase. And we would be prepared as we move forward over the next quarter or two to be able to provide more details having to do with that. But we\u2019ve gone through our \u2013 we continue to go through the testing on the marketing side and we\u2019re prepared for that for 2021. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, okay. Thank you. That\u2019s broadly what we\u2019re hearing from others as well, so that makes sense. So, as I\u2019m thinking about gross margin next year \u2013 and we saw some nice gross margin expansion this year, but as I\u2019m thinking about it next year, with increases in route density from new accounts and additional M&A, plus these potential price increases, is there any reason that gross margins wouldn\u2019t be expected to continue to expand further in 2021? I guess, are there any other considerations that investors should keep in mind when thinking about your margin? Eddie Northen : I would, believe \u2013 and I believe Jerry and John would believe the same that we will have an opportunity to expand in 2021. We have invested, as we talked in Q2 and Q3, on our inventory of protective equipment for our employees, our customer-facing employees. Our hopes would be as we move through 2021 that that would subside and that that would be somewhat of a support for us. We continue to have good, positive momentum as we talked about a couple of times, having to do with our routing and scheduling and we\u2019ll continue to see and reap the benefits of that. And I think to your point of the density, as commercial were to continue to incrementally get better as we\u2019re all hoping as we move through 2021, that density will improve and make those improvements potentially even better. So we believe, we have a few different areas that would be supportive of it in addition to what we would normally do as far as our incremental improvement on a year-over-year basis. John Wilson : Yes. Tim, this is John Wilson. And Eddie touched on a couple of things that I would have had to offer and that was the routing and scheduling in the account density piece. But related to the selling of our new accounts, you had already asked a question about the price increase that we\u2019ll roll with, we didn\u2019t see any back-up in our ability to get price for our new accounts. And so, we expect that to continue to grow for 2021 and that will help as well. Tim Mulrooney : Understood. Thanks, John. Thanks, Eddie. Eddie Northen : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, thanks for the time. Could you maybe update us on how sustainable you think that resi growth is at these levels? As we get into 2021, obviously, there\u2019s going to be tougher comps and potentially as people head back to work with the vaccine, maybe you see a slightly less demand? I just wanted to get a sense for \u2013 if you think that could put a damper on 2021 resi growth? Eddie Northen : So I would say a couple of things. One is that we don\u2019t know what the return to work is going to look like and you\u2019re exactly right. I mean, comping as we move throughout the year will be more difficult than what it would be during a normal year. Q1 will be a time that we\u2019ve not lapped yet as things really didn\u2019t make a change until the end of March. So Q1, I think we\u2019ll probably still see what we\u2019ve seen. As people were to return, will that reduce the demand? I think that\u2019s kind of yet to be seen at this point. The positive for us is \u2013 and Jerry talked about this is the sale of our mosquito product. As we continue to do that, that product continues to grow at a 30% plus clip on a growing base. And probably, the exciting thing for me is that we\u2019ve really expanded the opportunity for growth with this particular service to many of our different brands. So early on, we had a few of our brands that really were concentrating on this and this is really expanded to others. So we believe this is going to be a good residential opportunity for us as we move forward. But Mario, I think we\u2019re all kind of guessing right now on what that impact of the stay from home is going to look at \u2013 look like as we kind of move throughout the year. Mario Cortellacci : Great. And then, you have actually just mentioned, and I\u2019ll piggyback off of the mosquito comment. I guess, maybe if you can talk about some of the biggest opportunities you had, it sounds like the mosquito is obviously one of them, we know about that, while we know that you guys launched the disinfectant service, would you be able to give us maybe an update on penetration on those services? And then, also, is there anything else that\u2019s in its infancy or in early innings that we should also maybe keep an eye on? Eddie Northen : So I would say that \u2013 I made the comment about wildlife. Our wildlife continues to grow, I think the infrastructure that we put in place over the last 2 to 3 years with Steve Leavitt, leading the charge there with our emerging opportunities group has really made a positive impact for \u2013 I\u2019ll call it a nice add on. So we get those calls in our call center and now, we have a broader reach to be able to service those customers that have those types of wildlife needs. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to have opportunities there. Mosquito, we\u2019ve already talked about. In the past, we\u2019ve talked some about bed bug. Bed bug revenue is down year-over-year. Part of that is our own decision on pricing. And looking at the profitability of that compared to us putting the energy behind the mosquito product, which is a high \u2013 much higher margin product. But then I would shift over to the termite and ancillary side and say, we have continued opportunities to grow there as we have had entered the premises in a lot of cases having to do with the termite support and then providing those ancillary services in other parts of the home. And we had good growth in these areas over the last few years and I would say that will continue to be an opportunity. John Wilson : Yes. Mario, let me \u2013 this is John, let me add. The opportunity to couple multiple services with our current customer base is really pretty high. We have less than 20% of our customers that have multiple services. And so, when we can do that and we\u2019ve had good success adding mosquito, what Eddie mentioned wildlife and some other things that opportunity there is there for us in 2021 to really build on. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you for that. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would add too, that we also had an opportunity for mosquito in the commercial sector as more and more people are eating outdoors, wanting to spend time in restaurants not being cooped up inside, we\u2019re seeing more outside. So we have opportunity on commercial to also drive mosquito business as well. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you so much for your time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael, please make sure your line is not muted. Michael Hoffman : Yes. We all have to learn about that this year, don\u2019t we? Thank you for taking the questions. What I\u2019d like to ask about is disaggregating the organic part of residential both in the quarter and for the year to understand the mix of new customer add as a proportion of 9 :3 in the quarter and 8 :7 for the year versus the cross-sell and that sort of ties into the comment of less than 20% of the customer base today has more than one service. I\u2019m trying to understand, how much is in the 9 :3 was adding a service versus adding a customer? Eddie Northen : So I think the way that I would answer that question is, it\u2019s kind of like the growth of our international volume as a percent to our total. We continue to add new geographies internationally, we continue to add new companies as we did most recently in Australia to our international operations, but our percent of our international to our total continues to hover around that same 7% or 8%, no matter what we do internationally, because of the growth that we have in the U.S, those numbers, they kind of stay intact. And I would just use that analogy Michael to kind of say, we\u2019re kind of doing the same thing here. So we\u2019re adding a significant number of new customers but at the same time, we are adding new services to existing customers. So as much as we continue to look for those penetration opportunities, it\u2019s a good problem to have that that number necessarily isn\u2019t improving significantly as far as those that have more than one service, because we are adding new customers each and every quarter. So we will continue once we have our foot in the door to continue to add those new services and as we\u2019ve shared on this call before, any time we have more than one service, the likelihood of that customer retaining and staying with us is significantly higher. So we\u2019ll continue to pursue that on that second or third or more services, but we\u2019re also happy on the new customer growth as well. Michael Hoffman : Okay, I just want to ask clarification there, but I want to ask my second question to make sure I can get it in. So can you help us with cadence? So everybody appreciates the way things flowed in \u201820 in total, things we ought to be aware of as we progressed through \u201821 and you alluded to, we haven\u2019t anniversaried the negative headwinds through 1Q, but can you \u2013 without it being percentage numbers, can you help us mildly positive in one, meaningfully positive in two, and then it settles back, this is all the organic side into sort of normal course in three and four? Is that the right way to think about it? Eddie Northen : I would say, the things that in my mind are the most impactful, and Jerry and John and Gary may have some other thoughts. The things that I would say are most impactful were Q \u2013 end of Q1, end of Q2, with our headwind of materials and supplies that occurred in 2020 that we feel will not be a headwind as we\u2019re moving through 2021 based on everything that we know today, we feel like that we have made those purchases. As we talked about in Q3, we actually had to write down our inventory because in Q2, we purchased at a very high price in some cases to be able to get that protective equipment in place, which was the right thing to do at the time and continue to move our business forward, but we feel as though that will be a good tailwind for us, especially as we move Q2, Q3, Q4. I would say on the residential side, Mario or you asked a question on what that looks like for us. Q1, we really don\u2019t have a account for that, because really things didn\u2019t go south with us there until the end of March. But I think the stay-at-home from there will continue to be at play and will continue to drive demand as well as the continued concentration on the other services that we talked about. And I would think that incrementally, we may see a little bit more of a headwind on that as we move to Q3 into Q4 of 2021. However, the offset of that would be, if things are getting back to normal and if people are going back to work that would mean that the commercial product should in fact be going the other way. The commercial product should be improving incrementally as we move Q2, into Q3, into Q4 when we look at this year-over-year. So for all those times when we had investors ask us, why we didn\u2019t concentrate only on the commercial product, and I said, I was very happy with the different products that we had to be able to sell because in diversification, I think, Michael, we\u2019re going to see a little bit of that as we move through this that yes, in fact, if stay at home does kind of subside some then the commercial should see a good improvement as we move forward. Did that help? Michael Hoffman : Yes, it does. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Thanks for squeezing me back in. I just wanted to talk about M&A for a second. So if we step back and look at the full year of 2020, can you talk about \u2013 how many acquisitions did you complete in total? I\u2019m just curious if the pace was greater or lower relative to prior years given disruption from the pandemic or if that was pretty similar? Eddie Northen : Hey, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to let Jerry and John weigh in with any specific they have, but it was similar in nature as far as the number. Our concern, of course, the 2019 number, as I mentioned, was \u2013 would be significantly skewed with our initial Clark Pest Control purchase that we made but I think the number and even taking a look kind of generally at a spread of international and of Orkin tuck-in acquisitions and others like that, I think we\u2019re relatively in line with what we\u2019ve seen with previous years. Jerry Gahlhoff : That\u2019s correct, Eddie. It\u2019s about flat to prior year. Eddie Northen : Okay, alright. There we go. Tim Mulrooney : Perfect. And you have valuations pulled back at all given all this disruption or have they all kind of been on par with what you typically see? John Wilson : Tim, this is John. They have not pulled back. There things are still pretty frothy from that side and we\u2019re kind of picking and choosing the one who will really want to go after heart as a result of that. We want to buy really good businesses with great reputation in the market and the McCall business in Jacksonville is a \u2013 the most recent example. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. I saw that and that looks like a good one. Can I squeeze one more in for Gary? Gary Rollins : Hey, you get one follow-up question. So there you go. Tim Mulrooney : Excellent. Gary, this one\u2019s for you, do you still plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever the balance sheet in 2021 or does having some debt on the balance sheet make sense? Gary Rollins : Well, I think we take on more debt if we had to with the right acquisition. Tim Mulrooney : Sure. Gary Rollins : I mean that\u2019s been our practice. In the past, we\u2019ve retired what \u2013 an $88.5 million just this last year. We retired $80 million of our debt, but certainly, if the right acquisitions came along, we\u2019d incur more debt, if we add to. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much guys. Eddie Northen : I do need to clarify one thing, before we turn it over to Gary to wrap up. In my statement \u2013 in my prepared statement when I talked about our quarterly dividend increasing, I think it should have been that our quarterly dividend increased over the fourth quarter dividend that we had. So if you remember back to 2020, we actually reduced our dividend from our first quarter of 2020 down for the remainder of the year. So the improvement that I mentioned should have referenced the fact that it was compared to the Q4 dividend. So I hope that clarifies and I apologize for misstating that earlier. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael Hoffman : Thank you for letting me to follow-up. And you have to keep letting the fellas from Jefferies ask it first, then I can do the follow to him. So the M&A question I had was, can you tell us what the dollar of revenue that rolls into \u201821 from deals you did in \u201820 so we get that accurate? Eddie Northen : We don\u2019t break that out, Mike. Yes, Mike, we don\u2019t break that out. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then, the dividend, what\u2019s it take for the dividend to go back to $0.12 a quarter, post-split? Eddie Northen : Well, if that was the confusion, I think, partially that I just \u2013 are you saying post-split? Michael Hoffman : Yes. So, post \u2013 I mean if you cut it from after you\u2019d split it, it would have been $0.12. So you cut it from $0.12 to $0.08, if I\u2019ve done my math correctly. What\u2019s it take for you to return it back to $0.12? Eddie Northen : I mean, the Board would have to review our current cash, our opportunities to be able to use that cash and then to pass back onto the shareholders. I mean, compared to where we were in Q4 and then we split our shares, it\u2019s an increase from there. Michael Hoffman : Right, thank you. Gary Rollins : Alright. Do you see any other questions? Operator : Well, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Okay. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we entered 2021 optimistic about our opportunities and look forward to updating you on our progress on our next earnings call. Thank you, again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964. Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only 2 Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. Randall Rollins was inducted as well. Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. On behalf of the entire Rollins family of employees, thank you, Henry. We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided. I'd also like to acknowledge Lee Crump's recent retirement from Rollins as Chief Information Officer. Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. We wish Lee all the best in his retirement. He's earned it. In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. They truly are our most valuable asset. While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year. Let me now turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results. Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials. It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020. Next, I, too, would like to acknowledge the notable impact Mr. Tippie has made, not only on our company but with me, as well. I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus. They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward. We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee. As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. While we have spent the last 6 months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our businesses. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment. Turning to our mosquito service. As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future. Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry. Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands. Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations. Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in 2 additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. Eddie Northen : Thank you, Jerry. I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company. For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter. Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020. This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. As we move from what we would call Stage 2 to Stage 3 of our 5-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience. Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021. In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest 3 expense areas. At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : So you had a really strong year last year on the residential side. And I think one of the big questions on everyone's mind is how that might translate to organic growth in 2021. You've got some difficult comparisons coming up over the next several quarters in residential pest. But as I sit back, I'm thinking, then again, we're still largely in a work-from-home environment and I have to think that a lot of the accounts that you signed up last year are probably now finally turning profitable up to the third or fourth visit. So taking all that into account, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the residential side of the business as we continue to emerge from this pandemic. Eddie Northen : Yes. So Tim, this is Eddie. So we're seeing continued good demand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have overall good weather in the first quarter. Don't know what that will look like as we move throughout the remainder of the year. But I think one of the things that we're seeing, and I think we're all living this in real time is we're seeing more of this hybrid work environment. So it's not only people necessarily working from home. They're not only working from the office, but we're seeing more of this hybrid environment, which we believe is still going to have some eyes that's going to create that demand that we've seen as we move through 2020. You see the numbers here. Our lead generation as we go into Q2 is still very strong for us, and that's starting to lap some of those numbers that you already talked about. So I don't know that any of us know exactly what this will look like as the entire year plays out. But I think there are things that are positive for us to be able to continue to see demand as we're moving forward. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. I appreciate those comments and good color on the lead generation. If I could pivot, I know I think it was Jerry that was talking about the technology that you're implementing BOSS in - or Orkin Canada. I know that's not new news, but I'm not sure I heard about Western before. So just curious if you could give us an update on maybe your technology rollout plans this year. Are there any other \"specialty brands\" that you're planning to roll out BOSS or VRM to any incremental, I guess, technology investments to keep in mind as we model out your expenses for 2021? Eddie Northen : Yes. I'll answer and then let Jerry follow up from there. So yes, Orkin, we're a little bit further down the path as far as getting things moving more towards maturity. We've added Western to that queue. They're moving down the path of maturity. We'll take a pause at this point in time, make sure that we work through and then we get the benefits from those 2 units or those 2 brands before we were to make a decision or anything else. And we would let you know ahead of time that there was going to be anything significant to change our CapEx as a percent of revenue or anything else like that. But we - I always say, from a modeling standpoint, within the historic range of what we've seen over the last few years, is what our plans are right now. And if we make a decision to change that, we'll let you know what we know about that moving forward. Gary Rollins : One thing I'd add to that, Eddie, there's technology improvements when we buy another company because typically, they don't have the best phone systems. They're not paying the best rates for communications. And there are some products available within the industry that, in some cases, are upgrades from what they currently have. So although BOSS is certainly important is going to be critical to our future. We are able to help these newly acquired companies with something short of BOSS. And of course, that will be on their plate in the future. Does that help... Tim Mulrooney : Very helpful. Operator : The next question is from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : I just wanted to ask about organic growth. You guys are using the significant acquisitions verbiage when you're referring to, I guess, organic growth now. Are you able to provide what organic growth looks like, less all acquisitions in resi, commercial and in termite? Eddie Northen : This is - yes, thanks for that question. So we didn't mean to add confusion here. This is the same way that we've measured it every quarter, probably for the last 15 years. We were just trying to give a little bit of clarity around that part. If we were to - or when we acquire a small tuck-in acquisition of, let's just say, 5 technicians, we acquired them on a Thursday. On a Monday, they have new uniforms, they're in new vehicles, and they're embedded into that Orkin branch. And we really don't have a way for that very small piece to be able to kind of parse that out. So this is - again, this is the same way that we've looked at it every quarter, again, at least for the last 15 years. So we really don't look at it because it's such an insignificant number from that perspective. Mario Cortellacci : Just - and then maybe a follow-up to that. With those types of acquisitions, is the - are those like $1 million in revenue or like $500,000? Is it that insignificant that it's not even worth mentioning? Jerry Gahlhoff : That's absolutely correct. Eddie Northen : Yes. So again, we didn't mean to add confusion to this by wording that we have here. But again, this is the same way we've looked at it throughout time. And nothing else would be a part of it that would be material significant at all. Mario Cortellacci : Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up would be on the labor market. You guys actually said that you're seeing labor efficiencies and you're seeing, I guess, maybe savings there or coming in better than expected. And I think commentary from other companies is that they're seeing difficulty in hiring new labor, essentially competing with the government for people looking for jobs with stimulus and unemployment checks. Are you seeing anything similar to that within your new hires? And we've also heard that, I guess, smaller pest companies are even offering bonuses to new hires that they sign and then they work for the first 30 days or 60 days or whatever it is and they'll get an additional bonus for staying with them. Are you doing something similar? Or is that really not in the cards for you? Eddie Northen : Well, when we had demand levels that we've seen this quarter and even if you go back to last quarter that are significantly higher than what we would see on average and any times, it would always be a challenge to ensure that we're finding a hiring and retaining the right employees. The good news for us, and I'll kind of move to specifically your question, the good news for us is as our technology continues to mature on the routing and scheduling part, it enables us to automatically be more efficient. So during my prepared remarks, I talked about, let's just say, a technician that maybe went out with 9 stops in a day and then at 10 :00 in the morning, someone called and said, well, they're not going to be available and not be home at 2 :00. In our old world, that 2 :00 slot basically would have gone empty and the technician would not have had anything to do. In this new world, the branch can see that in real time, our call center can see that in real time. So now when we have a new customer, we can slot a new customer into that time slot. So it's enabling us to continue to be more efficient with that, which is helping with that demand, with the new customer and also being able to move that existing customer as well. So with all that being said, with these demand levels, we are absolutely having issues to be able to go through and make sure that we're finding it and hiring the folks that we need to be able to keep the business moving forward. And HR group and the operations groups are doing a tremendous job with that. But it is a battle with the other companies that are out there that are offering some of the things that you've talked about. Jerry Gahlhoff : And this is Jerry. John and I recently had a meeting with branch managers in the field at Orkin about your #1 job or your #1 priority as a branch leader is recruiting and building your team. We put a high emphasis that - that's first and foremost, the most important thing you can do. So we place a lot of emphasis and have good processes and procedures behind that. But as Eddie said, it is getting tougher. We do offer referral bonuses, there's a lot of activities on friend and family referrals for new employees, things along those lines that also incentivize people if they get referred and they stay longer, we pay referral bonuses over time, things along those lines. So we take advantage of everything that we can get our hands on to help keep a competitive advantage in the search for talent. Eddie Northen : But again, this is nothing that's new - I mean, it might be a little bit more heightened at this moment right here, but this is nothing new for us in the service industry. We've gone - just in my time period that I've been here in 6 years, this is something that we're constantly focused on. John set the tone as far as the importance of that. Jerry set the tone as far as the importance of that over time. And we've been able to be successful with that, and we'll find ways to continue to be successful with it as we're moving forward as well. Gary Rollins : And the other piece of the staffing situation is retention. And we have created in Orkin and in Western and in Canada, we've created a better job. It was very frustrating for that pest control tech to have that cancellation that Eddie just described and really not beginning to unravel the day's route. And now we have the tools that we can move a customer to that slot - a new customer to that slot typically, and he doesn't have or she doesn't have that frustration that how am I going to get through? How am I going to get it done? This has created a mess that ratchets all the way down through the day, et cetera. So it's going to be interesting to see what this does to retention. It has to make a better job for the pest control technician in those areas that have BOSS. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Michael Hoffman : I met Henry Tippie almost at the very beginning of my career 33 years ago when I was covering Rollins Environmental, and he was - gave me sage advice then, which I've always followed in my modeling. So I wish him the best of luck. So the conversation about growth, and I get you're not doing anything different in the language of significant. But double-digit or very high single-digit organic growth in residential relative to the underlying market growth is phenomenal. So what are you doing different that you're producing that type of organic growth versus anybody else in the business because you're clearly gaining share in your well-run company? But what are you doing different, do you think, that allows, even if the comps have to come down because it's so strong last year, you're still gaining share? So what are you doing different? Eddie Northen : Michael, I think it's a very intuitive question to ask. And trust me, as we've gone through this time of these higher demand levels, we've continued to really drill down into that to get a better understanding. I talked again in my prepared remarks, we did have good weather that we're up against that created. But I think the essential worker status and the seriousness that we took with that, especially as the pandemic started, to me, I think, is one of the things that separated us, for sure, in the service industry, and I would say, separated us within our pest control industry as well. So we already had a very professional technician. As we've talked about previously, we invested in PPE very early on. And when you combine that together with that trusted person that you already have, we believe that, that separated us potentially from others that are out there. We've all had people in different service industries that maybe showed up to do some sort of work that looked disheveled, didn't look professional. And they could have been the best person to be able to do that job that you would hope. But the impression didn't come across positively. And we believe that our technicians across the board in all of our brands come across professionally. And we believe that essential worker status really translated into a trusted brand. And as people have felt more comfortable opening their homes over this last, I'll say, 3, 4, 5 months, we believe that's translated more into a trusted brand, a trusted name, I'm open to them coming into my home and it's really been a reflection of this demand that we've seen that we've been able to go through and grow our business with. So we think that those are a few things. When you couple that with these continued enhancements in the routing and scheduling and how our communication with our customers continues to improve, we believe those are things that continue to separate us from the competition that's out there and enabling us to win on high demand and to retain it at a high rate. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Fair enough. You all updated your corporate presentation recently. By the way, it was a nice change. Had to admit, it took me a moment to realize I was clicking through a book. Just trying to make it rotate a different way. But you put in there about a $12 billion domestic market. And yet the major trade associations defining it as $9.6 billion, growing a little bit less than 3% last year. What's - can you bridge the gap between your market size and PCT's market size? Eddie Northen : Michael, I have to get those numbers from you. I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to you probably later today or tomorrow. Let us talk to our marketing group and let's see what we can do to help out with the difference between those 2. Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're optimistic about Rollins' opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2021 conference call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Julie Bimmerman : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and other SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. Before we get started, you probably noticed that Eddie Northen is not joining us today on the call. John Wilson will share with you more about that now. John Wilson : Good morning. Yesterday, our Board of Directors appointed Julie Bimmerman, who many of you know, as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Eddie Northern has been moved into an operational role as Senior Vice President focused on sustainability. Julie has significant experience, both in finance and our industry as described in the press release we issued this morning. She has been with us since 2004, having most recently been Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Prior to joining Rollins, Julie worked in corporate accounting, internal audit and corporate tax audit role. She's known to many of you already and she will be available to analysts and institutional investors after the call as per usual. We also filed an 8-K updating developments in our SEC investigation this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Gary Rollins : Now to the exciting news. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter, and we remain well-positioned for 2021. John will share with you our recent additions to our Board of Directors, while Jerry and Julie will give you details of our financial results shortly. These results were made possible by the continued dedication and contribution of our incredible field and corporate teams. We truly appreciate their customer focus that has generated a significantly higher than normal growth and profitability so far in 2021. Now let me turn the call over to John. John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. Over the past year, we have enhanced and diversified Rollins' Board of Directors with several new additions. I'd like to spend a moment today welcoming our two newest Board members, Gregory Morrison and Donald Carson. As detailed in our May press releases, Greg was the former Chief Information Officer, who led the information technology operations for Cox Enterprises, and he will add cyber expertise to our Board. Don, having worked for many years in investment in commercial banking, including Wachovia Bank, brings a high level of knowledge and strategic financial transactions to the company. We're thrilled to add these individuals to the outstanding group of leaders on our Board, and we look forward to their counsel and contributions to our company. Now I will turn the call over to Jerry to provide an overview of the strong quarter just completed. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thanks, John. And good morning, everybody. As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand. For those who have followed us over the years, you may recall that Orkin was acquired by Rollins in 1964 and as the original company that first started our venture into pest control. Today, Orkin remains our largest brand, employing over 8,000 team members and completing millions of services annually worldwide. Orkin is very involved in the communities they serve, maintaining a strong commitment to education, public health and environmental responsibility. From collaborations with the centers for disease control and prevention and major universities to their work with the National Science Teachers Association, Orkin fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world around us. As we have previously shared with you over the past few years, Orkin has adopted new technologies, which has improved communications with customers, optimized routing and scheduling and increased technician efficiencies to name a few. Through the years, Orkin has grown, adding both new customers and new customer service offerings like bed bug, flea and tick, mosquito and most recently, VitalClean, our service designed to fight COVID-19. Overall, Orkin has significantly contributed to the long-term success of Rollins. As Gary mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 15.3% to $63.2 million compared to $553.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Net income grew to $98.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $75.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 13.6% and termite 16.3% over second quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation delivered an impressive 17.4% growth over second quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 11.3% growth over 2 years ago when we weren't experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. As you may recall, last year, we thought it was prudent to forgo our annual price increase during the pandemic. Now encouraged by the economic recovery that's underway, we have rolled out our 2021 annual price increases at all our brands. Implemented at the end of the second quarter, we expect that we will see the benefits of these increases as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Additionally, we're especially pleased with our commercial pest control growth, which has not only benefited from the economy reopening, but also from our InSite commercial technology. Through the use of InSite, Orkin's web reporting tool, our commercial customers have the ability to monitor pest activity and treatments within their facilities, reduce service tickets and receive specific pest alert notifications. This allows for quality assurance checks to be easily completed at the customer level. It also gives the customer the ability to produce timely reporting as necessary for regulatory or third party audits. We get great feedback from customers on InSite and are confident that this feature will strengthen our relationships with commercial clients. Overall, we've made strong progress during the first six months of 2021. And as we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and profitability in our business. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials. Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would like to recognize that the significant financial gains from this quarter are on top of the strong gains that we experienced during 2020. Even as we were all entering a different economic time back in Q2 of last year, our revenue grew at a steady 5.6%. That was converted into net income growth of 17.2%. Both of these 2020 numbers were at or above our historic averages. So for the second quarter 2021, as Jerry noted, all business lines presented strong revenue growth. Keys to the quarter included pricing strength, positively impacting revenue growth, continued mosquito service revenue improvement over 30% and commercial pest control revenue improving significantly. Additionally, for the first time, our mosquito service revenue has surpassed our bedbug revenue in this quarter was over 3% of our total revenue. Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $638.2 million was an increase of 15.3% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $553.3 million. Our income before income taxes was $133.9 million, or 29.4% above 2020. Our net income was $98.9 million, up 31.2% compared to 2020. Our earnings per share were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in 2020, or a 33.3% increase. As a reminder, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP results were positively impacted by our gain on sales of several of our properties. For the first six months of 2021, revenues were $1.174 billion, which was an increase of 12.7% over the prior year's first six months revenue of $1.014 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $253.8 million or 59.7% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $191.5 million or 61.4%, compared to 2020. Our GAAP EPS or earnings per were $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in 2020. Overall, like some companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, demand in most areas of our business in both 2020 and 2021 was strong. We maintained consistent revenue growth of 5.6% in 2020, followed by a healthy increase of 15.3% in 2021. It does not seem that pent up demand or stimulus checks have impacted our residential revenue growth, but rather a new awareness of pest needs based on more time spent at the home. It would be difficult to predict what these new demand levels will look like in the future, but we remain optimistic. Our total revenue increased for the quarter, up 15.3% and included 1.7% from significant acquisitions with the remaining 13.6% from pricing and new customer growth. Residential pest control made up 40% of our revenue; commercial pest control, 33%; and termite and other services made up approximately 21% of our revenue. In addition, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue less significant acquisitions, was up 13.6%. From that, residential was up 12.3%; commercial, excluding fumigation, increased 14.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 14.9%. In total, our gross margin decreased to 53.3% from 53.8% in the prior year's quarter. Improvements were made in total payroll but were negatively offset by higher overall fleet costs and a write-down of inventory of $2.7 million related to our PPE, or personal protective equipment. We will continue to assess our fluctuating future needs and market value for our PPE in the coming quarters. In addition to our continued Orkin US mileage savings, our Orkin Canada and Western Pest brands are making progress regarding their BOSS and routing and scheduling implementation. Each company has improved their on-day and on-time delivery since the project started. These savings will help support improvements in our overall fleet cost in the future quarters. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.4 million to $23.3 million, an increase of 6.3%. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.3 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Service in December 2020 and Adams Pest in Australia in July of last year. Sales, general and administrative expenses presented a 7.1% improvement for the quarter over 2020, decreasing from 30.9% of revenues to 28.7% of revenues in 2021. The quarter produced savings in administrative and sales salaries and benefits, as well as telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. As for our cash position, for the six months ending 6/30/2021, we spent $28.4 million on acquisitions compared to $56 million in the same period last year. We paid $79.7 million on dividends and had $13.2 million of CapEx compared to $12.4 million in 2020. We ended the period with $128.5 million in cash, of which $73.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close out, I would like to mention our recent press release, where Rollins was named to the top 50 green fleet list as pushed by Automotive Fleets 2021 ranking. As part of our continuous improvement that I mentioned in my opening, we have lots of opportunity in the future in this area, but we are proud of this recognition by the industry. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10th, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 10th, 2021. Gary, I'll turn it back to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. And we're happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed. Tim Mulrooney : Gary, John, Jerry, Julie, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Gary Rollins : Good morning. John Wilson : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : So just a real quick housekeeping here. On the residential pest, can you give us those numbers again for total residential pest growth and organic? I think I missed that. Julie Bimmerman : Okay. Gary Rollins : Yes. You got that Julie? Julie Bimmerman : Yes. Let me get that for you real quick, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. While you're looking that up, Julie, I'll just ask this next question to the broader group. This is my follow-up question. Last year, around this time, you guys highlighted the record level of new account sales, I think, particularly in residential. And I think that you had many all time record high new sales days throughout the quarter. Can you talk about how new account sales have trended through the second quarter of this year, now a year later? And how that compares to the really strong period that you had during the second quarter of last year? Thank you. John Wilson : So Tim, this is John Wilson. I'll take a stab at that. Our brand that we best track and that is, of course, Orkin being our largest. And for the second quarter, that continued to be up again this year. But of course, not by near the \u2013 near the same record number, but we are improved over a year ago in new customer accounts. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Okay. Thanks very much. And Julie, were you able to get the residential organic growth and total growth? Julie Bimmerman : Okay. Yes. So we're talking about the total growth and that may have [indiscernible] We actually had Jerry talk about the total, then I did talk about the organic, so from that standpoint. So for the quarter, we experienced the growth in residential increasing to 13.6%, the termite 16.3% and the commercial, excluding fume of 17.4%. You're listening? Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Got it. I'm with you. Julie Bimmerman : Okay. I just wanted to make sure. And then - not a problem, not a problem. Just bear with me, Tim. This is new for me. And then talking on the organic side for the residential was the 12.3%, commercial, excluding fume 14.8%, and termite at the 14.9%. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, Julie. Thank you everybody\u2026 Julie Bimmerman : Yes. Thanks, Tim. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed. Mario Cortellacci : Hi. Thank you for the time. I guess maybe just asking Tim's question a slightly different way. I guess how much of your organic growth - or maybe you can help us understand the organic growth build-up this quarter of how much was new customers, how much was cross-sell or new products introduced to existing customers? Was there any improvement on retention that contributed to organic growth as well? And then it sounds like you turned pricing back on, was that still in like the 1% to 2% range for the quarter as well? Julie Bimmerman : Okay. I will start on this and then anyone else, if you want to jump in feel free. First of all, on the pricing, we put in our normal price increase that we normally would have. So we did not do something additional because we held the price increase last year. So it would be within the normal ranges in answer to that. As to our retention rate, we have seen a consistent incremental growth on our retention over the last 5 years and still do see that trend continuing this year. John Wilson : Yes. So I'll add on to that, Mario. This is John Wilson. Pricing amounted to about 1.2%, which is kind of in line with our historic norm of what pricing adds. And the real answer to your question is all of the above. So cross selling had a piece of that, we don't track what that may add. So I don't - I can't give you a number on that. Retention improved, as Julie mentioned. And then, of course, we did have an increase, again, as I mentioned a minute ago with Tim, on our new accounts added. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. Thank you. And then just, I guess, a follow-up on the pricing and maybe whatever inflation that could potentially show up. I have been following you guys as long as some other guys. But I don't know maybe what you've done historically in higher inflation environment. If we do see inflation or wage and labor inflation kind of rear its ugly head for you, would you go above that range, that historical 1% to 2% range, like you did 1.2% this quarter. If you're seeing wages really ramp a lot higher, you're finding it a lot harder to find talent over the following - over the next year, would you kind of flex that pricing up a little higher to offset the increased costs? John Wilson : Yes. So we could. I mean, the market will, obviously, dictate what we can do. But we've always pointed to our call center that we have is a wonderful laboratory to test what our pricing elasticity is with our various close rates and what we're capable of getting there. So we would absolutely look at that, Mario. Right now, we don't feel a need to, but we'll take a look at it. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. And then just a quick housekeeping, and maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, did you guys disclose or say how many deals you closed in Q2 or year-to-date so far? John Wilson : I don't know that number. Julie Bimmerman : We just gave you the dollars on that. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Julie Bimmerman : Thanks, Mario. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much. And since the others have focused more on sales, I'm going to focus on cost. So there's a little giveback in gross margin, but a meaningful improvement in SG&A. And on the gross margin, I'm trying to understand, is there not wage inflation as well versus - or is that embedded in fleet? And then on the SG&A, can you sustain less than 29% of revs from this point forward, given where you are? Julie Bimmerman : Hey, Michael. So within the gross margin, we did - I mean, we actually did see an improvement in our total payroll in answer to that. So overall, you've got to remember that technicians are directly tied with the work that they're producing. So their wages are tied to - at the - when they go through and complete their jobs, if you recall on that front. As far as the fleet cost, the fleet cost, yes, as you know, we did have an increase in that, and that was improved predominantly within the fuel [ph]. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then the G&A? Julie Bimmerman : On the G&A side, as you said, though, we definitely saw some SG&A improvements over the same quarter last year. And it was really administrative in sales salaries, and then also with our new contracts for our telephone that we were able to work on some better pricing. Jerry Gahlhoff : This is Jerry, Michael. The other thing I would say is we've been very careful about adding costs back into our business over the past year. We made some changes in our business a year ago. And from an operations standpoint, we've been very careful about what we're adding back in terms of our cost structure. So - and a lot of that has to do with our - controlling our overhead expenses. Gary Rollins : Well, on revenue and schedule, and this is Gary. Certainly, has given us an opportunity to get more done. And as Julie said, the vast majority of our pest control technicians are on a productivity pay plan. So as they do more, they make more and that helps with turnover reduction. So all those elements are coming together fortunately. Michael Hoffman : Terrific. And then my follow-up, you released a supplemental 8-K after the earnings release and made reference to an SEC investigation. Have they completed that because they never tell you when they're completing it? So can you tell us if they completed it? John Wilson : Yes. Michael. So I think the 8-K referred is that it's ongoing, and it is ongoing. It is not completed, no. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thank you very much. Julie Bimmerman : Thank you. Operator : We have reached - we do have a follow-up question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed. Tim Mulrooney : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask about your virus side spend term [ph] because this is a topic across my services coverage universe. I know virus side spend has been elevated across your customer base, as folks are still highly sensitive to the issues of hygiene in virus protection. But with vaccination rates on the rise, I would assume that this offering would moderate over time. So am I right about that? Can you talk a little bit about demand for your virus side offering and how that's trending? Jerry Gahlhoff : My best. This is Jerry, Tim. My best barometer [ph] that is talking to Freeman Elliott at Orkin. And while we have seen it moderate, I think that's the right term. There is also places where there is demand, still where people are coming back to office spaces and people are still concerned about their workers being in there and want that kind of disinfection service still occurring. So it's still there. Some markets are better than others where they've returned more people to the offices and things like that. So it's still a viable business, although, to your point, it has moderated. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. And while you got me here, maybe I'll try to squeeze one more in, but thanks for the color on that, Jerry. I wanted to ask about your M&A pipeline, and this is like big picture. So how would you say your pipeline looks today compared to say 5 years ago? Is it smaller given how much consolidation we've seen over the last 5 years? Or is it the other way? Is it larger because more pest control companies are emerging every day? Really curious how you all would characterize the M&A pipeline relative to 5, 10 years ago? John Wilson : Yes, Tim, so this is John. I'll take a stab at that at the start and maybe Jerry can add to it. I've used the word frothy in the past, and I think it's still that way. Our pipeline is - I would - I don't have that number from 5 years ago, but I would guess it's similar. And a big driver of late has been contemplated tax changes coming out of Washington, D.C., whether it's to you know, state taxes or whatever. And so some of that's driving some of the conversations that we've had. So Jerry, if you have anything to add to that? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We're still seeing plenty of deals looking at things and evaluating what makes sense to us at an appropriate price. So we still have plenty of action going on there. Julie Bimmerman : Okay. And let me jump on to that real quick, and this actually goes back to, I think, it was Mario's question. We have closed 18 deals through the end of Q2. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color, everybody\u2026 Julie Bimmerman : And I do want to throw one other thing out there. Jerry just put a note in front of me. It sounds like when I said that residential pest control made up, I believe, I said 40% of our revenues, that is incorrect. It is 46% of our revenue. So\u2026 Jerry Gahlhoff : I can't believe you're understating it. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. And look forward to reporting in October, our third quarter results and updating you on our progress. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

John Wilson : Thank you, Julie. Before we begin, I am sure you have noticed that Gary is not on today's conference call. He is actively rehabbing from a knee replacement operation. And while he is recovering quickly, he is doing very well. He's just not in a position to physically join us today. We wish Gary well with his physical therapy and look forward to having him rejoin us on future calls. During the third quarter, we achieved some very strong business results, and Jerry will go over those with you shortly. In the interim, I wanted to share news of the latest addition to our Rollins Board of Directors. As you already know, over the previous year, we have enhanced and diversified that group with several new members. I am very pleased to announce our latest addition is Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Gahlhoff. This is in recognition of his strong leadership and his deep commitment to the company's long-term success. We are proud to have Jerry serving on our Board moving forward. Jerry is an important part of the Rollins leadership team, and his in-depth knowledge of our business and experience gained from working in our industry since 1991 adds perspective. We're fortunate to have him assume a greater role in the direction and future of our company. Before turning the call over to Jerry, I have 2 items to first update you on. The first will represent a recent development in Rollins' environmental, social and governance commitment. We take very seriously the responsibility that we have to the communities in which we work and live. As a recent example, we're pleased to share that Rollins has made an in-kind donation originally costing $4.6 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, items during the third quarter. Working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and several philanthropic organizations, including the Friends of Disabled Adults and Children, the Foundation of Hope Food Bank as well as Cope Preparedness in Los Angeles, we donated 27 pallets or 6.8 million pieces of masks, gloves and other items. In addition to achieving the successful execution of our strategies as well as solid business results, we also have a responsibility to the communities in which we work and live. EFC is a facet of our business is becoming more and more important to us. We are proud to support these initiatives. Last, as we have previously disclosed, the company has been responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with accounting standard ASC 450, we have established a reserve related to this matter, which we consider immaterial. Given that the investigation is ongoing, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we remain focused on resolving this inquiry. With that, I will turn our call over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $79.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. Revenues for the first 9 months of 2021 were $1.824 billion, an increase of 12.2% compared to $1.625 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased 44% to $285.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $198.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 11.7% and termite presenting 15% growth over the third quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 10.1% growth over the third quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 7.9% growth over 2 years ago when we were not experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. Rollins remains well positioned for the remainder of the year and into 2022 Looking deeper at our operating results, we're attracting customers to all our services and brands. And one area I'd like to focus on today is our continued strong growth in our wildlife service offerings. Trutech Wildlife joined the Rollins family in 2010, followed by Critter Control in 2015. Since 2010, the business has grown 800%. Day-to-day operations of operating a wildlife control business is quite different than running a typical pest and termite business, and we are proud to have a dedicated team focused on this much needed service. Originally concentrated in the Southeastern United States, the business has expanded across the nation as well as into Canada. And with Critter Control's expansion into Canada, it's Rollins' first brand to enter an international country without acquiring another business as a platform. The Wildlife division also operates a thriving franchise system. There are currently 84 franchises with the most recent franchise launching in Mansfield, Ohio. We anticipate finishing the year with 12 new franchises, one of our strongest years in adding franchisees. We have also been fortunate to add 9 former corporate employees as franchisees, employees who have an entrepreneurial drive and a passion for wildlife and customer service have multiple career path opportunities, be it ownership of the franchise or growth within our company. We believe there is meaningful opportunity for continued growth in our Wildlife business and look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead. I'd now like to discuss Hurricane Ida. Our hearts go out to our Gulf Coast region and those that were affected by the hurricane. But I must admit we are inspired by our team in that area. They implemented an amazing plan that helped our team members and alleviate the negative impact of the storm. I have shut down several of our branches for days, but 2 locations were shut down for about 2 weeks. The impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business in the quarter. Thankfully, all of our employees in the area were safe, yet they did need assistance. Through the Rollins Employee Relief Fund, we granted 137 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first week following the hurricane to enable employees to address their personal essential needs. Since then, another 7 employees who endured greater hardships received full grants to address their more significant needs. Additionally, our Orkin South Central division, led by Leland Morris, quickly initiated a preparedness and mitigation plan to assist our team members. This included immediate procurement of much needed supplies for our employees and their families, such as generators, fuel, portable air conditioners, fans, water and other essential emergency provisions that were not readily accessible to them locally. Our team members in adjacent areas that were fortunate to avoid the brunt of Ida's force volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours, to load these supplies into box trucks and drive them to those most in need. For weeks, they continue to shuttle fuel to these employees to keep their generators up and running. This was a total team effort, and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to one another. In fact, we're so pleased with their effort that we plan to expand and formalize this program in other areas of the country so that we can rapidly respond in case of a natural disaster or emergency. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials. Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarterly moving forward. The first is a measure we have referred to periodically and that is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Due to our consistent high volume of acquisitions and hence, high amortization expense related to these acquisitions, presenting EBITDA regularly will provide a clearer picture of our operation's ongoing financial performance. Think about this, over the last 3 years, we have averaged 30 acquisitions per year. Next, we will begin presenting our revenue growth through both constant exchange rate and actual exchange rate. By utilizing historical baseline revenues for acquisitions betted through the due diligence process, we were able to include all acquisitions within the calculations, both stand-alone and tuck-in. This will bring clarity and consistency to both our acquisition and our organic revenue growth measurements. Third, we'll be providing you with our free cash flow. We believe that this will properly illustrate Rollins' strong ability to generate cash. We have taken a simple approach to defining free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of equipment and property. Our hope is that these measurements will enable investors to better assess our operating performance in the future and provide a deeper view of our business. We have included GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on each of these metrics on our earnings press release published this morning. So on to the numbers. Our third quarter revenues of $650.2 million was an increase of 11.4% over last year. Of the 11.4% actual exchange rate revenue growth, acquisition growth was 2.2% and organic equated to 9.2%. For the constant exchange rate, the growth percentages calculated within the hundreds of the actual exchange growth rate, therefore, presented the same. For the 9 months ended September 2021, revenues of $1.824 billion was an increase of 12.12 percentage over year-to-date 2020. Of this actual exchange rate, total revenue growth of 2 -- or excuse me, of 12.2%, 2.7% was related to acquisitions and 9.5% organic growth. The constant year-to-date exchange rate total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.6%, 2.7% represented acquisitions and 8.9% organic revenue growth. As Jerry pointed out, residential, commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. So in determining my focus for today, I decided to take Jerry's lead and discuss Wildlife, yet I'm discussing specifically company-owned Wildlife operations. For the third quarter in 2021, Wildlife revenues grew 24.1% over last year. And year-to-date, Wildlife has presented an overall revenue growth of 27.6%. What makes this particularly impressive is that this is after their strong growth of 20.4% last year. So similar to our residential pest control, Wildlife did not feel a negative impact to revenue growth during the pandemic. So way to go to the Wildlife team. Now on to our income. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the onetime super busting of our late Chairman stock grant in the third quarter of 2020 and the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first 6 months of 2021. The third quarter 2021 EBITDA was $150.9 million or 8.7% over 2020 third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $138.9 million. Third quarter 2021 EPS was $0.19 per diluted share or 5.6% improvement over the 2020 third quarter adjusted EPS. For the 9 months ended September 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $421.2 million or 22.1% over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $344.9 million. Year-to-date, 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share or 26.2% over last year. For the third quarter 2021, gross margin increased to 53% or 0.4% over last year. Strong improvements in our materials and supplies were negatively offset by high overall fleet costs, primarily from an increase in fuel of approximately $4 million over third quarter 2020 and lower vehicle gains of $900,000 compared to last year. Sales, general and administrative third quarter margin increase over last year was strongly impacted by the PPE donations and the SEC accrual previously mentioned by John. Travel expenses have also increased $1.3 million in the third quarter as we have begun to lift our company travel restrictions. Amortization expenses for the third quarter 2021 increased $1.4 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from multiple acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation of $201,000 due to the sale of owned vehicles and centralizing of IT function. Overall, this equated to a 5.1% increase in depreciation and amortization over the third quarter 2020. Our dividends paid year-to-date 2021 was $119.7 million or an increase of 30.4% over last year. We ended the current period with $117.7 million in cash, of which $73.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. So this brings us to the final of our new 3 measurements, free cash flow. For the third quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $72.9 million or a decrease of 27.5% over the same quarter last year. For the 9 months ended 2021, our free cash flow equals $278.9 million or 13.6% decrease over year-to-date 2020. This fluctuation occurred due to the deferral of $30.3 million in FICA taxes payable in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act. These associated taxes were then remitted in September of 2021. We hope that the discussion of these new measurements, you will receive a greater clarity while reviewing our financial performance. Lastly, I want to discuss that yesterday, we were extremely pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 25% increase to our dividend. The quarterly dividend increased $0.10 -- to $0.10 per share from $0.08 per share and will be paid on December 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2021. Additionally, the Board also approved a special dividend of $0.08 to be paid on December 10, 2021, as well. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and underscores our financial strength, our solid capital position and the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. John, I'll turn it back to you. John Wilson : Thank you, Julie. We are happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : John, Jerry and Julie, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and sending my best to Gary on a quick recovery. So yes, just 2 questions for me. The first one, Julie, I apologize if I missed it, but did you give organic growth by segments in the prepared remarks? Julie Bimmerman : No, we did not. We just gave the organic on the overall. Tim Mulrooney : Is it a change in policy for the company now that you won't be providing that? That's been pretty critical in terms of us understanding how the company is performing. Julie Bimmerman : At this point, with our change, we're trying to give you additional clarity by giving a very clean organic and the acquisition growth numbers. So we will be staying for here for now. Tim Mulrooney : And I did want to confirm that because I know that's been an area of focus. The organic number this quarter excludes all acquisitions, both large and bolt-on? Julie Bimmerman : Yes, 100%. All acquisitions are excluded. Tim Mulrooney : My next question is on margins. EBITDA margin contracted, I think, about 60 basis points year-over-year and 140 basis points sequentially. Can you talk about the primary factors that caused that 140 basis point contraction from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year? I have to imagine that it's probably labor related because I don't think materials and supplies are a large enough component of your COGS to really cause us much of a headwind. But I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Julie Bimmerman : I'm going to go ahead and kick this first to Jerry, and then I'll see if I want to add anything on to that. Jerry Gahlhoff : The biggest headwind we had, Tim, this is Jerry, in the quarter, was fuel prices. Fuel expense was up significantly. We were able to manage the labor part pretty well. From -- as a percentage of revenue, labor wasn't as big of a deal. So we just had higher fleet expenses probably more than anything. John, what would you add to that? Anything? John Wilson : Yes. I would second the labor part. I mean our labor as increase a percentage of revenue was -- one of the ways we track it, Tim, is our expenses growing less fast than our revenue, and that's always a focus for our operations. And labor was -- grew less than that 11% revenue increase. Tim Mulrooney : No, that's really good color. I appreciate that. Can you remind me what percent of your sales typically fuel represents? Julie Bimmerman : Well, we don't break out the fuel specifically. We keep that buried into our fleet number as you well know. So also think about it's not only the fuel increasing, as you said, the $4 million. But we're also talking about the increase because we had fewer vehicle gains this quarter as well, just under $1 million on that as well. John Wilson : I think in our prepared remarks, Julie said $4 million in increased fuel cost, Tim. And as you know, we've had active routing and scheduling efforts for several years. With 1 million stops per month or more, without that effort and the reduced miles per stop that our field teams are achieving, it would have been worse. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mario Cortellacci : Just kind of piggybacking off of the margin part of it. Maybe you can just give us a sense for how pricing is running right now. I think last quarter, you guys said that you could flex it up above the 1% to 2% historical range to help offset some of the cost pressures. But is there any lag in there, like the fuel side of the equation? The receivable? Or the fleet side of the equation? Or is the pricing running hot and just helping offset maybe some of the labor pressures? John Wilson : So you broke up a little bit on part of that. We've not taken any real extraordinary pricing action as a whole. As we talked about previously, many of our -- the vast majority of our people are paid on a productivity pay plan. So any sort of impact to wage inflation doesn't really reflect. What we do, do is use our call center team and our close rates and our branches to sort of evaluate do we have room in pricing. And then that's been a sort of effort that we've always looked at. But if our close rates in a particular market are trending well above the norm, then that tells us we have room for pricing increasing, no matter that the economic or concerns that are going on, right? And conversely, if it goes the other way, we have the same -- then we would take maybe a different action. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. The call center has a lot of ability to look at data real time and make those adjustments to what they're selling, how they're selling it, what the demand is like and adjusting price based on that. But we also did implement our annual price increase this summer just as our core price increase that helps offset some of those costs. But certainly, the fuel is certainly the most impacted component of that this past quarter. Mario Cortellacci : And then just more of a housekeeping issue. I guess with the new organic growth disclosure, are you guys going to provide any historical so that we have some context in how things have trended? Or -- and then also, I guess, within the quarter, can you give us any context within how ready and commercial trended relative to the corporate average? Was resi slowing, commercial slowing? Is it continuing to pick up or commercial accelerating? Just any kind of context there would be helpful. Julie Bimmerman : Well, basically, it's what we're getting down to the new numbers. We're going to -- we put these new measurements in place from this point on and will be going forward. So as of today, we told you how this growth relates to, obviously, Q3 of last year, so we gave you from that perspective. But we are not planning at this point to go back and give historical numbers. So hopefully, that makes sense from that standpoint. Mario Cortellacci : And then can you help with the resi and commercial trend within the quarter just so that we can gauge how each is performing? Jerry Gahlhoff : I would say -- this is Jerry. Residential remains strong. I mean it's been real consistent all the way from the pandemic to now, it remains strong. The commercial function appears to have completely rebounded and, again, is doing well. I would probably see some acceleration on the termite side. And so there's really a lot of positive things going on in our termite and ancillary services across the board. And that's been probably a more important growth driver for us in the third quarter. But all are really strong and continue to trend in positive direction. Operator : Next question comes from Ashish Sabra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ashish Sabra : Just a follow-up on the resi side. I was wondering if you can talk about the sales momentum coming out of the key summer selling season. And maybe a related question is also on the retention side, how retention has been tracking, particularly again on the resi side with -- like as people relocating post summer as well as return to office? Julie Bimmerman : I'll jump in and then you can add anything if you want to. So on the residential side, still very strong. As we said, we were sitting there with an 11.7% increase over Q3 of last year. And just to bring you around that, if you think about it, last summer, we still had a 10.5% increase on our resi. So residential was -- we did not see a decline last year like many businesses did or like we did on our commercial side. So the level -- that double-digit increase was on top of the double-digit increase last year. So from that standpoint, it is still running very strong. On the -- we have not seen any strong fluctuations on our retention this quarter. Is there anything else, John or Jerry, you would like to add to that? John Wilson : No. Frankly, Ashish, I've been a little bit surprised and pleased in our team's ability to handle the load that we've put on them with the new customer influx over the summer and the increasing customers that we added over this last year. Our 2 primary measurements are customer sat for the near term or the medium term. And then our customer retention is more of a lagging indicator. And both have remained relatively steady. Ashish Sabra : That's very helpful color and good to hear that. Maybe if I can just ask a question on the technology rollout. I was wondering if you could provide an update on how the Phase 1 and 2 are progressing and as well as the timing of the launch for Phase 3 and 4. John Wilson : Do you want to handle that? Jerry Gahlhoff : I can. This is Jerry. So we are very heavily focused on adoption in the field of the phases that we're in and different operations in the field or different phases of -- or different, I guess, maturity levels of adoption. John often describes it like a baseball game and what inning we're in. And we're still -- there's still an awful lot of upside there for us to drive utilization. And with this increase that we're seeing in fuel, there's a lot more desire to get that done and increase the adoption along the way. So we still have plenty of runway in that regard to doing that. And we're continuing to see incremental improvements. And that's what we're all about is continuous improvement and getting better all the time. But we still have a long way to go. Julie Bimmerman : And I'll just back to John's analogy that Jerry referenced to on the baseball is we said that we're still in the early sides of the game, early Jerry Gahlhoff : The early sides of the game? Julie Bimmerman : Sorry, the early innings, early innings. Jerry Gahlhoff : They must think we're playing football. Julie Bimmerman : Well, okay. Jerry Gahlhoff : Just an inning. It's okay. John Wilson : Yes, well John Wilson : Go ahead. Ashish Sabra : Sorry, go ahead. John Wilson : What I might add to that, our field leaders have adopted a sort of a mantra of, \"You bought it, now utilize it.\" So we've got a ton of technology that our IT team has done a great job in delivering to our end users. And we're really kind of pushing the mindset if you bought it, you're paying for it, now let's use it. And so that's what we're really working on in 2021. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael Hoffman : John and Jerry, Julie, and to pass on my best to Gary, rehab is challenging. On the organic growth, can you help us understand what's in it then? As you think about -- if you took [9.2%] and so it\u2019s approximately excess new customers, excess price, excess cross-selling? Julie Bimmerman : It's very similar to what it was in the past. So I think just on very broad average, 1% to 2% would be the price increase. And then we do say the rest is a combination of new customers with additional sales to existing customers. We don't break out that part, but just take out your price increase. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then on price, you've historically had a fuel surcharge, if I remember correctly. So are you John Wilson : Michael, this is John. We've never added a fuel surcharge. Well, I said never. We may have at one time and found out that it really takes our customers off -- And so then what do you do when it goes down and you have to get that back. So I shouldn't say never. But we may have one time, but we found out really quickly how that made our customers feel. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Then I stand corrected. And so how are you going to offset this inflation then? John Wilson : The inflation of fuel, additional fuel? Michael Hoffman : Yes, the fleet cost. The fleet cost pressure, how are you going to offset it? John Wilson : Well, we'll keep pursuing the same mission we have with reducing miles were stop. And rounding our people more efficiently and as we add new customers then we of course improve gently. Julie Bimmerman : Yes. I was just going to expand on what John said. It just gets back to what we were talking about a few minutes ago is, literally, I mean, think about it, if we are in the early innings, did I say that correctly guys, early innings on the on our routing and scheduling and what we can bring in and lowering those miles per stop, I mean, we have a long -- now I'm going to change analogies here, I won't say a long runway, that would totally kill it with it. We have a long way to go on that. So this will definitely help offset, as John was saying, the fuel increases. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then lastly, where does Wildlife exist in the 3 line items, just so we understand what it's influencing. Julie Bimmerman : It will be in whichever line item it occurs. The majority of the Wildlife would be on the residential. Jerry Gahlhoff : Right. But if it was a commercial customer that needed that service, say, a grocery store, it would hit commercial. But if it was a residential homeowner, it would hit residential. Julie Bimmerman : I'm just very familiar with it because I've used our Wildlife service before, flying squirrel. Jerry Gahlhoff : So it's going to -- it would be a mix of those. But the majority of their business is certainly residential. Julie Bimmerman : Michael, I just want to make one comment just so you know. That is the way we have always presented the Wildlife. So that is nothing new on how we do split that. Michael Hoffman : Fair enough. Just needed to understand since you were emphasizing it, which part was being influenced by it. Operator : Okay. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments. John Wilson : Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better as well as improve our customers' experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update on our fourth quarter and year-end call. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Julie Bimmerman : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. John Wilson : Thank you, Julie. First of all, I regret missing last quarter's call discussion. Nonetheless, my knee replacement therapy has been going well and it's great to be on the call with you this morning. I'm pleased to report that we experienced a very successful year, both financially and operationally, especially with our revenue and EPS growth. As we began 2022, we believe that Rollins is poised to deliver on our short term and long term objectives. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the New Year unfolds. As we previously disclosed, the company is in discussion with the staff at the US Security and Exchange Commission to resolve our SEC investigation. During the fourth quarter, we increased the accrual related to this matter to $8 million for a potential settlement. Given that the investigation is ongoing and out of respect for the process, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we are focused on resolving this inquiry in the very near future. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some of our business updates. John? John Wilson : Thank you and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 performance and very proud of the hardworking men and women of our company that propelled us to achieve record levels of revenue growth across each of our brands. I'm also pleased to note that we again realized a very strong performance in our termite service line, posting year-over-year double-digit growth of 14.3%. While our termite business has been growing by double-digit for several years in a row now, termite damage claims as well as any related litigation have declined year by year reaching our lowest level in recent history during 2021. To be more specific, termite damage claims received have declined from a high of 9,349 to the low of 380 new claims received this past year. While at the same time, revenue from termite has tripled. The genesis of this great story started with a serious commitment to address a problem that had been building for several years, obviously resolve a loan wouldn't clean up a problem that large. Success came from a series of changes initiated by our leadership team to our culture, our training, our treatment protocols and our quality assurance processes. We significantly improved and expanded training of our field service and sales team members and our managers made that training mandatory before you could be allowed to service our customers. We held hundreds of regional training meetings and a multitude of termite-specific training modules were developed. We revised our treatment protocols to solve situations we were experiencing due in part to evolving new construction practices in various markets. These revised treatment protocols in many cases, exceeded state treating requirements. Additionally, we created a nationwide quality assurance team that took control of the claims process requiring our branch offices to report each claim immediately. This insured a quick response to our customers when most needed. This QA group also went to the field and inspected our team's work and verified that things were being done according to our new treating requirements. Finally, and maybe most important, the most difficult change was to our culture. As an example, any location, failing quality assurance team inspections had to make a trip to visit the division president of the company. Those that failed to adjust and adhere to the new practices by the time a follow up QA visit occurred, didn't receive a return trip. Change came quickly due to those practices. Fast forward to today and all our newly acquired companies are brought under these standards as quickly as possible. We believe these service level commitments are important to meet or exceed the expectations our customers have for us. Operationally, our service offering is led by a very strong and dedicated termite services group and a very experienced technical service team. I'm proud to work for a company that has made these commitments to protect our customers, our brands, and our reputation. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I'm going to focus on items that directly impacted our operations in the fourth quarter and then Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments, most notably the SEC accrual that impacted the year. 2021 was a strong and productive year for Rollins' family of pest control brands. Q4 revenues increased 11.9% to $600.3 million compared to $536.3 million the previous year. Net income rose to $65.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Our revenues for the full year were $2.424 billion, an increase of 12% compared to $2.161 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the full year increased 34.5% to $350.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Julie will review our full year GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. All our business lines experienced solid growth with residential pest control up 11.9% and termite realizing growth of 13.6%. Additionally, commercial pest control delivered an impressive 11.4% growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Julie will give you a more detailed breakdown on organic revenue growth by service line in a few moments. Before I move on from revenue and address expenses, I want to emphasize how proud we are of the growth rates we achieved in the fourth quarter and for the year. During the year coincidentally, Orkin reached their 120 anniversary and celebrated by putting up one of their best performances in years. All our brands grew and contributed greatly to our operating results. On the expense side, payroll, materials and supplies and fleet are three largest expense areas and I'll give you some additional color on how each of these items impacted margin in Q4. Let's start with labor. Remarkably, we've been able to achieve above average revenue growth rates while keeping our service payroll expense margins below last year in Q4. On a year to date basis, that expense margin is flat to 2020. Our administrative payroll margins also improved over 2020 as we continue to improve productivity. However, we did experience a slight increase in our sales payroll margin. The sales payroll expense trend is reflective of the planned investment we made in upstaffing our residential and commercial sales teams over the last 12 months. This investment yielded the high levels of growth I mentioned a few minutes ago. If there's an area I do not mind giving up margin to, it's sales payroll so long as we are growing revenue faster than the sales payroll expense. I'm proud of our team's ability to manage payroll expense despite recruiting challenges caused by labor shortages. Last week, we held our virtual will Rollins leadership meeting with over 175 of our top leaders. Most of our topics were about best practices in recruiting and retaining our people. This is a huge focus item for us in 2022. Let's move to materials and supplies costs, or M&S. Our M&S cost were a slight headwind in the quarter, particularly for our termite and ancillary service offerings where we've had more supply chain issues in the latter part of the year. Our, procurement team is working hard in this area by seeking alternate products while our operations team has analyzed the impact of these increases in adjusting our rate card pricing upward, where needed to counteract the rise in materials cost. Probably most impactful to us in Q4 is fleet expense, particularly fuel. Compared to Q4 of 2020 our fuel cost were up 56.5% in Q4 of 2021. That equated to over $4.5 million in increased fuel costs for the quarter. In addition, increases in fleet repair costs for items like tires and basic maintenance, also rose double digits. As we've discussed in the past, we're making significant progress with our BOSS operating systems routing and scheduling technologies, which help us mitigate some of these fuel cost increases. Since reducing miles driven between services saves not only fuel, but also time. This technology contributed in an either even bigger way to helping us manage our service payroll expense by enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner. We began to feel the first significant impacts of the fuel increases in Q2 of 2021. So we anticipate that fleet costs will continue to be a significant headwind for us in the first quarter of this year. Related to expenses is one other item I'd like to mention. Most are familiar with the cybersecurity attacks experience by solar winds and colonial pipeline and others that recently put a spotlight on cybersecurity threats. Due to concerns about these types of cybersecurity issues, in Q4, we fast tracked our multiyear strategy to enhance our protections against cybersecurity threats by accelerating a $3 million expenditure. We have a dedicated cyber team implementing enhanced cybersecurity controls for domestic and international operations to protect our employees, our customers and our brands. Shifting briefly to the acquisition landscape, we continue to successfully execute our acquisition strategy of identifying and acquiring high quality companies with shared culture and values. Last year ended strong with over 70% of our trailing 12 months revenue acquired occurring in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands and looking ahead, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie? Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, Jerry. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics. As we previously discussed in our third quarter conference calls, we assess the performance metrics we report to ensure they best articulate Rollins' business. To that end, we discuss several additional measure measurements we present each quarter, including EBITDA, free cash and total organic revenue growth. In addition, we're now including organic revenue growth by revenue type, specifically residential, commercial and termite. We believe this will bring further transparency to our revenue growth measurements. Also, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discuss within the earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. We realized we are going over a lot of information today and believe this will give you a resource to review what everything that we have covered. So now on to the numbers, our fourth quarter revenues of $600 million was an increase of 11.9% actual exchange rate growth, 8.9% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth percentage is calculated to 11% with an 8.1% organic. For the full year 2021, revenues of $2.4 billion with an increase of 12.2% over full year 2020, 9.5% organic. The constant exchange rate, total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.4%, 8.7% organic. As mentioned previously, residential commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. What Jerry did not tell you was that all three also grew double digits for the full year 2021 over 2020. For the fourth quarter growth over last year, residential grew 11.9%, 8.4% organic. Commercial grew 11.4%, 9.3% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.6% with 10.1% organic. For the full year 2021 over 2020, residential grew 12.9%, 10% organic, commercial grew 10.2%, 7.4% organic and we closed that with termite at 14.3% growth, 11.9% organic. Now to our income, for the fourth quarter and year to date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the one time super vesting of our late chairman's stock grants in the third quarter of 2020. The impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first six months of 2021 and our recorded accrual related to the potential settlement of the SEC matter in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted 2021 EBITDA was $122.2 million or 11.2% over 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.14 per diluted share or 7.7% improvement over 2020. For the full year 2021, our adjusted EBITDA with $546.4 million or 20.1% over last year. Year to date 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.68 per diluted share or 25.9% over 2020. For fourth quarter 2021, gross margin increased 50.4% or one tenth of a point over last year. That was after overcoming our strong headwinds of fleet expenses, specifically fuel in the amount of 4.5 million and termite M&F for $2.7 million. Sales, general and administrative fourth quarter 2021 margins increased 1.6 over last year. This was driven by the increase in sales salaries mentioned by Jerry, along with the increased SEC accrual. Without these two items, our SG&A fourth quarter margin presented an improvement over fourth quarter 2020. Related to the SEC potential settlement, we recorded an accrual of $5 million in Q4. This was in addition to the $3 million we previously accrued in the third quarter. These amounts are not tax deductible for state or federal taxes. The company continues to cooperate with SEC and working towards a final resolution. During the year we completed significant remediation efforts including the addition of a chief accounting officer, SEC attorney and SEC external reporting director. Also, we reevaluated and strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting while improving processes, procedures and related supporting documentation, including those related to management's judgment and estimates. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow, our dividends full year 2021 for $208.7 million or an increase of 30% over 2020 while cash used for acquisitions declined 5.8% to $139 million for 2021. We ended the current period with a $105.3 in cash of which $78.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiary. As you've probably noted over time, our foreign cash held has increased with the exception of used for acquisitions. We're in the process of restructuring our foreign entities to make cash from foreign operations, more readily available. This should be completed later in 2022. Now to free cash flow, for the fourth quarter of 2021, our free cash was $88.9 million or a decrease of 0.8% over last year. The decline was due to a capital expenditure increase from upgrading our data center facility as part of our cybersecurity initiative. Full year free cash flow was $395 million or decrease of $41 million. This decline was primarily due to the $30 million 2020 Cares Act taxes paid in 2021 and a $32 million gain from the sale of the Clark properties, the latter of which is an operating cash reconciling item. Last, I am happy to share that yesterday our board of directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2022. This represents the 25% increase of the March 2021 regular cash dividend paid out. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in 2021 and that accentuates our financial strength, our solid capital position and the board's confidence and our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn it back to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : John. Thanks for that excellent history of your termite service. John Wilson : You're welcome. Tim Mulrooney : A couple questions on organic growth. So, the first one, on your commercial pests organic growth, it picked up in the fourth quarter, despite a more difficult comparison with last year. Can you talk a little bit more about your commercial pest business, what's maybe helping drive that acceleration? All else equal, we kind of expected your commercial business to continue to normalize back towards your historical range, but instead it picked up a little bit here. So just curious, what's going on? Jerry Gahlhoff : This is Jerry, Tim. A lot of the commercial sales growth is a result of the investment that we've made in the staffing. We saw an opportunity to capitalize on the rebound and we began upstaffing in that amongst our commercial sales team over a year ago during when things were still rough, we were investing in the business and getting people up to speed and ramped up so that we would be ready for the rebound and we've just basically been able to capitalize on that. John Wilson : Yeah, Tim, and this is John. I might add that our commercial sales success was driven by both categories. And when I say both, I mean, local sales efforts, that's our local branches with feed on the street, adding accounts, but also our national accounts and I'm going off of memory. So forgive me if I'm off a little bit, but our national account sales effort for December was up some 50% or close to it. That indicates a lot of business being let out forbid to start the new year. But we were up in that one little month for by 50%. So pretty pleased with that. Tim Mulrooney : That's really helpful color. Thanks guys. And I apologize for this next question, but there's a lot of numbers and perhaps misinformation being thrown around right now. So I just want to clarify. You guys revised your organic growth estimates. For the first half of 2021, you gave us that excellent table in your press release and you revised it to exclude all acquisitions, not just the significant acquisitions and by our math, it looks like the difference between the old definition of organic growth and the new definition is about 1% for the first half of 2021, the only periods in which we have both numbers. Is that also how you see it, that those bolt-ons added about one percentage point to revenue growth and do you think that that's a typical thing? Julie Bimmerman : I'd say that yes, I'd agree to your numbers and what you're saying on that front. A lot of it, as far as typical, it honestly depends on the, how many acquisitions are closing. When are they closing? What are the sizes of the acquisitions closing? So know it is not always, the 1% there's many times when it is lower. The only time when we see anything that would be high would be a large acquisition, like, Clark. John Wilson : Yeah, I would add that it, maybe it was typical for this year, Tim, but it's not always like that. So, we just -- we just never know. I think the benefit is -- kind of it with all extracted. Now it gives us a clearer picture. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mario Cortellacci : Hi. Really appreciate the time. I guess my question is just around your labor availability. And forgive me if I misheard it at the beginning of the call, but I know you added some color around maybe your completions, but maybe you can just talk to how the labor availability is impacting the business and how you guys are working through it. Is this just something where you're, you're obviously paying these people more, but maybe you can also talk about the impact, the higher wages for the service of the business could potentially have on 2022 margins? John Wilson : So Mario, let me take a stab at it first. And maybe Jerry will have something to add. So you'll recall in previous quarters as this was maybe a building issue. We talked about most of our pay plans are productivity driven. So the more work they produce, the more they earn. And so while we're certainly turning over more than our norm our people are still pretty well paid and we are getting the more placed. And so getting to the lion share of our work, we have very little of it that's fallen through the cracks. So no doubt, it's a tough environment. Our people, I've used the term turnover, a lot of rocks before our people are having to turn over a lot of rocks to find new people. But as we talked about in our leadership meeting, that Jerry referenced week, the best course of action is not to lose them in the first place, right? Keep them engaged, keep them happy and not lose them. And then you're not bearing that cost of replacing them. So we are seeing some inflation pressure on a few of our jobs, and most notably our termite service technicians, those are, are typically hourly and we've had to up our pay rates in some markets, but, but we're still getting people and we're getting to, to the line, share of our work. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would add as you look, as we look forward to 2022, we're really emphasizing to our managers about how much more time they need to spend on recruiting efforts as it's, if it may be that we have to spend as a hiring manager, you may have to spend two hours of your day, every day, focused on recruiting and hiring and on-boarding efforts. It's really an adjustment of how our managers have to spend our time in this changing environment. And that's a big part of what we look at and that's our -- that's a big part of our solution to how we handle this in the coming year. Mario Cortellacci : Yeah. And I think you guys have done a good job with managing cost and seeing margin expansion through different points in the cycle. But I guess just for 2022 and I understand that you guys don't guide, but just thinking about 2022, do you guys think you can continue the same type of historical performance with margin expansion? John Wilson : That's certainly our expectation. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. And then just the, Jerry Gahlhoff : I'm sorry, go ahead. I was just to say that, this is Jerry. I said, that's what -- that's what we strive to do; Always looking to get better. Mario Cortellacci : Okay. And then just the last one from me you guys have obviously heard about the large deal going on in the space whether it gets completed or it doesn't get completed, but if it go through and I guess just maybe how are you guys thinking about the impact, the competition within the space? I don't know if execution on their side creates opportunity for you, does a larger player impact your ability to win new business. Obviously you guys have invested in your Salesforce heavily over the past year, but and that probably sets you up better, but any thoughts around kind of the competitive dynamics and how they shift if the deal goes through? Gary Rollins : Well we we've been competing with, both concerns. We think that there's going to be a lot of work to be done on with a merger of that size, which really provides opportunity. As the term oil really has typically generated turnover as far as customers are concerned. And certainly employees are concerned many will enjoy the new relationships, but others will not. So we look at it as it, an opportunity, but that doesn't really take our eye off of our business. Cause in the end that's really what matters. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah. Mr. Rollins at the end of the, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about it, have we? It's -- it is not been high on our radar screen. We focus on what we do and getting the results that we get, and that's where we put our efforts. Gary Rollins : And it works. Jerry Gahlhoff : That's right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabra of RBC Markets, please go ahead. Ashish Sabra : Thanks for taking my question. There was a reference to a rate card increase for the termite business. I was wondering if you could talk about how the pricing is trending and is there an opportunity to flex higher than your traditional 1% to 2% as we go into 2022? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : The beauty of -- this is Jerry. The beauty of a rate card increases that unlike just a price increase to a recurring customer is that we can adjust that with a lot of flexibility in fairly real time. So if we saw a material increase in cost by X percent, we can, and pretty quickly in our rate card, moving forward, just increase our entire rate card to cover those that increase in expenses or whatever we deem necessary. And we can use the same, not only in materials and supplies, but also if we're experiencing some labor challenges or whatever, we can make those adjustments and usually make those adjustments within a week or so of us doing the analysis and figuring that out. So it's a little bit different than our recurring, like say as control or some sort of contract based revenue, price increase. It's a different model. Ashish Sabra : That's really helpful color. Maybe if I can just ask a quick follow up on that point itself. Can you just talk about which all businesses have cards? I, you, you obviously mentioned the termite but there what are other businesses where you may also have a similar rate card? Jerry Gahlhoff : Everything has a right card. John Wilson : If we acquire a business that doesn't, we put one in pretty quickly. We want to bring structure and kind of logic to our pricing and everything we do, Gary Rollins : John that's how, yeah, this is Gary, if I could add over the years, we've gotten fairly sophisticated in our rate cards and our price increases and so forth. It sounds like it's pretty simple, but we look at where the customer is currently, what they're currently charging when they've last had an increase the market, the competition and so forth. So, I think John made a great point. That's probably the first thing that we really address when we do make an acquisition. Typically competitors are, are slow to raise their rates. And we were historically, I mean, we had the same situation, but as we increased rates over the years and added the sophistication and data we've been and good at it. And it's really a margin contributor when we buy a Company Ashish Sabra : That's very helpful color. And if I could ask my second question around as you talked about the, in some of the inflationary or the employee turnover is is affecting everyone in the industry, obviously Orkin's given your brand a strong brand presence. You've been able to manage it much better versus maybe the long tail and given how fragmented the best control industry is, it potentially might be affecting the private players or the smaller players a lot more than Orkin's. And so my question there was how that help Orkin's, does that help you in terms of your growth potential, but also does it -- has that been a positive tailor from a M&A perspective? Does it open up more opportunities for M&A as some of these private or smaller players are unable to handle these inflationary pressures? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : This is Jerry. There's no doubt that the Orkin brand and the brand presence, the amount of marketing you see on television, on various social media, how they go to market, has helped their employment brand as well, to make them that Employer of Choice in our industry. And certainly they -- I'm not saying they have an easier, easy time, but they have maybe a little bit of an easier time because they do have such a strong brand and such strong brand recognition from an employment standpoint. There's certainly that, that type of tailwind that they get, there's no doubt, compared to say a, a small Mom-and-Pop Company, something along those lines. We, we definitely have some advantages there. Ashish Sabra : That's helpful. And then just, if you could talk about the M&A, how is that helpful helping you from an M&A perspective you are of the ability to acquire some of these smaller private companies, which may be struggling with this inflation of the environment? John Wilson : Yeah. So this, this is John. What I would say to that is that may be certainly a factor in their decision making kind of process to sell or not sell. I think what we saw last year, more than anything was concern over taxes and what was going to happen with that. So, I would think that that say that was a bigger factor. Ashish Sabra : That's very helpful color. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. Michael Hoffman : Hi everybody. Thank you for taking the questions this morning. So, mine comes back to growth and will you share and help us understand what composes the underlying organic growth and in a perfect world to be by line of business, but can you give us a sense of how we should think about breaking up the growth and between price, new customer ads, cross selling and where I'm going with that is you, the underlying industry growth, every on all the rate the trade groups, what have you say it's 5% roughly. So you've been growing substantially organically, substantially greater than that. Now for several years, you're not little as a Company. I'm trying to understand where's that sustainability of that, is it at the high-end a 100% or does it start easing back towards more like 50% and why? John Wilson : So, Michael, this is John. Let me kind of take a stab at what you're asking and then we'll go from there. So I'll start with the termite business. And we had kind of been in a long slow slide in terms of our termite customer base had been going down for many years. Part of that was by design. As we experienced some of the termite claims issues, that I mentioned that the -- during my piece, we moved the mix of, of business. So, we were up over 20% when that started. And I think we're now at around 17 for termite, but our termite customer base has started increasing. The last two years, we're adding to our customer base. And so that's, driving a big piece of it there as new customers, as it is in all of our segments. We're adding we added I forget the number exactly from 2020, but some, 60,000 new customers for our residential pest control group just in, or, and alone. And, the same has happening for commercial. So the lion share is, is of new with new customer additions. Keeping them just the [indiscernible] longer, always helps as well. And then we're still kind of historically at that 1% or so that we can point to and say, it's price. Anything to add Jerry, I don't\u2026 Jerry Gahlhoff : I would say if you're looking at the, the difference, what the difference is, it's really when you're improved your customer retention rate, and you are adding customers at a higher rates than you had historically, then you get the kind of growth that we get. Those are the main drivers. Michael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. And, I get the investment in people and training and what you've done to make this a better run business. How long can you sustain that wide of a gap to the underlying market growth? Jerry Gahlhoff : We're going to keep trying, we're going to keep working on it. John Wilson : Hey, Michael, we, our plan for 2022 is built on doing better than what we did in '21. So, we don't, we don't know, I guess it's probably the easy answer, but it's certainly our intention to keep chipping at it. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then Gary, you did make an in, I think it was Gary made an inference that you thought taxes drove M&A, so taxes have been put to bed. I think it would appear that we've pretty much got gridlocks. So do you expect the pace to slow or does the challenges around labor and inflation and what have you create an incremental catalyst and therefore the M&A outlook remains as promising is it was in '21? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah, Michael. So that was me, that John didn\u2019t mentioned that. And you're right. I mean, as the year wore on it got less and less maybe certain that that tax law would change. Hopefully, hopefully we're at gridlock with it. I and that, and on that subject but, but it may well happen that, that some of the other challenges, whether it's just the day to day running the business and the costs, different things, that's inflation, that's going on and buying products or whatever. They'll all add up to a continued acquisition market. We think that's kind of the case. Gary Rollins : And we started the year out with acquisition potential deals in the hopper. So that's a good sign as well. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Gary Rollins : Well, thank you. We appreciate your support and interest in Rollins. Before we close, I'd like to share that Dr. Tom Lawley has decided to retire from service on our board at the end of his current firm, on behalf of our board and our entire team and myself, we'd like to recognize and thank Dr. Lawley for everything that he's done for our organization over the last 16 years. I don't believe he's ever missed a meeting. And his contribution's mirror is distinction distinguished service with Emory. Tom, you will be missed. Rollins is excited about our opportunities for growth in 2022. And we look forward to sharing our progress during our first quarter conference call in April. Thank you again, Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Calabrese. Thank you. You may begin. Joe Calabrese : Thank you. By now you should have all received a copy of the press release. However, if anyone is missing a copy and would like to receive one, please contact our office at (212) 827-3746, and we will send you a release and make sure you're on the company's distribution list. There will be a replay of the call, which will begin one hour after the call and run for one week. The replay can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853 with the pass code 13728548. Additionally, the call is being webcast at www.rollins.com, and a replay will be available for 90 days. The company is also offering investors a supporting slide presentation, which can be found on Rollins' website at www.rollins.com. We'll be following that slide presentation on a call this morning, and encourage you to view that with us. On the line with me today and speaking are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Vice Chairman, Jerry Gahlhoff Jr. President and Chief Operating Officer and Julie Bimmerman, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks. And then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin? Gary Rollins : Yes. Thank you, Joe and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2022 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement, disclaimer, and then we will begin. Julie Bimmerman : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and for our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term objectives. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters ahead. I would now like to give an update on our SEC investigation. Rollins reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission on April 18th. The settlement fully resolves the SEC's investigation into certain adjustments to accruals and reserves and their impact on reported earnings per share in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017. Rollins paid a $8 million civil penalty, which was fully accrued in a third and fourth quarters of 2021. Under terms of the settlement Rollins, neither admits or denies the SEC's findings in this matter. The settlement completes the SEC's investigation and there will be no restatement of Rollins financials related to this matter. I want to take a moment to highlight the actions that we've taken to strengthen Rollins controls and procedures to prevent something like this from happening in the future. From the beginning, we took this matter very seriously and hired outside consultants to evaluate and strengthen our financial reporting. This included improving processes, procedures, and supporting documentation, that impact financial results. We also hired a Chief Accounting Officer, Traci Hornfeck, last October and added two retired E&Y partners to our audit committee, Susan Bell and Pat Gunning. Susan currently serves as Chair of that committee. We have also hired and added several experienced accounting personnel to further strengthen our team. Jerry will share with you details of our active CFO search to further improve this area. It is noteworthy that the SEC recognizes within the order that Rollins \"cooperation and the remedial acts were promptly undertaken to prevent and detect the type of misconduct described in the order\". Out of respect for the process, we will not answer any questions during our Q&A on this matter. I assure you that integrity is at the core of who we are as a company. And we remain committed to doing the right thing for our employees, investors, and customers. And finally, we are pleased that this matter is resolved. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some business updates. John? John Wilson : Thank you and good morning everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter financial results, with revenue increasing to $590.7 million and net income totaling $72.4 million or $0.15 per share. Overall, we experience solid growth across our family of pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Over the past couple of years, we have been actively strengthening and solidifying our Board of Directors and board committees, reflecting our commitment to effective corporate governance. For those of you who are familiar with Rollins, our Board consists of outstanding directors who have diverse backgrounds and bring invaluable experience, strong governance and their unique perspectives to our company. As part of that process, our directors have also been a key component of driving Rollins long-term strategic vision. We are pleased to announce that Gregory Morrison has been recently appointed to Rollins audit committee. Some of you may recall that Greg who joined as a Director of Rollins in 2021 served 18 years as Vice President and Corporate Chief Information Officer for Cox Enterprises. At Cox, he was responsible for the management and operations of all information technology, including cybersecurity solutions, which we believe makes him particularly well suited to join the audit committee. In addition to his responsibilities as a member of our Board's human capital management and compensation committee. We are also pleased to announce that Don Carson has been appointed to our nominating and governance committee. Don also joined our Board in 2021 and is a trusted advisor to Catheter Precision, where he also serves as a Director. Don also acts as a trustee for The Cook and Bynum Fund. Furthermore, we strengthened our Board with the recent selection of seasoned and executive Louise Sams. Louise has also been appointed to our nominating and governance committee and the compensation committee. For almost 20 years, Louise was an Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Turner Broadcasting System. As General Counsel, Louise oversaw legal work relating to Turner's business activities and at subsidiaries worldwide, including licensing and production of content for Turner Television. She was also involved in the sale and distribution of those networks. The protection of intellectual property, employment matters, as well as litigation and transactional work relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. Most recently, Louise focused on issues related to technology, information security, use of data and consumer privacy, as well as enterprise-wide risk management. We are pleased to have Louise joint our Board, and we believe her broad experience will help to further strengthen Rollins and guide our strategic direction. At our core, we are foremost a service company. Our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. Toward this end, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter Rollins was awarded a 2022 top workplaces award by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Rollins will rank 17th in the large business category, marking the sixth consecutive year we've received this award. This recognition is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution and leadership, more than 2,900 Atlanta companies participated in this program. And over 68,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. Another recent recognition that I am particularly proud of is that Newsweek ranked Rollins number eight in their article on America's Most Trustworthy Companies for 2022 in the consulting and professional services category. Over 110,000 of valuations were collected and reviewed regarding customer trust, investor trust and employee trust to receive this recognition. We remain committed to providing a workplace where our team members can grow professionally and have a positive impact on the community and many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve all the credit for Rollins achieving these honors. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John and hello everyone. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 first quarter financial results, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the quarter. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our numbers. Rollins first quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 10.3% to $590.7 million compared to $535.6 million in last year's first quarter. Net income was $72.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share. This is compared to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. This decline in EPS was primarily the result of last year's gain on the sale of Clark properties. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, all our business lines experience good growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 10.2%, commercial pest control rising 9.1% and termite increasing 13.3%. On the expense side, in the first quarter, we felt significant inflationary pressures in fleet and pest control materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these and an overview of the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these expense pressures. As you may recall from last quarter, we've been proactively addressing supply chain issues and our termite and ancillary service offerings. With our procurement team seeking alternate products and suppliers, while our operation teams have been successfully initiated increases in our rate card pricing where needed to counteract the rise in some of these material costs. We believe we've struck the right balance and these efforts are helping to bring material costs back in line for our termite and ancillary business. In the first quarter, we began experiencing similar inflationary headwinds within our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. Given the successes we've achieved, mitigating M&S costs in termite, we're implementing a proactive approach within our pest control business by adjusting our rate cards and diversifying through alternative suppliers and also by seeking shipping and freight efficiencies. Most important to improve our profit margin, we're also implementing our annual price increase programs earlier this year. These more aggressive price increases were initiated within all our brands in late spring as compared to typical timing of the early summer months in prior years. In short, we're proactive managing through this. Our fuel expense is an important example. We gave up seven tenths of a point in margin to increases in fleet expense in Q1. Through extensive routing and scheduling initiatives, we have reduced our overall mileage necessary, which lowers our fuel requirements. For our first quarter of 2022, our fuel would've been approximately $700,000 higher if we had not begun these routing and scheduling processes. This equates to an estimated addition of over 3.2 million miles driven if our miles between stops had not been reduced using our routing and scheduling technologies. We expect that we will see ongoing benefits of these improvements as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Furthermore, we continue to increase the number of hybrid and electric vehicles in our fleet, as we now have over 800 currently deployed. Next for a quick update on our acquisition pipeline. Fortunately, it's full. We have plenty of potential opportunity that we're actively engaged with. Our acquisition team has been busy, both domestic and internationally. One of our latest acquisitions highlighted in a recent press release NBC Environment, headquartered in the U.K., closed April 1st and now gives us full coverage within the U.K., including multiple locations within Scotland. Before closing, I'd like to provide an update on our Chief Financial Officer search. While we don't have an announcement to make today, we have engaged an executive search firm to assist with identifying an exceptional candidate to join our leadership team. We are focused on getting a seasoned, talented financial executive as our CFO. The search is progressing well, and we look forward to providing an update this summer. Julie has been filling in remarkably as our Interim CFO, and you can all rest assure that Julie will be remaining with Rollins as our Group Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. I know that I sleep better at night knowing that. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are of our first quarter results, given the inflationary pressures we faced and remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, Jerry. We delivered a strong first quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial me metrics. Like last quarter, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discussed during today's earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. Now onto the numbers. Our first quarter revenues of $590.7 million was an increase of 10.3% actual exchange rate and 7% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth totaled 9.6%, with 6.3% organic. As previously mentioned residential, commercial and termite all presented strong growth for the quarter. Residential grew 10.2%, 5.8% organic, commercial grew 9.1%, 7.9% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.3% with 5 8, excuse me, with 8.5% organic. Now onto our income. For the first quarter, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties of $31 million in Q1 of last year. First quarter EBITDA 2022 was $117.8 million or 4.2% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. First quarter 2022 EPS was $0.15 per diluted share or 7.1% improvement over 2021 adjusted EPS. For the first quarter 2022, gross margin decreased to 50% or 1.2 points below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q1, 2022, primarily from fuel in the amount of $4.6 million and vehicle repairs of $1.2 million over last year. Combined, these fleet expense increases equated to seven tenths of a point in additional cost. Service salaries were up four tenths of a point, while pest control materials and supplies were up $2.9 million or one 10th of a point. Fuel increases were driven by a 42% increase in average price paid per gallon in Q1, 2022, over 2021. This along with customer growth brought a 55% increase in our total fuel cost for the quarter. The service wages increase was a combination of COVID sick time taken and overtime paid to cover work for employees out sick with COVID. We face some difficult challenges in January as our reported number of employees testing positive for COVID-19 increased 154% over January, 2021. Additional overtime pay required to complete our routes and cover for these COVID cases contributed to a 21% increase over Q1, 2021. We believe this to be a one-time event unless another COVID surge occurs. Sales, general and administrative, or SG&A on the other hand, held flat Q1, 2022, over 2021 with both quarters coming in at 30.3%. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends for Q1, 2022 totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 25% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions declined 22% to $13.2 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $258.3 million in cash, of which $86.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As you've probably noted, we have also increased our term loan over last year. This will put us in a strong position to act quickly on either potential acquisitions or stock repurchases as opportunities may arise. Now to free cash flow. For the quarter of 2022, our free cash was $79.5 million or a decrease of 28.8% over last year. The decline was related to $30.6 million in payroll taxes deferred under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, in 2022 and subsequently paid in the third quarter of 2021. In comparing the current first quarter to last year, the deferral was within the Q1, 2021 operating activities. Last, I am please to share that yesterday the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2022 to shareholders of a record at the close of business May 10th, 2022. This represents a 25% increase over the dividends paid in June, 2021. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the quarter of 2022, accentuates our financial strength, the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn the call back to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions. Tim Mulrooney : Gary, Julie, Jerry, John, good morning. Julie Bimmerman : Good morning. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just had a couple about pricing, and I appreciate the color that Jerry gave. But the first one is, pricing is typically, call it, 1% to 2%. How much do you expect it to be this year? I mean, we've spoken to several regional providers who are talking about price increases of more than 5% this year. So, we're wondering if Orkin is thinking along the same lines. Julie Bimmerman : So, I'll start with this and then any of the guys can jump in if they want to add to that, Tim. As you know, our price increase will typically equate to 1% to 2% of our overall growth. And we have said bringing it 4% earlier this year and the fact that we are being more aggressive than we do expect it to increase over that. We're obviously not going to give you an exact number. As you know, we -- I'll never really do that. But keep in mind what this means by being more aggressive is there are customers that in the past that we may have considered not doing the increase or holding off a little bit longer, we'll do that. Also, there may be some areas that we may push that envelope a little bit and increase it higher by -- region by region. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah. Tim, this is Jerry. We took a hard look and as we said, we've been more aggressive than we probably ever have been in the future. And we looked at it as to from a standpoint of what will the market bear and we've just been considerably more aggressive than we have in prior years with our percentage increases. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Well, I'll take what I can get. Thank you. Maybe for my follow-up on pricing, can you talk a little bit about -- look, I think we know how it works on the residential side, you send out your price increase in the second quarter every year. So we -- that makes sense. But on the commercial side, I think it could be a little more nuanced, please correct me if I'm wrong. But I mean, my question, I guess, is, are there opportunities for pricing conversations every time you visit a commercial customer, or is it once per year or is the price fixed through the duration of the contract length? Could you just give us a little more insight on how that dynamic occurs on the commercial side? John Wilson : Tim, yeah. This is John. I'll take that. I guess, the easy answer is it depends. It depends entirely on that that customer, the contract arrangement and where we are in terms of service duration. Most of our commercial customers sort of equate service duration to the price they pay. And so, if -- we get some pretty robust reporting out of our systems to provide our managers and field sales folks with the information they need to then kind of have that conversation if service durations are exceeding kind of what our revenue per hour goal might be. So, it just depends entirely on the customer and where they are relative to all that. Gary Rollins : I'd like to add something, John. This is Gary. We have been doing price increases on a consistent program or a routine program for the last 20-plus years. And we have a tremendous database that we're able to compare the price that the customer is paying related to the current rate card, look at the exact gap, if you will, between the rate card and the price and study quite carefully what the results are going to be and so forth. So, I think it it's not a hit or miss deal. And we measure rollbacks. This would be a situation where the customer objects and we feel like -- customer is certainly profitable obviously. But we've learned that that really there's not much difference between the customers that are being rolled back. In other words, we have branches that rollback very few, maybe 10% of their customers. So, we really share that data and -- which really kind of adds integrity to what we're doing, because there there's no need to change the pricing. And then we even get something. Our attitude is, they may not have -- maybe not require the full amount of the pricing increase, but we do get some amount. So, this is something that we've been watching carefully, and it's made a big difference to our company. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would add, Tim. This is Jerry, that we were just as aggressive within our brands if not in some brands, more aggressive on the commercial side than residential even. So, we were -- we definitely touched the commercial business in a great way as it relates to price increase. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That's great color. Thank you everybody. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe on the gross margins, just given all the mitigations that you put together in terms of price increases as well as scheduling, is it fair for us to assume that the rent of the headwinds were faced in the first quarter and those headwinds moderate going forward? And again, I understand you don't give guidance, but is there a way to think about when does it inflect from being a headwind to potentially being -- where we start to start seeing gross margin expansion? Could that -- could we start to see that in the back half of the year, or do we need to wait for next to really start gross margin expanding again? Thanks. Julie Bimmerman : I'll start on that and then let everyone else jump in. So, basically, yes. On the service salaries we were talking -- we do believe that that is something that we have overcome, because we do believe that that is related to the COVID experience that we had in the early part of the year. So, unless as I say another wave of COVID comes through, we believe that we're done with that.  Also as Jerry commented, as far as the pest control M&S, yes, we're taking care of that and going through and adjusting through our procurement group. And then, also through our rate cards to make sure that we take care of that, that leaves our fuel cost from that 10 point. And so, that's where our price increase will definitely be beneficial in helping cover that. And then also as our fleet group -- I think Jerry had commented that is shifting and looking at the type of vehicles that we're using and the ones that are coming into our fleet in the future. So, most of these or half of these expenses that we're talking about, we are -- we do believe are -- were beyond those. Jerry, do you want to jump in on anything? Jerry Gahlhoff : As we also move through the year on this fuel side, we started seeing those -- the price increases in fuel by mid-year. And some of that will be a little more in our run rate of what we're accustomed to as we move through the year as well. So, there's -- that headwind will be mitigated from a year-over-year comparison standpoint as we move through the year. Julie Bimmerman : And let me add one last thing is the fact that Jerry had commented is keep in mind with our price increase coming in, we've actually brought that forward to where it is going in earlier as well to help mitigate those costs. Gary Rollins : If I could add something, most of our pest control technicians have an element of productivity and their pay plans. So, when we raised the customer's price, the technician benefits from that as well. So, it's kind of a win-win situation and makes you feel good that they're getting a raise too. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. Thank you very much. And maybe if I can ask a quick follow-up on the M&A pipeline. As you mentioned, M&A pipeline is pretty solid. I was just wondering if you could comment on the valuation. And also, on the last call, there was a comment made around restructuring foreign entities to make cash available from foreign operations more readily. So, would it be fair for us to assume that we could potentially see bigger M&A in the international markets as well? Any comments on that front? Thanks. Julie Bimmerman : I'll address the second part of that, which was on the -- we talked about the foreign subsidiaries -- or excuse me -- the cash held by foreign subsidiaries. As you noted, we had -- I believe, it was $86 million held at the end of March. Our acquisition that occurred on April 1st in the U.K., NBC was a prime example of how when we have those funds already on the -- within the foreign soil. We can use those for the acquisitions immediately and -- which we do so at that time. And we're always looking for acquisitions. We do not earmark our dollars to be domestic or international, wherever that next right company, the one that has the correct culture fit is the direction -- the acquisition we will make. So, just understand that we do not say that these dollars have to be for one or the other. Did you want to address anything else on the pipeline? Jerry Gahlhoff : And I would add on the valuation part. We really haven't seen a significant change in valuation in the market. I think, it's still a very competitive acquisition market. There's probably more private equity players involved now than there were even two years ago. There's still plenty of competition there on the valuation side that's keeping the prices of some of these businesses fairly well propped up. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks again. Very helpful color and congrats on the strong momentum in the business. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, guys. Really appreciate the time. Just my first question around kind of what the organic growth looks like in Q2, or in the back half of the year. You guys are coming up on tougher comps. I know that you guys have ramped your Salesforce as well. So, maybe you could just help us understand how much pricing is playing into helping alleviate some of that comp pressure? And then, also how much that extra Salesforce capacity that you guys have will help potentially maintain high single digit growth in Q2 and the back half of the year? John Wilson : So, Mario, this is John. I'll start and then maybe Jerry might have something to add. So, I think, when you look at the -- with the -- our business by the kind of the service line, the residential after two years of really pretty explosive growth, we'll -- I think we saw it soften in the first quarter and I think that will continue, especially given some of the weather challenges in the first four months or so of the year. But I think where the Salesforce's expansion that you mentioned will help us is on the commercial and the termite side. And I would expect our organic growth there to remain in that high single digit that you mentioned. Jerry Gahlhoff : And this is Jerry. We think -- John is absolutely right about commercial and termite that ramped up the Salesforce. I would add to the color that spring hasn't fully sprung. In that when we look at our call center data -- and you just look at the call volume from existing customers that are calling in because I have -- I need an extra service or I see something. We just see that the volume isn't quite there yet that we would expect. I think we're probably weeks late from a seasonal standpoint as well. So, we'll probably have some better color around that as we move through Q2 and see how the weather plays out and what that one spring -- one spring has sprung, we will probably have a better feel for that residential pest control side. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. I appreciate it. And then, just for my follow-up, I haven't asked you guys about this in a while. Just around technology and kind of connected technology or connected tools. How penetrated are you within your customer base on that connected technology front? I'm assuming it's probably more weighted towards the commercial customer base and the residential customer base. But any kind of quantification there would be extremely helpful. And maybe where do you think that could go over time? I mean, we're seeing in other industries where automation is helping reduce headcount or at least allow headcount to be used more efficiently. I'm just wondering if you guys have kind of thought about it internally about potential cost savings or efficiency through using kind of a connected products or Internet of Things type of tools. Jerry Gahlhoff : The work that we've done technology-wise, you're right, is very heavily on the commercial side. And I would say, at this point in time, most of the technology that we're thinking about on the residential side, all has to do with customer communication and helps us -- helping us improve our relationships with customers to improve customer retention. We have not been as focused on automation and back office type stuff, although the routing and scheduling effects if -- automated scheduling and a lot of what were manual processes can be eliminated over time with that through the routing and scheduling technologies. But most of our technology on the residential side is focused on that relationship building with the customer communications, notifications. Hey, our truck is on the way. You can see the truck on its path coming to you, those types of things that we think will improve customer loyalty. Mario Cortellacci : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael Hoffman : Thank you very much everybody for taking the question. So, I'd like to come back to price with a little different angle and clarity. The -- if I understand the way you're describing the timing of it, first quarter 2022 does not reflect the benefit of being more aggressive. And therefore, that's in front of us coming into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. Julie Bimmerman : Exactly. You're thinking correctly, Michael. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And on the commercial growth, can you help us understand -- I'm trying to get a feel for the macro. So, this is as much as about your businesses that is a read through just given all the things that are going on a geopolitical basis. I have this sense that there's been a trend of new business formation happening in North America, but really began to ramp in the second half of last year. And that has not peaked. Do you think your commercial organic growth reflects that there is new business formation, meaning you're adding incremental new customers as opposed to upselling existing? Jerry Gahlhoff : We're probably doing a better job at adding new customers and then adding services on to the existing. Yeah. We're growing through new customers. Michael Hoffman : So, you would support the idea that there's new business formation going on still that we have -- that has not peaked. So, whatever fears about slowing consumer demand and recessions and what have, you haven't seen that come through on somebody starting a business in the empty storefront that needs a pest service. Jerry Gahlhoff : I don't know that there are start-ups from new businesses or it's just existing businesses making a change or initiating services for the first time. We really don't have much insight into that unfortunately for you, Michael. Sorry. Michael Hoffman : No. Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We're optimistic about our opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a very strong financial performance in the second quarter and remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. On today's call, I'm excited to share our strategic management succession plan that has been unanimously approved by our Board of Directors. We firmly believe that this is the right time to initiate this important leadership transition. Effective January 1, 2023, Jerry Gahlhoff, the Rollins Chief Operating Officer and President, will be elevated to the position of Chief Executive Officer or CEO. I'll remain Chairman of the Board, and Jerry will continue in his current role as President of Rollins. The following five months will be transitional while Jerry becomes more familiar with the areas involving his future responsibilities. The Company is well positioned financially and operationally. We have a proven management team, leading brands and a very strong culture. I'm extremely confident in the future of Rollins and look forward to working closely with Jerry to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. While I'll be moving away from the day-to-day operations, as I continue serving as our company Chairman of the Board, I will remain active and focused on our business goals and strategic plans. As many of you know, Jerry has been with Rollins since the 2008 acquisition of HomeTeam. And he's been instrumental in our success. What most don't know is that Jerry grew up in an Orkin household as his father worked for the Company for 26 years. His dad was a great employee. Jerry is an exceptional leader with great vision and a deep understanding of our industry and our customers. His years of service to Rollins has been marked by outstanding performance and accomplishments. He was promoted to Rollins President and Chief Operating Officer in 2020 and has had a unique opportunity to be intimately involved in most every facet of our organization. In 2021, Jerry joined the Rollins Board of Directors. His business acumen, leadership experience, strong sense of duty and his devotion to our company make him a natural fit to assume our President and Chief Executive Officer role. I have the utmost confidence that Jerry will continue to foster our strong company heritage record of accomplishments and promote the culture of Rollins. Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our Vice Chairman, who will provide some business updates. John? John Wilson : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of all of us here at Rollins, I would like to congratulate Jerry on his long successful tenure as Rollins CEO. Gary's 56-year career with our company has been marked by superior achievements and an unrelenting focus on our customers, our shareholders and our employees. He's a tremendous leader. And in addition to his impressive business results over the multiple decades, he has been steadfast in leading Rollins' high-performance culture. But the best part about this change is that he isn't going anywhere and will continue to be a valuable resource to all of us. Turning to our performance. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results with revenue increasing to $714 million and net income totaling $100 million or $0.20 per share. Overall, we experienced solid growth across our numerous pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Finally, you've heard me say this many times, we regard our employees as our most important asset. They are an integral part of our success. As we continue to grow, we recognize the talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for that talent. Consistent with that approach, we're continually looking to improve our employee benefits and I'm pleased to announce that Rollins has partnered with Everside Health to offer an on-site health center located at our Atlanta home office. This new health center offers convenient primary care services for everything from screenings and prevention to chronic disease management and urgent care for several thousand of our employees in the area. There are multiple benefits and features to this program, including same-day and next-day appointments, on-site lab draws, medications and immunizations, mental health services and the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. In addition to our Atlanta facility, our U.S. employees have access to over 70 Everside Health clinics, and we are live in 37 states for virtual primary care. The safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority, and we believe offering this new benefit will lead to better health outcomes, allowing employees to live healthier lives. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business. Congratulations, Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. Before I get into our second quarter operating review, I would like to say a few words about Gary. As Gary mentioned, I came to Rollins through the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. As many of you know, those can be tensed in uncertain times for those being acquired. Gary talked with me personally. His words and subsequent actions reassured me that I had found a home at Rollins and my experience here has been meaningful and worthwhile. Over the past 14 years, I've learned so much from Gary, and there's one thing I'm sure of, he has an unwavering commitment to our company, our customers and our employees. The proof of this is in his actions and results. It's truly an honor to succeed Gary as CEO and lead this incredible company of more than 17,000 exceptional employees, each of whom brings a commitment to deliver the best for our customers every day. With Gary and John's continued guidance, I look forward to continuing to build on our great success as we begin this new chapter of the Company's future. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 second quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our financial results. Rollins second quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 11.9% to $714 million compared to $638 million in last year's second quarter. Net income was $100.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share. This is compared to $98.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, during the quarter, all our business lines continued to experience solid growth. In fact, we grew double digits in all service lines. Residential pest control increased 11%, commercial pest control was up 11.2% and termite increased 15%. Keep in mind that this level of growth came on top of our company's highest historical recorded growth in Q2 last year of 15.3%. On the expense side, we continue to feel inflationary pressures during the second quarter from fleet-related costs like fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these as well as provide an update on the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. While we're efficiently navigating through this period and believe that our proactive initiatives have helped, we're keeping a watchful eye on inflationary pressures, fuel costs and supply chain costs and how they may affect Rollins. Management of fuel expense is a notable example. As we grow, we improved customer density. And when coupled with our routing and scheduling technology initiatives, we continue to reduce our overall mileage between service visits, which lowers our fuel requirements. We saved over 5.8 million miles driven in the quarter or $1.3 million. This savings was slightly offset by increased average price per gallon over Q2 2021 of over $400,000, equating to net fuel savings of $875,000. This has also helped manage labor costs as our technicians have less unproductive windshield time, plus we've created a better job for them along the way. As we move through the second half of 2022, we expect we'll see the ongoing benefits of these improvements. Furthermore, looking ahead, we're committed to enhancing the overall efficiency of our fleet while also reducing carbon emissions. In June, we announced that BMW Group ranked Rollins 15th out of the top 50 green fleets in the United States. This primarily reflects Rollins use of hybrid sedans that are being driven by our sales and management personnel. However, we recently began testing the use of light-duty hybrid trucks. Given their excellent fuel economy, we are focused on having a sizable uptick in our hybrid truck fleet by 2024. Additionally, given recent technology advancements, we've been testing the use of battery-powered application equipment going from gas power to battery provides us with a compelling opportunity to reduce emissions without sacrificing the effectiveness of our service. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives in the quarters ahead. As you may recall from prior conference calls, we've been proactively addressing increased supply chain costs in our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. This includes termite and ancillary service offerings as well. We have solid long-term working relationships with our manufacturers and have deep visibility into the supply process, often a few levels up in the supply chain. In doing so, we're often able to achieve greater operational efficiencies and overall flexibility by not only having materials shipped quickly but also having real-time insights advising us when we need to order materials. We continue to seek opportunities to diversify through alternative suppliers and actively seek shipping and freight efficiencies. On the subject of pricing, we successfully implemented our annual price increase programs earlier this year. As mentioned on our last conference call, aggressive service price increases were initiated within all our brands during April and May as compared to historical timing of the early summer months and prior years. We are already realizing a notable benefit from this initiative more than doubling our traditional 1% to 2% net growth levels from our past price increase programs. Overall, we saw little resistance from our customers on the higher price increases put into place, which is a confirmation of service satisfaction. Next, on our acquisition pipeline, it remains strong, and we have plenty of potential opportunities that we are actively pursuing. So far in 2022, we have completed 22 strategic acquisitions within the U.S., United Kingdom and Australia. In the U.K., we achieved an important milestone during the quarter with the acquisition of Europest. In addition to expanding our geographic footprint within the U.K., it is also our first location in Wales. Strategically, we now have full coverage within the United Kingdom, as this tuck-in transaction comes on the heels of another recent U.K. acquisition, NBC Environment, which provided our first locations within Scotland. Moving forward, Strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow and expand our business. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins second quarter results and that we remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie? Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, Jerry. First, I would like to congratulate both Gary and Jerry on reaching the next pinnacles in their careers. Gary, your extraordinary impact on Rollins has been legendary. Jerry, you definitely have large shoes to fill as CEO. Jerry, also watching your career grow from our early days at HomeTeam to President of Rollins has been exciting, and I have no doubt that you will excel in this new role. I appreciate your trust and leadership through the years and cannot wait to see what the future holds. So now on to the numbers. We delivered a strong second quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics. As a reminder, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discussed during today's earnings presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on News and Events and presentation. Our second quarter revenues of $714 million represented an increase of 11.9% actual exchange rate, 8.7% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth totaled 10.7% with 7.5% organic. As Jerry mentioned, residential, commercial and termite all presented strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Residential grew 11%, 7% organic. Commercial grew 11.2%, 9.3% organic. Lastly, we have termite, which grew 15% with 11.2% organic. Now on to our income. For the second quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for 2021 for comparison purposes due to the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties of $450,000 in Q2 of last year, and $31.5 million year-to-date in 2021. Second quarter EBITDA of 2022 was $159.2 million or 1.2% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $157.3 million. Second quarter 2022 EPS was $0.20 per diluted share equal to 2021 adjusted EPS. Second quarter 2022 gross margin decreased to 52.8% or 0.5 point below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q2 2022 primarily from fuel presenting an increase of $6.8 million and vehicle repairs of $1.7 million over last year. Fuel increases were driven by over a 50% increase in our average price paid per gallon in Q2 2022 over 2021. Vehicle repairs were up due to the continued delay in receipt of new vehicles from the manufacturers. We keep our trucks longer, forcing repairs outside of our norm. Combined, these fleet expenses -- these fleet expense increases equated to 0.9 point in additional cost, taking these fleet-related increases out of the equation, gross margin increased over last year. Sales, general, administrative, or SG&A as a percentage of revenue for Q2 2022 increased over 2021 by 2.1% to 30.8%. Travel was a contributor as this increased 65.7% over Q2 2021. This was due to a return to normalized levels for leadership travel to branch locations along with overall increased cost in air travel and rental cars. We also saw an increase in advertising from a combination of an increase in our advertising campaign to counteract the late arrival of spring along with the impact of a change in our process for estimating and accruing our advertising expenses. Aligning these costs with our high Q2 sales equated to an increase in advertising of 2% of revenues over Q2 2021. For the full year, we expect overall normalized historical spend levels for advertising. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends Q2 2022, totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 22% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions increased 218.7% to $36.4 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $221 million in cash, of which, $62.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our free cash flow for Q2 was $119.4 million or an increase of 26.6% over last year. This increase was primarily driven by timing of income tax payments. Last, I'm pleased to share that yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on September 9, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2022. This represents a 25% increase over the dividend paid in September 2021. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the second quarter of 2022, it situates our financial strength and the Board's confidence in our continued growth. Gary, I'll turn it back over to you. Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : First, I just want to say to Gary, congratulations. Very few CEOs can boast the same level of tenure and success that you can and I look forward to staying in touch regardless. Gary Rollins : Thank you. Tim Mulrooney : First one, EBITDA margins were down a little bit more this quarter than I was expecting. And what was helpful last quarter as you guys bucketed these things for us. The primary buckets being fuel or I don't know if you want to call it, fleet, another major cost bucket is labor and another one is materials, if you were going to rank those headwinds in terms of the things that impacted your EBITDA margins the most and if there's any way to quantify it. I think that would be really helpful for investors, it certainly was very helpful for us last quarter. Julie Bimmerman : Sure. Tim, this is Julie. So I'll jump in. So I would say the -- our largest impact was getting back to the advertising expenses we said, which was gain -- or excuse me, an increase of 2% of our revenues. And I do want to go ahead and go over this. This is where we updated our quarterly processes for estimating and accruing our advertising expenses to better reflect our shift to digital advertising. I do want to make a point on this, though, and this is the key point is this, we will maintain the normalized historical percentage of revenue spend for the advertising when you look at the year as a whole. So we are dealing with timing there. The next largest item would have been our fuel and the fuel itself was a $6.8 million increase over last year. So that was significant over Q2 of last year. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would add that from a labor standpoint, we did a pretty good job of keeping service wages, in particular, relatively flat year-over-year. That really wasn't a significant driver of everything. It's heavily on what Julie mentioned. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. So I mean that's very consistent with what you said last quarter. I guess, labor had more disruption in January. But you were saying that, that wouldn't be as much of an issue going forward. It sounds like it's not, it's mostly fleet and advertising expense. So that's really helpful. Jerry Gahlhoff : January, it was driven by the COVID situation, which is just seems to be ramping back up again, but we're managing through it a little better right now. Operator : Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Congrats to both of you, Gary and Jerry. My first question would be on the revenue growth, pretty strong momentum there across all businesses. I was wondering if you could help parse out -- you obviously talked about a more aggressive price increase, but also if you can talk about the improved retention as well as on the sales momentum side, can you talk about how the improved ad campaign helped you more on the inbound, but also the technicians being appropriately staffed? How is that helping you drive sales momentum. So if you could just parse out some of the growth drivers and quantify some of those tailwinds? Jerry Gahlhoff : Well, I think on the -- Julie, on the revenue growth side, we certainly got some additional lift from the price increase part that helped us quite a bit. We were lapping a pretty big second quarter last year, in particular, our -- the month of April and in 2021 was really difficult to lap from a growth standpoint, but we managed through it pretty well, and things picked up quite a bit in May and June to help recover from there. Retention remains -- customer retention remains strong, and our team is doing a pretty good job on service delivery. We're staffed better than we were a year ago from a technician standpoint, being able to get to new customers, service our existing customers. So that's all good. We've gotten a lot of positive response to, in particular, Orkin's transition to -- with their new ad campaigns. Especially with the Orkin Pro, we've received a lot of very strong feedback. Our -- the people that work at Orkin, our team members at Orkin really like it. It's getting a lot of attention. I know it's good when I hear about it from my children because they're seeing it on TikTok. And so they see those ads on TikTok and seem to have a lot of fun with them. Julie Bimmerman : Yes. And then to add on to that, just as a reminder, I think Jerry commented on his section of the script is our price increase that brought in over double what we typically see from our annual price increase. So that was a part of that growth as well. Operator : Our next question is from Hamza Mazari with Jefferies. Hans Hoffman : This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. Could you just give us a sense of how much capacity you have in your sales force and what your hiring plans are going forward? Jerry Gahlhoff : We're pretty well staffed on the sales side, both in the commercial and residential side. we can always -- there's always room for improvements to drive -- when you have a salesperson at full capacity or selling high levels monthly, the next step to do is hire another and build them back up and continue to drive that incremental growth and get improvements. So we always -- there's always a little bit of capacity there to do better. But as we get closer to capacity, we look to add staffing where it makes sense. And we're always -- that's just kind of a numbers game and math game that we play. Julie Bimmerman : Yes. And that's where we really worked hard at the end of last year is when we started doing the heavy staff up on our commercial side of our sales force just so that we could be prepared for this year and be able to honestly be able to close the deals that we're closing today. Jerry Gahlhoff : And certainly, the commercial results that we're getting are a result of those -- the increased staffing and the increased productivity for sales rep that we're seeing. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Seth Weber : Congratulations, guys. I just had a question on, I think fuel prices started picking up last June, June 2021. So is it -- so now that we have kind of an apples-to-apples compare going forward, should we expect gross margin to be up year-over-year for the rest of the year or is that the right way to think about it? Julie Bimmerman : I'll start, and then I'm sure Jerry will want to jump in as well. Everything -- we're all reading the same thing when it comes to fuel is we -- a lot of things -- areas say that the fuel prices are going to be going down, but then we see things that are happening on the other side of the globe that gives the impression that it could go up. So, so much depends on that. So if you're assuming that fuel does not keep on having that variability, we'll definitely -- that's one thing to keep in mind. But I also want to address materials and supplies. Jerry commented on this as well. And I'm going to jump in and use the phrase that Jerry has commented on in the Board meeting yesterday. He said that sometimes we feel like we're playing whack-a-mole with the materials and supplies because we have different vendors and different that are looking at -- they have to make increases to cover either their shipping or cover their supply costs themselves. And we keep on having to jump in. We're having to look every single day and see in our purchasing group is saying, where do we need to go. Where should we be purchasing. And really monitoring these relationships. It's a long way of saying it depends what's going to happen with our vendors. It depends what's going to happen with our suppliers. And honestly, the fuel prices. All of that being said, if that calms down, then yes, margins would improve. Do you want to add to that? Jerry Gahlhoff : I would agree that those are the two main variables. It's going to be what happens with fuel and fleet and can we get our -- the trucks on time that we are expecting to be delivered to us. Can we get -- they can get delivered and we can start heading off some of these repair expenses that we're having. And then plus we have the ongoing benefit of offsetting some of these costs over the coming months with routing and scheduling, more of the technology adoption and advancement that we can get out there and increase usage of the tools they have, especially during busy season, that will help us with those offsets. Not too concerned about the labor side. I think we'll manage the labor. But certainly, fuel and vehicle repairs and materials supplies. Those are the wildcards that were basically managed through a very -- it seems like every week, we're getting notified about some other price increase that we're having to make adjustments to from suppliers. So that's why Julie said it's like playing whack-a-mole. So as long as we remain vigilant on that, and we'll see what happens from a fuel standpoint. That's the wildcard. Operator : Our final question is from Brian Butler with Stifel. Brian Butler : Just to follow up, I guess, on pricing and inflation. If inflation continues to move higher or even accelerate, is there a potential another rate increase the back half of 2022 or maybe a surcharge that would be used to offset that? Or would Rollins wait until maybe next year to catch up and then address the higher costs? Gary Rollins : We've done quite a bit of research as far as our price increases are concerned. And certainly, we would be opposed to having another price increase this year. We really studied the frequency and the amount very carefully. And it's been our experience that you really need to have some time in between and don't get greedy. Operator : Thank you. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. And thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

Gary Rollins : Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins' third quarter performance was highlighted by continued growth and solid financials. As we look ahead, the company remains well positioned to continue accomplishment of our long-term business objectives. I'm also proud to welcome Rollins' new Chief Financial Officer, Kenneth Krause. Ken is a highly regarded business executive with more than two decades of financial and accounting experience. Ken is already contributing to our success. We welcome him to our team. Jerry will share more about Ken later. Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our Vice Chairman, who will provide some business updates. John? John Wilson : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Rollins delivered another strong performance this quarter, reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies. I want to continue to emphasize that Rollins' success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work for our company. This incredible team works hard every day to achieve our objectives and take great care of our customers. At Rollins, our people are our most valuable asset. Pursuant to that, we are always looking to improve our employee training and benefit offerings as well as providing a workplace where they are respected and able to grow professionally. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Everside Health to offer on-site health center providing primary care at our Atlanta home office and virtually nationally. This new program offers free or reduced cost primary care for all employees. We're pleased to share that since its opening four months ago, this effort has registered over 500 employee visits and filled over 300 prescriptions. We are very focused on enabling our employees to live healthier lives at home and at work, while enjoying multiple benefits within this effort. With same day and next day appointments, this help center handles everything from routine screenings to chronic disease management. It also offers on-site lab draws, medication prescriptions, immunizations, mental health services, as well as the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. Further, we plan to expand this free primary care offering to the covered dependence of our team members starting January 1st. Feedback to date has been extremely positive with a very high satisfaction rate. Ultimately, we believe that by providing easier access to these kinds of services, we are facilitating better health outcomes and happier, healthier employees. We also recently expanded our employee stock purchase plan. This plan allows employees the option to purchase shares of Rollins' common stock at a 10% discounted price through payroll deductions. Since we launched the plan in July 2022, we are pleased that over 2,200 employees have enrolled. This represents greater than 130% growth in employee stock ownership participants compared to our previous program. Most importantly, we want to encourage employee ownership in Rollins as we want everything - everyone to think and act like owners in our company. In summary, guided by our commitment to employees and our culture, we feel these types of benefit programs an improvement - are important to our long term success, not only by retaining and incentivizing our valued employees at all levels and for them to have a vested interest in our performance but also, to effectively position Rollins brands as a leading contender for top talent. Last, I would like to discuss Hurricane Ian. Thank goodness, all of our employees in the Ian's path are safe, but they have needed an assistance. Through our Rollins Employee Relief Fund, our team provided over 170 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first 10 days following the hurricane to enable team members to address essential needs. Since then, the relief team has been processing multiple full grants to address employees who have endured even greater hardship. Our hearts go out to those affected by the hurricane, but I must acknowledge how excited we were about all our team members who have jumped in to assist those impacted in various ways. They quickly volunteered their time and energy often after work hours to gather, load and deliver supplies to those most in need. This was a total team effort and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to help one another. Overall, while Ian shut down a total of 28 branch offices, 18 were only closed for a day or two, while the remainder opened by the end of the following week. Between these few location closures and the loss of several vehicles within our fleet, the impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. In early August, we announced that Ken Krause will be joining Rollins as our new Chief Financial Officer effective September 1st. Ken has many years of finance experience, most recently as the CFO of a large publicly-traded global manufacturer. You'll hear from him in a little bit, but for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of speaking with him yet, he is passionate about business, very experienced and has a unique combination of strategic, operational and financial expertise. We are extremely pleased to have him as a member of our leadership team. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 third quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment. Looking at our financial results, Rollins' third quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 12.2% to $730 million compared to $650 million in last year's third quarter. Net income was $108 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This is compared to $94 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. Operationally during the quarter, all of Rollins business lines continue to experience solid growth. Residential pest control increased 9.8%, commercial pest control was up 11.4%, and termite increased 18.9%. Overall, organic presented a strong 8.6% total growth for the quarter. Next, I'd like to turn to the expense side. During the last few conference calls, we have discussed various inflationary pressures, primarily fleet-related costs, specifically fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. We've also provided insights into the proactive actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. In this context, I'm pleased to note that during Q3, we're beginning to see a gradual improvement in fuel prices. We've also been reducing our overall mileage per service visit through routing and scheduling initiatives. Overall, when compared to last quarter, Q3 presented a 5% reduction in fuel expense. On the fleet side, as we discussed previously, we're keeping our trucks longer forcing higher than normal cost for items like basic maintenance and tires, as well as some repairs outside of the norm. Recently, a small amount of new fleet vehicles are beginning to arrive from our primary manufacturers, which certainly will help. However, the quantities are less than what we historically received by this point of the year. Looking ahead, we're told by our manufacturers that the supply environment is improving and that potentially we could expect an uptick in inflow levels for new vehicles in the coming quarters. As we've received similar assurances last year, we're certainly keeping a watchful eye on this and we'll keep you updated on future conference calls. On the labor side, even though the tight labor market, Rollins remain well positioned in effectively attracting, retaining and deploying talent by prioritizing employee well-being, workplace inclusion and professional development opportunities, while also providing attractive employee benefit offerings. We have a track record of being a premier destination for talent. As we headed into peak hiring season this year, we successfully integrated a recruiting software platform to allow our hiring managers to more efficiently recruit and engage with potential new candidates. This talent recruitment platform makes it easier for prospective team members to explore open positions on our career portals and apply for open positions in just a few minutes and they can do so easily from a mobile device. Our hiring managers can more easily pre-screen candidates, communicate with them and schedule interviews in a more streamlined way. As a result of this new improved process, we averaged 35,000 job applicant submittals per month for the third quarter. And over the last five months, we have almost matched the total year 2021 application submittals. In short, by offering candidates an enhanced hiring experience, we've been able to successfully source and add qualified talent across the country despite the tight labor market. Next, I'd like to turn to acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have completed 27 acquisitions. Five of these were completed in the third quarter across Canada, Australia and the U.S. In August, we announced the acquisition of Bug House Pest Control. Bug House Pest Control was Founded by Mike Prosperi in 1993, and has grown to be one of the largest pest control companies in Georgia. Bug House serves residential and commercial customers throughout Central and South Georgia. We are proud to welcome their more than 220 team members to Rollins. We continue to pursue potential opportunities as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, our pipeline remains strong. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins' strong third quarter performance. We are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Krause : Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and I look forward to working with Jerry and the team across Rollins as we continue to drive value for all of our stakeholders. During my first 60 or so days, I've had the opportunity to spend time with several of our key stakeholders. I've spoken with investors and attended investor conferences. I've spent time at industry trade shows and visited with our teams in the field. It has been beneficial to interact with our investors, employees, vendors and customers. As I reflect on my experiences thus far, I want to highlight two key observations. First, Rollins has a strong commitment to doing what is right and best for all of our stakeholders. Our commitment to our customers and employees is second to none. The company places a tremendous amount of effort on promoting a culture that is focused on solving our customers' problems the first time and providing our employees with a workplace where they can build a long and rewarding career. Second, our strategy is driving strong results. We have a very valuable business model, well recognized brands and a strong financial position by which we can drive profitable growth. Let me start by highlighting a few key accomplishments in the quarter. First, revenue growth was strong with organic revenue growing just under 9% on an as reported basis. Second, EBITDA margins were healthy at 23.3%, up 10 basis points versus the same period a year ago, despite incurring higher casualty reserve charges. These charges weighed down EBITDA margins by approximately 140 basis points in the quarter. I will spend more time on the casualty reserve in a bit, but it was good to see the strong margin performance in this challenging inflationary period. Earnings per share improved 15% to $0.22 per share and free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 60% versus the same period a year ago. Let's now dive into the quarterly results in more detail. Quarterly revenue was $730 million, up just over 12% on a reported basis. This includes approximately 4% of growth from acquisitions. Currencies reduced sales growth by 50 basis points on the stronger dollar notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. It was good to see strong organic growth across our service lines. All services commercial, residential and termite services grew at a double-digit growth rate with very strong organic growth in commercial and termite businesses. Residential revenues increased approximately 10% with growth stemming from both acquisitions and organic activity. We also had strong growth across substantially all of our brands. We are not seeing any significant signs of slowing and retention rates are not changing materially. Overall, demand for our services remains robust to start the fourth quarter. Turning to profitability. Gross profit was 52.3% of sales in the quarter, down 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The decline is driven primarily by an increase in our casualty reserve related to auto claims. As I said earlier, this increase drove EBITDA margins down by 140 basis points in the quarter with the most significant impact on gross profit. This expense in the quarter was driven by a number of auto-related claims that matured in the quarter. These claims tend to change from time-to-time and we either reached resolution or received additional information about the nature of the claim that provided for a better estimation of the total liability associated with the claim in the quarter. Excluding this, we saw improvement in gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures and increases associated with people, fleet and other areas. Pricing and managing our margins remains at the top of our agenda. SG&A expense in the quarter was just under $214 million or 29.3% of sales, up approximately $20 million from the prior year. As a percent of revenue, we realized 60 basis points of leverage in SG&A on the double-digit sales growth, which helped to offset the gross profit headwinds. GAAP operating income was $145 million or 19.7% of revenue, up 20 basis points from the year ago period. EBITDA margin was 23.3%, up 10 basis points over the prior year. As I indicated, the increased expense associated with claims activity negatively impacted EBITDA margins by 140 basis points. I like to look at the business using incremental margins or what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. And in the quarter, on an as reported basis, we generated 24% incremental margins, but over 35% when you consider the quarter included the higher expense associated with the claims activity. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.22 in earnings per share, increasing 15% versus the same period a year ago on the 12% increase in reported revenue. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated over $120 million of free cash flow on a $108 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 60% in the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling approximately $60 million in the third quarter and we paid just under $50 million of dividends. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1 times on a gross level. Cash balances approximated debt balances to end the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions totaling just over $110 million and paid dividends of approximately $148 million. Debt balances are down $30 million since the beginning of the year and cash is up over $16 million, finishing at $122 million to finish the third quarter. Speaking of dividends, we increased our regular quarterly dividend last night to $0.13 per share, an increase of 30% versus the third quarter a year ago. With this announcement, this will enable us to realize an increasing dividend again in 2022. We are well positioned to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. Our focus is to consistently fund a regular dividend that increases as our business grows, while continuing to use our balance sheet to fund additional acquisition-related growth. Our third quarter performance demonstrated the strength of our business model. Organic demand remains robust and we are well positioned to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is very healthy and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving a long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Gary for closing remarks. Gary? Gary Rollins : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Good morning, everybody. Gary Rollins : Good morning. Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning. Kenneth Krause : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : So, first I wanted to ask on the residential business. Well, first I should say congratulations on a great quarter, but I wanted to dig into the residential business for just a second, because there is some concern right now about the state of the consumer, and I was hoping that you could comment on the trends that you're seeing with respect to volumes in your resi business specifically. Are you starting to see any slowdown as we move from August to September to October, given the increased macro uncertainty, and could you maybe comment on how lead generation these days compares to maybe to last year? Jerry Gahlhoff : Tim, this is Jerry. The residential businesses is - it remain strong. Certainly, leads are down a little bit. It's hard to always - you don't know if it's economic, if - is it weather driven, those kinds of things. It's hard to attribute it. Despite that, we still have our challenges keeping up with the lead volume that we get in the quarter. And when you also look at the quarter on the residential side, we were impacted at the end of the quarter if you see it kind of dragging a little lower than the other two categories. We were impacted the worst possible time for that hurricane was end the month at the end of the quarter, and that was a revenue drag in Southwest Florida and parts of Florida, where we're very heavily weighted on the residential side. And so that - to end the quarter, that was a bit challenging but - and that's certainly had more of a drag on residential revenue than necessarily some change in demand. John or anybody you have anything to add there? John Wilson : Well, the only thing I would add Tim is that leads for residential have been down for some time. Quality of lead and lead closure has been up, leading to increased sales and increasing organic revenue but lead closure or leads receives excuse me as a measure of the strength of the residential business is not really unnecessarily a good yardstick. We continue to close at a higher rate and our - and where we can give some labor challenges, our teams are getting to the work. So we're still seeing strength in it. Is it as strong as it was over the last couple of years? Maybe not, but we're very optimistic still about residential. Kenneth Krause : The only thing I would add as well is from a revenue perspective as Jerry had pointed out. We had good revenue growth throughout the quarter. It was interesting, when we look at the revenue growth by month throughout the quarter in the residential area, we saw a little bit of weakness in July associated with just some COVID exposures and some challenges with COVID, but August was exceptionally strong and September was very healthy as well, but unfortunately, our ability to deliver services was hampered by the hurricane, which hit us late in the quarter. So overall, business remains pretty well intact on the residential side. Jerry Gahlhoff : And let's not forget that hurricane also impacted South Carolina as well, went through there, which is another area where we have a large - a very large presence on the residential standpoint. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color everybody. So it sounds like - yes and Jerry you're right like that's exactly what I was looking at. I was looking at the trend slowing down in residential, but it seems like that might be much more related to the hurricane than anything else and it's still a very strong result. So it sounds like demand remained strong there. My last question is maybe for Ken or Julie. It's just a quick one. The 8.6% organic growth figure, does that just exclude acquisitions? In other words, if I exclude the 50 basis points of foreign currency headwind, would organic growth have been more like 9.1% for the quarter? Kenneth Krause : You're thinking about that correct, Tim. We had a 50 basis point headwind on revenues. The 8.6% is an as reported organic number. So adding back the currency headwind, your organic growth would have been just north of 9%. Tim Mulrooney : Thank you everybody. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question, and again, let me add my congrats as well to the solid quarter. I just wanted to focus more on the cross-selling opportunities. I was wondering if you could talk about how much traction are you getting on cross selling into your existing customer base? And also as the technicians are more appropriately staffed, how is that helping drive better sales momentum among your existing but also new customers? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : So a lot of what you see in the termite ancillary growth is a result of cross-selling to your existing customer base, so that's where we get a lot of the lift - is on the termite ancillary side is directly through cross-sell opportunity. So that continues to remain strong and continues to be a great opportunity for us for certainly for years to come. We have seen a nice uptick this year also in technicians sales that has in some ways offset our - a little bit of the lead decline, and the better we know the better staffed we are with technicians, the more technicians will actively sell. So getting that formula right is good and we have certainly seen an uptick in technician involved sales, where it could be upgrades on the commercial side but as well as on the residential side as well. We see - we do see sales productivity ticking up with technicians. Ashish Sabadra : That's great. And maybe if I can just have a follow up question on the margins. The incremental margins of 35% excluding the one-time item looks like a very strong margin growth profile. As we think about going forward, not necessarily from a guidance perspective but as we think about some of the puts and takes and inflation rolling over and revenue momentum being strong, is that the right way to think about the incremental margins going forward? Thanks. Kenneth Krause : Ashish, I don't want to commit to something too early here. I am only 60 days or so in, but what I'll tell you is the gross margin profile of 50 plus percent is certainly an appealing gross margin profile and provides me a sense of confidence in our ability to generate that type of margin profile, but what I'd ask for is a little bit of time to better understand the business and some of the drivers that we have in the business. But nonetheless, that gross margin profile that we do have and the pricing opportunities we have in our business gives me some confidence in our ability to continue to improve our margins going forward. Ashish Sabadra : That's great. Congrats once again on such a good quarter. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Seth Weber : Hey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Ken. I guess, I just wanted to ask a question on pricing. Can you just kind of catch us up on where you're at with pricing? I think you pushed through increases in April and May and I think on the last call, you talked about that was going to be it for like for the year, but can just maybe talk to us about your thoughts on pricing going forward, whether you - if the inflationary environment continues, whether you might take another shot at raising pricing and just whether it sounds like maybe there has been a little bit of push back, maybe some - maybe attrition ticked up a little bit is what it's sounded like from your messaging, but if there is - if you're seeing any kind of customer churn based on the pricing actions you've taken? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : So we feel like our price increase program was very successful this year and certainly, as Ken noted, it attributed some of our success here in the third quarter to pricing, not only to our - through rate increases, but also increasing our rate cards and our new sales pricing is up rather significantly, that's been helpful. Our strategy will be to get through the rest of this fiscal year. In January, we'll all meet again, and we'll have a discussion about our price increase strategy for 2023 and assess what the economic environment looks like, what's going on and make some determinations at that point. We need to have those discussions in - fairly early in the year if we're going to keep it on the same cycle to be able to deploy that price increase by March and April timeframes, should we - depend on what levels we go at. So - and part of that process in January will also be a very lengthy look back - detailed look back into our price increase campaign this year, what the impact on rollbacks and customer retention was, and we'll use those data to help us determine what we will - what our plan will look like in 2023. We've monitored that. We haven't noticed any real significant jump in retention due to pricing, so we feel pretty good about where we are right now. Seth Weber : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just maybe can you just touch on what you're seeing in the international markets? I know, it's not a big part of your business, but if there's any notable changes in trends internationally versus U.S.? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : I guess, internationally, we see some of the - feeling a little bit of some of the impact in the U.K. of their inflationary pressures there, but our business in the United Kingdom is doing quite well, that team there is thriving. Same in Australia. They're performing very well. So we're very happy with the results that we're getting internationally. Singapore is a little down. They've had some a little more challenges on the revenue growth side and that's been largely - they were engaged during the peak of COVID with a lot of disinfection services and some of those disinfection services have disappeared. And so they've struggled a little bit more, not necessarily because of any economic conditions more just a shift in what's going on in the market from a pest control and disinfection standpoint. But overall, internationally, you think of Canada as well, our Canadian operations are doing fantastic and they're growing well. So it's all very positive on that front. Seth Weber : Great. Okay. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed. Hans Hoffman : Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering, could you maybe dive in a bit on kind of what drove the strength in the commercial and termite business? Jerry Gahlhoff : I didn't quite catch what you asked for. So, could you repeat your question for me? Hans Hoffman : Yes. Could you just talk a little bit sort of what drove the strength in the commercial and termite business? Jerry Gahlhoff : A lot of that is having feet on the street and staff and having the staffing and the quality team on both the commercial and the number of home inspectors we have in the field. It's really about being staffed to handle demand and drive those - drive the sales results that we get. You look at our headcount of commercial account managers and our head - the volume of home inspectors that we've added over the last 12 to 18 months. That's by far the largest driver of the growth that we're seeing. Those folks have been very successful given - with the tools and infrastructure that we give them to be successful in their sales jobs. And by far, I think that's been the biggest driver. John, do you have any other opinion on that? John Wilson : Yes. I think you hit the nail on the head, Jerry. It's all about having the right amount of people to handle the production of the sales needed to grow those service lines. That only grows by having feet on the street, not by - it's not lead driven, I guess. I'm trying to say like the residential side. So you got to have those bodies in front of those customers. Hans Hoffman : Got it. Thanks. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments. Gary Rollins : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you in February for our fourth quarter earnings. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement disclaimer and then we'll begin. Julie Bimmerman : Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contain certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release, and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. John Wilson : Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that, Rollins closed out last year with continued strong revenue growth and solid financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we report revenue improved 10.2% to $661 million, and net income improvement of 26.1% to $84 million. For all of 2022, we achieved revenue growth of more than 11%, with net income improving as well. Jerry and Ken will provide greater detail, but all credit goes to our tremendous team, who continue to overcome many obstacles. As we begin 2023, the company remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that, we're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm also equally proud of the hard-working men and women of our company that continue to drive our growth through great customer service. I'd like to provide my comments on our 2022 fourth quarter performance. Ken will then address the financials in more detail in a moment. Reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies, Rollins delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, highlighted by total revenue growth of over 10% in the fourth quarter, and over 11% for the full year. Operationally, we have strong momentum in our markets. The company remains well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives, and we're seeing solid levels of growth in the business. As many of you are aware, Rollins has a long-standing company-wide focus on personal safety. Complementing our existing guidelines and protocols we continue to implement new initiatives designed to empower our employees and enable an accountable, safety-driven culture. First training remains crucial for keeping our customers out of harm's way. Second, we're updating incentive metrics and our compensation programs to emphasize safety down to the branch level. A branch manager's bonus plan will now have stronger ties to safety metrics for their operation. We're also working on a new employee-level program to incentivize the highest levels of safe-driving behaviors. We began to pilot this program later this year \u2013 or we plan to pilot this program later this year for our 10000-plus drivers at Rollins. We believe these initiatives will help ensure our workforce returns home to their family, safely each and every day. Looking closer at the financial results and the growth we delivered. Organic growth came in at 6.9% compared with 7.8% for the full year. While still strong, we realized slower growth in the residential sector. While market data indicates this to be consistent across the industry, we started 2023 with strong residential revenue performance in January. While a month is not a long-term trend it was good to see solid demand to start the year. We also continue to succeed in our other service lines particularly within our termite and ancillary, which grew 15.4% year-over-year. Rollins remains very well-positioned to drive ancillary growth within this business. We've taken on the responsibility to educate homeowners on termite prevention and treatment along with other ancillary offerings. And from the customer perspective these service offerings are from a trusted partner. We remain focused on driving revenue growth from cross-selling activities across our large and growing customer base. Our team continues to do a tremendous job here. Our commercial line has also presented a strong year for us with 10.3% growth over the prior year. The sales teams continue to perform very well on both locally sold and national account sales efforts across all our commercial brands. We're seeing strong results in this area with solid performance with customers in the retail, restaurant and office building segments. Across all the service lines I just discussed, a key driver of growth is pricing. During 2022 in light of the ongoing inflationary challenges, we brought forward our annual price increase program to earlier in the year. In 2023, we are bringing this forward even earlier. Most of these price increases will be initiated beginning in early March and some were already implemented in January. Furthermore, our non-Orkin brands are ramping up their focus on pricing the value of our services. Additionally, all our brands are increasing their rate cards. We expect the inflationary environment to persist into 2023 and are focused on managing the price/cost equation. Acquisitions remain a major focus as we start 2023. During 2022 we successfully completed 31 acquisitions representing a total of $119 million invested. This compares with 39 acquisitions and $146 million invested in 2021. While we successfully completed four acquisitions during the fourth quarter we proactively remain on the sidelines during the last few months of 2022 and turned our attention to 2023 deals in our pipeline. We're very optimistic about what's in store for the New Year as leveraging strategic acquisitions remains a focus of our growth strategy. Next, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive efficiency. As part of this we continue to leverage technology by adding a number of new applications to our portfolio of brands. For example, building off our successes with routing and scheduling technology at Orkin and Western Pest Services, we're rolling out routing and scheduling technology initiatives at Clark and HomeTeam. Each of these brands are making meaningful progress at improving efficiency. Clark expects to be at full utilization by the end of this quarter and is very excited about the results to-date. Robert Baker Clark's President went so far as to comment that this initiative is proving to be the best thing for Clark in many years. HomeTeam should complete their implementation and be at full utilization by the end of the second quarter. Both brands have seen an improvement in their on-time delivery metrics since implementation started. In addition to enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner, we found these initiatives can meaningfully reduce both our overall mileage between service visits and drive time for the technician. Not only does this lower our fuel requirements it also has a direct impact on our labor costs. With that, I look forward to answering your questions in a few moments. However, before I turn the call over to Ken I want to emphasize that our team at Rollins had a successful year in 2022 and we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in our business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Krause : Thank you, Jerry and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter and finish to the year. Let me start with a few highlights. First, revenue growth was healthy with total revenue growing approximately 10% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. Acquisitions drove 3% of revenue growth in the quarter and for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunities that will enable us to continue to drive growth through acquisition in the quarters and years to come. Second, quarterly adjusted EBITDA margins were a healthy 22.1%, up approximately 180 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We saw strong results throughout the income statement. GAAP earnings per share were $0.17, up from $0.14 in the same period a year ago. It was good to see the strong growth in earnings on the healthy revenue growth. And last but not least, quarterly free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 20% versus the same period a year ago. We finished off another strong year with free cash flow growing over 16%. Let's look at the quarterly results in more detail. Quarterly revenue was $661 million, up just over 10% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced quarterly revenue growth by 70 basis points on the stronger dollar notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. Quarterly revenues were strong and it was good to see healthy growth across all of our service lines. Turning to profitability. Gross profit was 50.5% of revenue in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. We saw a good performance on gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. Pricing remains at the top of our agenda and we are evaluating opportunities to implement further price increases in the first quarter of 2023. For the year, we saw elevated costs associated with casualty reserves up $12 million for the year with $10 million of that in the third quarter alone. We discussed these charges with you back in October and continue to focus on implementing a number of key programs that Jerry mentioned previously, that are aimed at improving in this area. Additionally, people costs, most notably medical costs, were up about $7 million for the year. We saw higher costs in this area throughout the year. This wasn't necessarily as impactful in the quarter but was something that gradually got worse throughout the year. SG&A expense in the quarter was $191 million or just under 29% of revenues, up $3 million from the prior year, but improving 230 basis points when stated as a percentage of revenue. It was good to see the improvements in SG&A as a percentage of revenue to finish the year. While lower advertising expense due to timing drove 120 basis points of the leverage, it was good to see cost control carried across a number of categories. Management of SG&A represents a key focus area of ours as we start 2023. At just under 30% of revenue, we feel there are opportunities to drive improvement. Stay tuned on this front but know we are focused on taking action that will help improve performance in this area in years to come. Looking closer at profitability. We did not have any non-GAAP adjustments to operating income or EBITDA this year. GAAP operating income was $120 million or 18.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.1%, up a strong 180 basis points over the prior year adjusted EBITDA margin. As I indicated previously, we did not have any adjustments this year to EBITDA margin. If you recall, we adjusted the prior year quarterly EBITDA margin by the impact of the non-recurring SEC matter. As we discussed on the last call, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. In the quarter, on an as-reported basis, we generated incremental adjusted EBITDA margins that we're approaching 40%. When you take out the lower advertising spend I mentioned previously, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30% for the quarter. And even with incurring the higher casualty charges in the second half, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins for the second half were approaching 30%. This is certainly good to see. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $84 million or $0.17 in adjusted earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong to finish the year. We generated $116 million of free cash flow on $84 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 20% in the quarter and was up a very healthy 16% for the entire year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash was well above 100% for the quarter and the full year. We made acquisitions totaling $9 million and we paid $64 million in dividends during the quarter. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We were in a net cash position to finish the year. Year-to-date we have made acquisitions totaling just over $119 million and paid dividends of approximately $212 million. Debt balances are down $100 million since the beginning of the year and cash is down $10 million finishing at $95 million at the end of 2022. We are actively evaluating options to refinance our credit facilities that are set to expire in April of 2024. We expect to make progress on this in the first quarter. Also during the quarter, we corrected immaterial misstatements in the financial statements. Our press release and our 10-K that we expect to file later today will include more information on these changes. But in summary these are non-cash-related items that reduced what we originally reported for earnings by an immaterial amount. By making this change historical earnings increased by $0.01 per share per year. Let me repeat we understated historical reported earnings by $0.01 per share per year. The immaterial changes are related to purchase accounting for acquisitions. The short of it is that the company allocated too much of the acquired asset value to amortizable intangible assets in the past and this adjustment corrects for this. In closing, our fourth quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust and we are very well positioned to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is very healthy and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us very well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry for closing remarks. Jerry? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Jerry, Ken, John, Julie good morning. Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning. Kenneth Krause : Good morning. Julie Bimmerman : Good morning. John Wilson : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : Just a couple of quick ones for me. So your SG&A as a percentage of sales, it was below 29% in the fourth quarter and it's been coming down every year by a couple of call it 10, 20, 30 sometimes 40 basis points every year. But the fourth quarter below 29% that was below what most folks were anticipating and what we'd typically see from you guys. Are there deliberate cost savings programs happening here, or is it primarily just the leverage that you would expect to get on higher volumes and the savings from advertising expense? What I'm trying to get at is, there was a surprise here at the level of cost savings that you had and you had a nice EBITDA beat primarily because of it. Is it fair to expect to see continued leverage on your fixed costs like this as we move through 2023, or would you expect maybe them to come up a little bit as you layer investments back in the business? Thank you. Kenneth Krause : Thanks for the question, Tim. This is Ken. I'll take this question. But I would agree with you. We had really good performance in the fourth quarter with respect to our cost control programs and SG&A. As I'd indicated in my prepared commentary, we had an advertising benefit of about $7 million. So that's about 120 basis points of the improvement. However, we certainly continue to look at a number of opportunities to continue to improve our cost structure going forward. We certainly did leverage it with the higher growth rates that we were able to deliver in the quarter, but we also are very actively evaluating and continue to contemplate cost changes and cost reduction measures across our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, Tim, this is Jerry. Since Ken's been here it's one of the hot topics on his radar screen is our SG&A and how can we get better and how can we improve and Ken has challenged us and brought that equation to the table. And as you know we're always looking to get better. And so we're -- and Ken's finding some ways to help us do that. Tim Mulrooney : Ken's cracking the whip? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Thanks Jerry, and thanks Ken. One more just a question on pricing. I mean it sounds like you're pulling forward the pricing increases even earlier this year which was surprising. But how should we think about that level of pricing increase? I know it was higher than historical levels last year, which makes sense. But with the consumer outlook may be a little bit murkier as we turn the corner into 2023 I'm curious how you're thinking about the level of pricing this year. Do you expect it to be more in line with the historical average, or still above that historical average level? Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : So, Tim this is Jerry. So on the -- really on the Orkin side, we are looking to very similar levels to what we did in prior year, where we've actually gotten more aggressive in our other brands than we were at prior year. So if anything on the whole the net result of that is what we expect is better performance out of pricing going forward in 2023. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is on the residential side. You talked about some pretty good improvement in January. I was just wondering if you can talk about what's really driving it. Is it driven by better execution? Can you talk about how you're better using technology and other tools to improve the residential growth in 2023? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : We -- you got to keep in mind that as we wound down 2022 November, December, we reduced marketing -- some of our marketing spend or advertising spend in the back half of the year and so that softened the end of the fourth quarter of last year. And we began turning our advertising and marketing efforts back on in January. Across the board, I think, we had pretty good weather. We had a pretty good business environment. We had a lot less of the impact of COVID than we did the prior year in January. It was just an overall better environment not necessarily something about technology or anything along those lines. It was just an overall better environment that helped with demand. I don't know John you have anything to add to that? John Wilson : Only maybe staffing. We were better staffed and a better staff position. Part of that's related to COVID. Jerry Gahlhoff : Post-COVID, yes. John Wilson : We were really racked with people out sick with COVID in January a year ago. And so this year we were better positioned to handle the opportunity that we had. Ashish Sabadra : That's great. And then maybe just a broader question on organic growth. If we look at over the last three years organic growth has improved materially compared to the pre-pandemic level. And so as we look into 2023, but also with the mid-term not looking from a guidance perspective but just as we think about the organic growth trajectory, should we think about it more being in line with the recent history particularly the organic growth being more in line with the recent history? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : As you know, Ashish, we don't provide guidance. However, we do -- when we do look at our business I think we all know that this is a very attractive market with attractive growth opportunities. And if you look at the business over the long-term and eliminating some of the fluctuations and volatility that you saw during COVID and recovery from COVID, this market has the opportunity to continue to grow at that mid to high single digits. So we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow our business over the long term at that mid to high single-digit sort of growth rate all the while continuing to be very active on the acquisition front. Kenneth Krause : We have no intention to take the foot off the gas and slow it down. So our goal is always to try to get better and maintain or beat those rates year-over-year. So that's our aim. We're going to keep going. Ashish Sabadra : That's great. And congrats on a solid quarter. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Hans Hoffman : Hi. This is Hans on for Stephanie. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just wanted to dig in a bit more on the resi business in Q4. Obviously, realize a bit slower growth there and in your prepared remarks you kind of referenced it's kind of been consistent across the industry. I just wondered if you could talk about some of those trends in the industry more broadly? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : The main data point that we look at is we can get information from for example, search engines like Google, where they can report \u2013 they report to us the volume of category searches. So for example, the number of people searching for the category or words like pest control. And those were down \u2013 I think Julie, I think \u2013 I remember the number was in the 15% range is what we heard across the industry. The category search was down around the 15% mark. So that seems \u2013 it appears to be across the board. And those are data that we get from companies like Google. Hans Hoffman : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just maybe I want to dig in a bit more on sort of cost inflation. Could you talk a bit about what you're seeing \u2013 where you're seeing cost inflation a bit more sticky in your business and then maybe where it's moderating a bit? And then just kind of your ability to price in excess of cost inflation given some of the pull forward in pricing for 2023? Kenneth Krause : Yes certainly. When we look at the business, there's two or three broad buckets of costs. There's people, there's materials and then there's fleet. And when we look at the business, we started to see gradual improvement in fleet as we move throughout the year. The pressures that we felt earlier in the year when oil was much higher than where it is currently, started to abate as we went throughout the year. The one point that was good to see for us as we finished the year was actually improvements in materials and supplies. And so the second category of costs that I spoke about materials and supplies was certainly \u2013 it was helpful to see some improvement as a percentage of sales to close the year out in that area. And last but certainly not least, our people costs, we continue to manage that very closely. It's a challenging market. Our focus is on hiring the best and the brightest, retaining and providing the tools that will continue to drive that high level of engagement across our workforce that in turn results in that high level of customer service that we're known for. And so we're continuing to manage the inflationary pressures. And that's part of the reason why Jerry spoke about our intent and desire to pull forward the pricing. We're trying to stay ahead of the inflationary cycle that we're all feeling and trying to pass along that price and price our \u2013 the value of the services that we're providing to our customers. Jerry Gahlhoff : And Ken, while the fleet is \u2013 we're seeing some improvement largely driven by fuel. Where we haven't seen any relief is in repairs and maintenance. The cost of replacing just a single tire remains sky high. Basic service on a vehicle is \u2013 continues to climb. And we've just got no relief there. That's one element within fleet. But as Ken said, on the M&S side, we've got those margins back in line. Our teams have fought to help us do that in the procurement side. Those have seemed to have come back to normalized levels. So that's good news for us. Hans Hoffman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Davies : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just firstly, just what are you seeing in terms of the international markets that you operate in? And is growth kind of higher or lower out in those markets than it is in the US? Kenneth Krause : Those markets continue to be very attractive for us. We continue to grow our business. And in fact last year we made significant acquisitions in the UK market. We build out our platform of businesses and services that we're providing in the UK because we view that as a very attractive market. We'll continue to deploy capital internationally, but I have to remind you also that the US is our largest market it's our fastest growing market and it's highly fragmented. So it provides us tremendous amount of growth opportunities as we go forward. So we're pretty bullish, we're pretty optimistic and we feel like we've got a great growth plan that spans the globe. Oliver Davies : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess on the termite side, I'm assuming a decent amount of that grows from ancillary sales. So what are you seeing on just the termite business? Kenneth Krause : We don't break out the termite business from the ancillary, so it's hard to report that. But what I would say is we continue to see demand for the termite business. A lot of people look at the non-residential -- or the residential housing market and get concerned about a slowdown in new housing starts and such. And while we are managing through the challenges associated with higher interest rates, we're seeing good growth come through that business. Jerry Gahlhoff : And we have great performance driving the sales of our termite baiting programs to customers as well. We very good take rates on that. It's got very high customer retention and we try to make sure we bundle that with all our service offerings. Oliver Davies : Thanks so much. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Brian Butler : Good morning. Can you hear me? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah, we can. Brian Butler : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the organic growth. Can you provide maybe some color on how much maybe was cross-selling versus price and how that opportunity for cross-selling looks going into 2023? Kenneth Krause : It's hard to parse it down into that level of detail. But what I can tell you is when we look at the overall growth rate of roughly 10 or so percent, you back off just over 3% of that for acquisitions so you arrive at about 7% or so of total growth. As Jerry indicated, last year we pulled the price increase forward a bit. So we actually saw a little bit more of pricing not only from pulling it forward, but because we were passing along a higher pricing -- price inflation to our customers. And so if you -- if -- we had talked previously about passing along roughly a 4% price increase, we probably realized something in the 2% to 3%. So you could see that our underlying real growth rate is in that 4% to 5% is what we estimate. And it's just an estimation, but that's what we're estimating that our underlying growth rate is without price. Jerry Gahlhoff : And in terms of the opportunity to continue to drive cross-sell through the business at this point the upside looks endless. We have plenty of customers, but we still haven't touched to add our mosquito programs too as well as any of our -- any host of our ancillary service offerings. So when we look at the percentage of our customers with multiple services with two or more services, three or more services that percentage is still low enough that we have a long runway to continue to sell through. John Wilson : And Jerry if I may add as it relates to cross-selling, a critical aspect of that is being well-staffed in both your sales management arena and your sales team. And currently we are well-staffed. That's why we believe that cross-selling will continue to increase. Without the staff you can't -- you're having to offer those services proactively. And so without a staff out there to do it, it just doesn't happen. Jerry Gahlhoff : That's a good point, John. And we do continue to ramp up our sales staffing, even in our 2023 plans are to continue to ramp up our sales team volume to be able to handle, and be out there talking to our existing customers about adding services to their programs. Brian Butler : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then when you think about that pricing kind of pulling it forward again in 2023, how much \u2013 I mean, I think you stated it was fully offsetting inflation? So does that continue to drive those incremental margins of 30% through 2023, or is it even better than that? Kenneth Krause : We're hopeful that \u2013 I mean, we've got a number of levers that we're pulling to continue to maintain our margin profile. Pricing is only one of them. And so we are optimistic about our ability to continue to drive margins. We're not committing to necessarily a specific margin target, but we do see an opportunity to continue to improve our margin profile over the long term. Brian Butler : Okay. And if I could slip maybe one last one. On the M&A kind of rollover into 2023, any color on what's already embedded in there from deals that you closed in 2022? Kenneth Krause : The only thing, I would say, there is 2022, as you know is a little bit of a light year for us with respect to acquisitions. If you go back to 2020 and 2021, we spent almost $150 million each of those years on acquisitions. This past year, we spent \u2013 just about $120 million. So you could see that the rollover may not be at or above 3% like, it has been the last couple of years, it might be slightly lower than that. But what I \u2013 what we've reiterated in our prepared comments is we are incredibly active with respect to acquisitions. And so we continue to go after and court opportunities across the country across the world. And so we continue to be very active on this front. Stay tuned on this front, because it's an area that Jerry and I are spending a lot of our time. Brian Butler : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for final comments. Julie Bimmerman : Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we appreciate your interest in our company. We will be filing our 10-K with the SEC later today after the close of the market, and we look forward to updating you in April on our first quarter earnings call. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. John, would you like to begin? John Wilson : Yes, thank you Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm pleased to report, Rollins delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by revenue growth of over 11%, and earnings per share growth of 20%. I want to begin by welcoming P. Russell Hardin as Rollins newest board member. Russ was elected to our Board at our recent shareholder meeting, and has served as President of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation since 2006. He serves as a Director of Genuine Parts Company, as well as a trustee of the Northwestern Mutual Company. Hardin practiced law with the firm of King & Spalding, and as a long-time resident of Atlanta, has served this community in ways too numerous to list. Please help me welcome Russ Hardin.  Now turning to the Fox Pest Control acquisition, I'm very excited about this recent event. Enjoying a strong reputation in the marketplace, we have long respected Fox's history of success. In fact, I have a relationship with one of their founders, Mike Romney, going back close to 20 years, as Mike began doing summer sales programs for Orkin prior to co-founding Fox. Fox Pest Control was formally established in 2012, initially marketing through the door-to-door sales effort in historically underserved pest control markets. Through consistent growth and expansion, Fox now provides general pest control services for homeowners from 32 locations in 13 States. Fox evolved in their growth strategies to include other streams, as now about a third of their customers are acquired through digital channels. Not only does Fox rank as the 13th largest pest management company, according to the PCT 100 rankings, Fox also received recognition in 2021 by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing private companies in America. In many of the markets they serve, Fox is a market leader with a great service reputation. I cannot stress enough what a great addition this is to our family of brands, and I'll now hand the call over to Jerry to recap Rollin's first quarter results, and talk about the transaction in greater detail. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Our partnership with Fox was an 18-month process. As we worked on executing this transaction and learned more about the Fox business, we became increasingly impressed with their culture, their consistent and strong growth rates, and their unique operating model. In early April, I had the opportunity to visit with many of the fantastic team members at Fox, and was able to witness firsthand the deep pride they have in the Fox brand. Additionally, as Ken will cover in more detail later, we believe the financial benefits are very compelling. We expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first full year of ownership, and will provide meaningful long-term financial benefits as well. We also believe the complementary nature of their brand creates opportunities for enhancing Rollins's strategic platform for growth in the residential space. While still operating under the Fox Pest Control brand and being led by co-founders Mike Romney, and Bryant White, we see incredible potential for the teams at Fox and HomeTeam to learn and share with one another. There are multiple benefits to tying Fox closely with HomeTeam, who have also been utilizing door-to-door campaigns to activate Taexx customers in their predominantly residential business for over 20 years. Furthermore, this alliance will provide HomeTeam with an ability to scale markets faster while we provide the team at Fox with new service offerings and cross-sell opportunities along the way. We're also particularly excited about the strong alignment of their culture and the value the partnership creates for customers, team members, and to our shareholders. Fox has a passionate sense of community and a values-driven approach that consistently delivers quality service, coupled with the resilient track record of strong customer growth and solid employee retention. As we've demonstrated in the past, acquisitions are a key part of Rollins's growth strategy. Over the years, we've built a very successful playbook for their smooth transitions into our company, and we are extremely excited about our path ahead with Fox. In summary, we are confident that Fox's business perfectly aligns to our strategy for sustainable profitable growth, and I'm incredibly proud to add them to our impressive family of pest control brands.  Transitioning to our recent financial performance, I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment, but I'd like to highlight three key areas of progress in the quarter. First, we delivered 11% revenue growth. What was especially encouraging was our organic growth. Organic growth was more than 9% for the quarter, with strong growth across all major service lines. Secondly, margins were very healthy to start the year. We delivered approximately 32% incremental margins and grew GAAP earnings per share 20%. The focus on pricing, selling new business, and productivity is paying off. On our year-end call, we discussed our intention to initiate an earlier price increase this year, and that certainly helped us, particularly in March. We'll continue to focus on this area to ensure that we are effectively pricing the value of our essential services. And last, but not least, we reported strong growth and cash flow for the quarter. We remain well positioned to continue to invest in acquisitions, and maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As we move into spring and summer months, we expect a good business environment and strong demand for our services when you consider recent weather patterns resulting in wet outdoor conditions. April is off to a favorable start, and our teams in the field are well staffed and trained as we head into our traditional peak season. We're also continuing to add to our sales force and emphasizing bundling of multiple services like pest and mosquito through our call center operations. I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins\u2019s strong first quarter performance. And looking ahead, we remain well positioned for 2023 and confident in our ability to continue to drive strong operating results.  I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Krause : Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The team delivered a strong start to the year. Let me begin with a few financial highlights for the first quarter of 2023. First, we delivered over 11% revenue growth in the first quarter, with robust growth across all our service offerings. Acquisitions drove approximately 2% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. We expect to see meaningful improvement in growth from acquisitions for the remainder of the year, stemming from the acquisition of Fox we announced earlier this month. Second, our continued emphasis on margin improvements drove 130 basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins in the quarter. I will speak about incremental margins shortly, but as Jerry indicated, they were a bright spot. GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.18 per share. And last, but not least, we delivered a 15% improvement in operating cash flow, and a 17% improvement in free cash flow. Let's look at the quarterly results in more detail. Starting off with revenue, it was $658 million, up just over 11% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced quarterly revenue growth by 60 basis points on the stronger dollar, notably versus the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the Australian dollar.  Turning to profitability, we realized 30 basis points improvement in gross profit margin. Gross profit margins were 50.3% of revenue in the quarter. We saw good performance on gross profit, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We were more consistent in raising prices across all of our brands this year. We discussed our intent to do this on our year-end call, and it was good to see the impact of the steps we took on revenue and profitability. Looking at four major buckets of costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies, and insurance and claims. These comprise approximately 90% of cost of services in the quarter. We saw improvements in margins associated with people costs, as well as fleet costs. Material and supplies were neutral to margins, while insurance and claims were a headwind to margins. We delivered improvements in SG&A expense as well. SG&A improved 40 basis points when stated as a percentage of revenue during the most recent quarter. Let's dive into the major categories of SG&A a bit more. People costs, advertising and selling costs, and insurance and claims, make up a majority of our spend in SG&A. Margins benefited in the people cost area. Advertising and selling-related costs were relatively neutral to margins, while insurance and claims was a headwind to margins. As the case in the prior year, we expect to see SG&A tick up slightly in Q2 as we invest more heavily in customer acquisition-related costs across the business during the start of our more busy season in the second quarter. We do not have any non-GAAP adjustments to operating income or EBITDA this year. GAAP operating income was $112 million or 17.1% of revenue, increasing 130 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin was 21.2%, up a strong 130 basis points over the prior year EBITDA margin. As I have consistently indicated, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning, what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of approximately 32% in the most recent period. Quarterly GAAP net income was $88 million or $0.18 in an earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated $93 million of free cash flow on $88 million of earnings. Free cash flow increased by over 17% in the most recent period. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash, was also a bright spot, coming in and above 100% for the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling $15 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. Debt remains negligible, and debt to EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We closed and announced the Fox acquisition earlier in April. We are excited about the strategic growth opportunities this acquisition will provide us. A few financial details. We expect this acquisition to add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue in 2023. The acquisition should add $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA for the remainder of the year. We used a combination of existing cash balances and borrowings to pay for this strategic acquisition. We continue to be very active in pursuing additional acquisition opportunities. We expect the Fox acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first full year, with more meaningful contributions to EPS during the latter part of this year and into the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, and we'll provide an update on this on our Q2 call in July after we complete that process. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facilities that were set to expire in April of 2024. We closed on our new facility before the banking crisis in March, and we were able to successfully secure a more modernized facility, that, in addition to other benefits, provides us with the opportunity to incorporate sustainability metrics into the revolver in the future. Additionally, we conducted an RFP for our external audit service provider, and engaged Deloitte as our new auditor in place of Grant Thornton, who had been our auditor for the previous 19 years. We are making good progress on a number of general financial housekeeping issues that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. We remain very well positioned to continue to fund our dividend and grow through acquisitions. In summary, our quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust, and we are very well positioned to continue to use our strong balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is healthy, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We are happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Jerry, John, Ken, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask about the strategic rationale on Fox, but you guys did a great job about that in the prepared remarks. So, I think I'm going to skip that and just jump to the strong organic growth. The commercial pest business, that organic growth was basically double what we were expecting in the first quarter, and that's a significant margin of error, particularly for a predictable business like yours. So, is there anything you can highlight here? Large customer wins, new programs you've established, a pick-up in cross-selling, anything you can highlight as what contributed to that unexpected strength in that commercial piece? Jerry Gahlhoff : Tim, this is Jerry. To me, it's pretty simple. It's about the investments we've made in hiring and staffing on the commercial side, the commercial front with our commercial account managers. We have a considerably larger staff than we did even a year ago and far more than we did two years ago. So, their efforts feed on the Street every single day. Bringing new business in at the volume they're bringing in, that's what's making the difference. It's not about individual wins or big customers or anything like that, it's the collective efforts of everything that they've done. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Sounds broad-based. Thank you. And then just switching gears from organic growth to capital allocation, I mean, now that you've already spent more than $300 million already in 2023, should we expect a slowdown in M&A spend for the remainder of the year? Or are we still going to see you acquire 30 to 40 bolt-ons that you normally do in a given year? And can you also discuss your plans for that leverage ratio? I mean, do you intend to drive it back to zero over the next several years like you typically do, or might we - are we potentially looking at a different capital structure at Rollins on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, so, Tim, this is Jerry. I'll handle the first part of that. We'll continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions, bolt-on acquisitions. We'll continue that path, and of course, continue to evaluate even larger acquisitions if they're there for us to get and the timing is right. But at the same time, we're also fairly cautious. We like to ensure that what we've - the most recent deal is handled well and our time and attention and focus is put on that to make sure that goes smoothly, that transition goes smoothly. We don't want to jump in anything with too much of a distraction for our team or for them in the short run. So, we're probably a little bit cautious there on really large deals in the very short term, but we'll continue to do the bolt-ons. And I'll let Ken address the question about capital. Ken Krause : Sure. Just adding on to what Jerry had mentioned, the integration efforts are certainly really important to us. And so, we want to make sure that we integrate these businesses as much as we can, while not disrupting the customer-facing aspect of these businesses, which are so strong. From a debt to EBITDA perspective, Tim, I believe you were asking, when we look at our capital structure, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet. It does not mean that we're going to lever up two or three times to go after transformational acquisitions. We, quite frankly, don't need to. The business is so strong, but what we will do is use our balance sheet in a strategic manner to grow this business. And so, that's the focus. I can't commit to a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, but what I can tell you is, we will remain very much investment grade. We will very much remain to the playbook that we've executed for a very long time, which has certainly paid off for our investors. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question, Stephanie. Harold Antor : Good morning. This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. Last quarter, I know you reduced marketing spend for the quarter year-over-year. How did marketing spend track this quarter and how is it tracking for 2Q \u201823? Thank you. Ken Krause : Thank you, Harold. I appreciate the question. This is Ken. I had mentioned in my prepared comments that advertising and marketing-related costs were relatively neutral to margins. So, that means that we were spending at just about the rate of growth of revenue in the first quarter. With that said, as we enter the second quarter, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in customer acquisition-related cost. And so, as we go into the second quarter, it's important for us to procure those new customers, which have an incredibly valuable long-term relationship with our business. As you know, approximately 80% of our business is recurring. And so, it's important for us to go after and get those new customers into the fold. And so, we'll continue to tick that up in the second quarter, as we have in past years. And so, I think that's an important point to remember as you think about modeling out, say, the second and third quarter of the year. Harold Antor : Thank you. That'll be all. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Paige from RBC. Please proceed with your question, David. David Paige : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I'm actually on for Ashish Sabadra at RBC. You mentioned Fox Pest Control, about one-third of the customers are acquired through digital channels. Do you have an outlook for the customer acquisition through digital channels post fully integrated Fox and maybe at HomeTeam, and then overall Rollins? Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : I don't know that we've gotten that deep into the analysis. We want Fox to - we want to make for a smooth transition, have Fox settled into what they're doing. Certainly, they have - the team at Fox has had a - themselves gone through this transition over time, ramping up on the digital side. And we\u2019ll help them and continue to support their efforts to do that, give them some of our expertise and knowledge along the way to help them mature in that area and convert leads to sales and starts and those types of things that we feel like we can help them with over time. But at this point, I wouldn't give you any insight in terms of long-term what that may look like a year from now or two years from now. It\u2019s still premature Ken Krause : What I would add to that, Jerry, is that Fox does a really exceptional job in their marketing efforts, and there might be an opportunity to leverage Fox and the Rollins family of brands. And so, I think that's really important to think about as you go forward. They do a really good job, and we certainly want to leverage all the work that they do across their business to benefit us through this combination. David Paige : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question, Seth. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually John filling in for Seth. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just maybe quickly on the insurance and claims, could you give us some more color on really kind of how the headwind progressed in the quarter, as well as how we should think about the cost going forward this year? Thanks. Ken Krause : Certainly, can do that for you, and appreciate the comments. Insurance and claims has been a bit of a headwind here for a period of time, I believe going back to last year. In the third quarter, we talked about that. This year, when we look at the experience in insurance and claims, there's two aspects to that experience. One are just higher insurance premiums. As you know, we had poor experience last year. And so, unfortunately, we saw that come through with higher insurance premiums in the first quarter. That'll carry through for the remainder of the year. The second part of it is, we continue to see just some unfavorable experience in that area. We're ramping up our focus on behavioral-based safety across the company, and ensuring that we're making the right investments in the areas that'll help improve our performance in that area. But it's an area of focus for the company, and we continue to focus on driving some improvements. Unfortunately, we do feel the negative impact of a tighter insurance market, however. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's great color. Thank you. And maybe quickly, just as we think about the cadence of residential, especially with advertising and customer acquisition spend ramping in the second quarter for the kind of peak season, can you just give us a sense at a high level how you're thinking about the kind of pacing of residential? And would it be fair to assume we could kind of see an acceleration from these levels, or are you thinking more of a kind of steady-state, high single-digit on an organic basis? Thanks. Ken Krause : It's hard to provide an estimate on that as we think about the next quarter or two. However, we feel like the investments we're making in our people, in our technicians and our sales folks, the focus we're making on cross-selling and driving cross-sell and a wider share of wallet with each and every individual customer, is paying off. And we feel very optimistic and bullish about our opportunity to continue to grow our position with our really important residential customers into the future. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, this is Jerry. I would add, we're in a really good position to take advantage of strong demand in the marketplace as it's there. So, we feel strong about our position to be able to capitalize on the potential for growth in the market, so. Operator : [Operator instructions] The next question comes from Grant Slade from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question, Grant. Grant Slade : Hi, Jerry. Hi, Ken. Thank you both very much for the additional detail on the Fox acquisition. It's very helpful. Just a point of clarification, however, if I may. I was just curious, the $18 million to $22 million in EBITDA contribution for this year, does that include the full extent of cost synergies that you're expecting to realize from the deal? Or are there perhaps further synergies we should be expecting in 2024 or later? And I guess if so, the quantum of those and the timing would be helpful, if you're able to share that detail with us. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, thank you for the question. We feel like that's - when we think about synergies and we think about integration as we started the call, we certainly are taking a pragmatic approach with respect to synergies and synergy capture. We do think that this business will be accretive to our margins in the next two to three years. But the first year is all about getting in and trying to understand what makes the business so valuable. We don't want to move too quickly, but we also don't want to move too slowly. But we do feel like that $18 million to $22 million is our best expectation or estimate of what we can deliver on the acquisition this year. Grant Slade : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Aadit Shrestha from Stifel. Please proceed with your question, Aadit. Aadit Shrestha : Hi, good morning. This is Aadit from Stifel. Thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on the strong quarter. So, my first question is just really the Fox Pest acquisition. How should the annual $90 million to $ 100 million in sales, how should that be allocated across the lines of businesses? And what are the drivers that would get you to $100 million versus that low end of $90 million? What are you actually building in? Jerry Gahlhoff : Why don't you handle this, Ken? Ken Krause : Sure. Yes. And so, when we look at that business, the breakdown is highly focused on residential. A large percentage of that business is resi sector. And so, that'll come through our residential segment of our business. We feel like that $90 million to $100 million would probably come into our business very similarly to how our business is reported. So, Q2, you'll see a ramping from Q1, and then Q3 you'll see a further ramping. That's just the seasonality of our business. We feel like there's opportunities to drive some outsized growth there, but I also feel like this $90 million to $100 million is a very realistic estimate, and is reflective of the growth trajectory, strong growth trajectory that the business is already on. And so, we feel like it's very realistic in achieving that $90 million to $100 million this year as we think about the remainder of the year. John Wilson : Ken, if I may add, this is John Wilson, but if I may add, retention is critical. And so, that's why with these acquisitions, we don't go into looking to rock their world and go so carefully on the integration and/or assimilation. But Fox continuing their current path on the way they retain their customers and retain their employees, which is important to keep in those customers, will determine whether we get to the $100 million versus the $90 million. Aadit Shrestha : All right. Thank you for that. And I have a follow-up regarding incremental margins, pretty healthy, 32%. How should we think about it for the remain of the year? Can you maybe exceed that 32% with sort of the pricing actions and the cost-cutting initiatives that you've put in? Plus like, what's the impact of Fox Pest on that? Ken Krause : Certainly. Thanks for the question. If you look at the last nine months, the last three quarters, if you will, going back to the second half of last year, we've consistently delivered an incremental margin that's approaching 30%. So, we feel like we're positioned very well to deliver that 30% sort of incremental margin as we move forward. There's always challenges. There\u2019s always puts, and there's takes, and there might be one quarter where you might be below that, but you might have one quarter where you exceed that. As I said in my prepared comments, the second quarter, you're going to see a little bit more investment in customer acquisition costs. We see an opportunity to go after and get customers that are going to create long-term value for our business. And so, you'll probably see a little bit more investment, a little heavier investment come through in that area as we think about the second quarter, but we feel very good about long-term value creation from those customers that will help us deliver that incremental margin profile of 30 plus percent. Operator : Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to giving you an update at the end of the second quarter on our next call. We'll see you then. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you very much for your participation.",

We appreciate all of you joining us today for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. We posted very strong revenue and earnings growth for both our second quarter and first 6 months of 2023. We continued to deliver solid performance across most -- all of our brands and achieved healthy levels of customer growth. Before I turn the call over to Jerry, I want to comment briefly on the results of our recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control. We closed on the Fox acquisition in April, just prior to the ramp-up of their selling season, and they have performed exceptionally well as they achieved solid growth in the first quarter of our ownership. In addition, we have been pleased with their earnings contribution as they achieved over $2 million of GAAP earnings in the first quarter of ownership. This is inclusive of a $1 million charge associated with our earn-out of the deal. Our transition with Fox has gone quite well, and we're excited to have their great team and the Fox brand as part of Rollins. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of approximately 15% to $821 million. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of approximately 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines. Commercial pest control rose approximately 11%, residential increased over 18%, and termite was up approximately 14% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was healthy, although a little uneven due to pest seasonality. On a month-to-month basis, organic growth was very robust at 10% in May before slowing a bit in June. We're back on a good trajectory now in July, in line with what we saw in May. Importantly, our frontline team member staffing levels are better than we've seen in several years, and that is providing us with an opportunity to capitalize on demand for our services. I'm also quite pleased with the progress we're making this far with the Fox Pest Control acquisition, the second largest acquisition in the history of our company. Taking a closer look, the integration of Fox has gone smoothly over the past few months. The Fox teams are executing and doing very well. The transaction was accretive to our second quarter earnings. This continues to be an exciting, highly complementary addition and we believe the revenue growth achieved this quarter is reflective of the team's focus on execution. The team at Fox was not distracted by the shift in ownership to Rollins and was focused on their customers and growing their business. Making for a smooth transition is a key tenet of our acquisition integration strategy, and our collective teams were diligent about not disrupting these efforts of our frontline team members post close. I'd like to express my thanks to the Fox team and all our teammates that have worked hard to make this happen, and we're very excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Next, we continue to have an enhanced capital structure and a robust acquisition pipeline as we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past, Acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and feel very good about our continued ability to invest in strategic acquisitions while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Another important part of our culture is our dedication to continuous improvement. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. As a result, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. We are currently evaluating several streamlining efforts. Kim will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. In addition to the unrelenting focus on productivity and improving our margin profile, we're also more strongly focused on safety. Our experience was disappointing in this area in Q2 as we continue to see higher settlements associated primarily with auto accidents. This was a $0.01 per share drag on earnings this quarter versus a year ago. We have ramped up efforts to significantly reduce automobile accidents moving forward. Our drivers now utilize an app that begins monitoring driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. This app detects unsafe driving maneuvers, such as acceleration, braking, distractions and speed and then converts these data into an industry-accepted FICO driving score from 100 to 850, with 850 being the best. The data indicate that drivers with scores below 710 are 30% more likely to have a collision than those with higher scores. We're working hard in the field to increase driver safety awareness and get these scores up by coaching and training those with lower scores while recognizing and rewarding those that score the highest. We believe these efforts will help us keep people safe and mitigate negative potential financial impact to our business. On the investment side, we proactively increased customer acquisition-related efforts during the second quarter and strategically invested more heavily on advertising spend when compared with the same quarter a year ago and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. While these costs were a $0.01 drag on second quarter earnings, we saw meaningful opportunities to go after and acquire new customers during the start of the busier spring and summer seasons. Given that approximately 80% of our business is recurring, I want to emphasize that the opportunity for us to attract potential new customers is very important and it's a strategic investment over the long term. To date, we're extremely pleased with our targeted marketing and advertising efforts, which we believe is reflected in our strong organic growth performance for the quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue into the third quarter of 2023. Next, we continue to focus on modernizing our business, our capital structure and our organization. As you may recall, in February, we enhanced our capital structure by refinancing our revolver, increasing it from $175 million in 2 banks up to $1 billion in 8 banks, providing us with investment-grade flexibility. More recently, our approximately $1.5 billion universal shelf facility was declared effective by the SEC. This facility provides additional financial capital and flexibility to the company, and Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy, and we've put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both the support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. As we look ahead to the improvement opportunity in front of us, we're focused on upgrading and realigning key areas in our home office support functions. You've heard us talk about opportunities in this area, and we are evaluating several initiatives as we start the second half of 2023. We believe that driving this type of change will provide opportunities to accelerate our growth goals and enable our home office to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services to our frontline operations. Our modernization efforts are progressing well, but we're not done yet, and we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front later. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken, we're pleased about where our business stands today. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract, hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Krause : Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects strong execution by the Rollins team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered strong revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up approximately 8% in the quarter and to finish the first half. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. The integration of the Fox acquisition is progressing well, and we have a growing sense of optimism around this recent investment. Second, our gross margins were healthy, exceeding 53% this quarter. We were positive on the price/cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.3% was pressured primarily by higher insurance premiums and casualty loss developments on 4 legacy auto cases. Our GAAP earnings were $0.22 per share and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition, adjusted earnings were $0.23 per share. And last but not least, we delivered approximately 16% improvement in operating cash flow while free cash flow was up approximately 18% versus the same period a year ago. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $821 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 30 basis points as the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. Turning to profitability. We realized a 40-basis point improvement in gross profit margin, where we saw good performance on gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We continue to see the benefit of a more consistent pricing discipline across all our brands this year. Looking at our 4 major buckets of service costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies and insurance and claims, we saw improvements in margins associated with materials and supplies as well as fleet costs, while insurance and claims were a headwind. People costs were also somewhat favorable to margins even as we added a significant level of pest control and termite control technicians to support strong demand trends. As Jerry said earlier, staffing levels for our frontline team members are the best they've been in years. This timing sets up well as we see strong customer demand to start the third quarter. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people cost, advertising and selling costs, along with insurance and claims make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. We saw headwinds to margins from higher insurance and automobile-related claim costs, as previously mentioned, there were settlement developments on a few auto claims cases this quarter, and we're seeing higher costs in general for auto insurance and related claims due to inflationary pressures. We continue to invest heavily in advertising efforts in the quarter, and that has helped us go after and capture healthy levels of growth. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $5 million on a pretax basis and were related to purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on this material acquisition. GAAP operating income was $155 million, up almost 15% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $160 million, up almost 19% versus the prior year. EBITDA was $182 million, up over 14% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.2%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $183 million, up over 15% and representing a 22.3% margin. And for the first half, EBITDA margins were just under 22%. It is good to see EBITDA compounding at 16% in the first half. As I have consistently indicated, I'd like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins in line with our overall EBITDA margin. However, excluding the headwinds I mentioned from insurance and auto claim developments and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition incremental margins were accretive to our margin profile. Quarterly GAAP net income was $110 million or $0.22 per share, increasing from $0.21 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $114 million or $0.23 per share. The effective tax rate was 27% in the quarter, up 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher foreign income taxes. We expect the rate to normalize at approximately 26% over the second half of this year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained very strong. We generated $141 million of free cash flow on $110 million of earnings. Quarterly free cash flow increased by almost 18% and is compounding at just under 18% in the first 6 months of this year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted to cash, was also a bright spot coming in well above 100%. We made acquisitions totaling $312 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. That remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We continue to be active in pursuing additional tuck-in acquisitions and remain very well positioned to continue to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As Jerry mentioned previously, we are excited about the strategic growth opportunities that Fox provides. So far, the Fox team and business have exceeded our expectations from a growth perspective and we see continued opportunity and momentum in their door-to-door model. A quick update on financial details. In April, we shared our expectations that Fox would add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue and $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA to our 2023 results. We now expect to deliver financial performance at the high end of both of those ranges. We continue to make progress on a number of general financial housekeeping items that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. Of note, we filed a shelf with the SEC on June 3. This filing allows for up to $1.5 billion of primary securities. And while we have no immediate need for this capital, it provides flexibility for long-term fixed rate financing and other options that complement the bank revolver that we put in place earlier this year. Additionally, the shelf allows the company to work proactively with the family should they decide to divest a portion of their holdings at some point in the future. In summary, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Josh Chan : I wanted to ask about the comments that you made regarding the trends in May and June and July. Kenneth, what do you make of the fluctuation? And I guess, based on that, how do you see the trends going forward? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. This is Jerry. The quarter was a little different than we've seen in the past. If you'll recall, back in April at our call with everyone, we talked about April was off to a really strong start, and it was, and April finished strong. May was good as well. And then we saw a pretty significant shift in and some of the demand, especially in the back half of June where it just slid. We've since gotten some of the data from Google on Google search query data that showed there was a pretty significant decline in the back half of June, and that's really what drove the volume down overall in the quarter. But then right when we got near the end of June, very beginning of July, get close to the 4th of July, it really popped. It just came back again. I think the temperatures rose considerably and the number of unique visitors to our website, just in the first couple of weeks in July improved by over 18% year-over-year. So it was it was a little weird. Normally, you see that kind of seasonality earlier in the quarter, not later, but it was a little different than we've ever seen in the past. Josh Chan : Okay. That's really helpful color, and that makes sense. And then I guess my follow-up, you also mentioned advertising increasing. Certainly, it makes sense to invest in that given your business model. I was just wondering what causes you to ramp up or down the advertising spend. I'm curious what you saw in Q2 that made you decide to do more advertising versus less? Jerry Gahlhoff : Well, when we started, we had good signs in April that the environment was good. And plus, we were staffed for it. So when you're better staffed and you've got the people to service the customers and get the new customers coming in the door, that's when it's there to take there to take advantage of it. And in our business, and if you look at the fiscal year, selling recurring revenue, the earlier in the year, you get it the more revenue you get. And so we just thought the conditions were right. And I think that's worked out well for us as evidenced by the organic growth levels that we saw in the quarter. Kenneth Krause : That\u2019s great commentary, Jerry. Josh. Just one additional item with respect to advertising. If you go back and you look at our results, say, for the fourth quarter of last year, we were conscientious in disclosing that advertising was down. And so what you saw was during the winter season, during the fourth quarter, advertising was certainly lower because demand levels are generally lower. But as you go throughout the year, you generally will see a ramping of the advertising in Q2 and Q3. And before it starts to recede a bit in Q4. So I think we\u2019ll continue to follow that same trajectory when we think about demand season for our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Luke McFadden with William Blair. Luke McFadden : This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. I'm curious, with inflation beginning to ease, is your above-average pricing adding any effect on new customer growth or retention? In other words, are you seeing any pushback or pricing from customer -- on pricing from customers? And how should investors think about pricing more broadly as you head into the second half of this year. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would say we've had a little more pushback than we've had in prior years, but nothing that's insurmountable. It's still early to truly judge as we go through the year and get further into the year, we'll look closer at our rollback data and exclusion data, this really get an effect of what happened and whether or not customers canceled over. We'll have all our metrics as we move through the year. I would say it hasn't, it hasn't been a significant issue for us thus far this year. Now the questions as you move through the year, we watch that further depending on the economic environment. We have to moderate that. Ken will -- our plan is to evaluate pricing towards the latter part of this year once all the data and we'll go from there as we think about a futuristic... Kenneth Krause : Yes, that's correct. But I do I also want to add that we continue to believe that our services are essential. We do believe that there's definitely value in our pricing model. But we are conscientious of price and what impact that has in our customer base. And so we'll continue to monitor that. We'll continue to monitor economic trends, but we won't lose sight of the essential value of our services. So Stay tuned on that. But that's, I think, how we think about it, Josh. Jerry Gahlhoff : That was Luke. Luke McFadden : Great. And if I can follow up just with one more maybe on gross margins here. It looks like gross margins were up 40 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter. We know Fox has pretty high gross margins, just given the nature of that business. How much of that gross margin expansion do you think could be attributed to the contribution from Fox? And can you touch on the other factors just helping to drive that gross margin expansion in the second quarter? I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but -- any further commentary there would be helpful. Kenneth Krause : Yes. It\u2019s Ken, Luke, and I\u2019ll take that question. You\u2019re exactly right. The Fox acquisition is a very valuable acquisition and the gross margin reflects the value on their business model. It is accretive to the overall margin profile of Rollins. But it only contributed about $39 million of revenue in the quarter. So it\u2019s not that meaningful. It did have a positive impact on the gross margin, but we also saw a positive impact across our organic business, primarily through better leveraging of fleet costs, better leveraging of people costs and materials and supplies. It's interesting, when I step back and I look at the fleet cost, you would expect fleet costs to improve with gasoline prices. But the thing I think people are missing at times is the fact that used car prices aren\u2019t as attractive. So when we turn in lease vehicles or when we sell lease vehicles, we\u2019re not seeing as much of a gain as we did last year at this time. So we\u2019re seeing good improvement in our organic business despite that headwind. And we also are seeing improvement associated with the Fox acquisition coming through our gross profit margin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Harold Antor : This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. So you talked about productivity initiatives. So I just want to get an idea of what investments that you're making out of the company becoming a little bit more productive. Kenneth Krause : Yes. I would add -- or I would say to that point, we, like most other companies have a list of a number of opportunities that we continue to evaluate across the restructuring area. We're looking at all areas of the business. And as Jerry had talked about as well as myself, continuous improvement is a big focus of our company. And so when we look at, for example, our home office, we are continuing to look at ways we can enhance and improve the home office, but we're also looking more broadly across the business. So can't give you one specific initiative, but it's really across all of our footprint that we're really evaluating opportunities to improve the business from a productivity perspective. Harold Antor : And then just on the residential deceleration. It looks like resi slowed down. And sequentially on year-over-year. So if you could give us any puts and takes on resi growth, resi organic growth? And how should we think about resi organic growth looking forward to the back half of the year? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. When we look back at the quarter and compare it to other recent quarters, we look at it as though June was a bit of an anomaly. June was a really weird month that affected that. I mean we were \u2013 in April and May, organic growth was in that double-digit range, that we were expecting. And then in June kind of threw us for a loop with what went on there. So we\u2019ve started the quarter out back on track with more in line with what we expected, and we don\u2019t see any signs. Of course, you don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but certainly, we\u2019ll make every attempt to continue to drive higher levels on the organic residential growth side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America. Jason Haas : Just following up on that monthly sales cadence. It sounds like maybe it was some cold spring weather maybe push them sales out into July. I'm curious, in prior years where you've had a cold spring, do you see the business shift into July and maybe even further into August and September? Just trying to think about that 10% organic growth number you started in July, and if there's anything to be cognizant of in terms of the compares, whether they get easier and harder through the quarter in August and September? Jerry Gahlhoff : Again, you think about seasonality, and sorry to say this last quarter was different because normally, when we talk about cooler spring, cooler early summer, that's usually happening in March and April. And usually, it hits. So this quarter, it was just -- it was really different than one I'd say we've seen in many, many years. Now is that to say there's some pent-up demand. We certainly have seen that in July, where once temperatures got to -- I don't know, a few weeks ago, we were in California, Ken, and when we arrived that day, in the middle of the day, it was like 75 degrees. But then by the weekend, it was 110 degrees in Northern California and the phones were ringing off the hook. So it was very -- So we had some very unseasonably cool weather in June, which is kind of an anomaly. So I don't know what else to say... Kenneth Krause : Yes. It's just adding on there. Weather always has an impact across the business. What really helps us to is those warm evenings when evening stay above a certain level, the low temperature doesn't get too low. And so when you see that, you certainly have a benefit in the business. And so it certainly does continue to have a nice positive impact on the business. As we think about comparables, I don't see anything year-over-year that has a huge impact on comparables from a weather or from a revenue performance perspective. Jason. But we feel, as we said in our prepared comments, we feel very good about how we're positioned to deliver a strong second half in 2023. Jason Haas : That's great. And then for a follow-up, I was going to ask on the incremental EBITDA margins. I know you said previously, and we're seeing it play out that the plan was to invest more in some customer acquisition costs. So you're a little bit below the 30% target this quarter. Is that a fair framework? I think you're in the low 20% range or so this quarter. Is that a fair assumption to use for the near term? Or do you think in the next few quarters, you can get back to that 30% level that you target? Kenneth Krause : So it\u2019s interesting, Jason. If you look at the LTM number as of June 30, the LTM incremental margin is 29.3%. So it\u2019s almost 30%. That\u2019s up strongly from the prior year. And so when we look over a long period of time a 12-month period, we\u2019re certainly trending at those levels that we talked about. This one quarter, what we saw in the second quarter, you might see it a bit in the third quarter, is you\u2019re investing. It\u2019s time to invest. It\u2019s time to go after and acquire those customers that you\u2019re going to keep for years to come. And so you see even our incrementals may be weighed down a little bit by that. But the fact that the incrementals were accretive to our actual margin profile that provides me a sense of optimism. We\u2019re in an investment period, and we\u2019re actually still seeing incrementals that are accretive to our EBITDA margin. That\u2019s a good thing to see. And so we\u2019re hopeful that, that will continue as we go into the third quarter. But our goal long term is that 30% incremental margin profile. There\u2019s no reason this business shouldn\u2019t get to those levels based upon the pricing that we get based upon the essential nature of our services, based upon our customer experience that our service technicians and our associates are providing our customers. And so we feel good about that incremental margin target longer term. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo Securities. John Mazzoni : Maybe just following up on this insurance issue. I think you believe you mentioned 4 claims in the quarter and about a 40-basis point drag. Could you maybe just quantify if there's any other kind of legacy settlements in the pipeline that could hit in the future quarters? And also, how should we think about higher insurance costs as we move through the year? Should they maybe step down as the driver safety improves? Or are higher insurance costs more of a function of just the environment we're currently in? Kenneth Krause : Yes. First and foremost, what I would say is our accruals at June 30 are complete and accurate. And so when we look at the liability associated, for example, with auto claims, we feel like it's complete. We do know that things change. And so as facts, as circumstances change, estimates change. And that's what we would do as we move forward. you really started to see this tick up last year in the third quarter. We had around $10 million of claims that came through that settlements came through. And it's interesting when you look at what happened during COVID, claims have certainly -- they've certainly trended down quite a bit, courts closed a bit, settlement activity went down. And then coming out of COVID, you start to ramp. We're hopeful that we'll see that turn down as we go into the future. But you're just not sure what's going to happen on that front. What you can do, however, is focus on the controllables. And what Jerry had talked about in his comments, was focusing on putting systems and processes and the focus behind behavioral-based safety into the business that will mitigate these exposures as we move forward. And so we're doing just that. And we're hopeful that, that activity will have a positive impact on our experience in this -- our unfortunate experience in this area. John Mazzoni : Got it. Great color. And maybe also just following up on this investment period. Could you just quantify the kind of return on ad spend or maybe even at a high level, just your kind of customer acquisition cost at kind of either digital or linear. We've seen kind of a lower TV upfront market and potentially others pulling back. So could that be potential upside if you can get these kind of ad dollars and your customer acquisition costs down. Kenneth Krause : What I would say and I would ask Jerry to comment, too, was if I look at our organic growth profile and I compare it to our overall market growth, our organic growth, as we said in our prepared commentary, is roughly 8%. The markets, what we expect the markets to be growing at are much below 8%. So when we think about the organic growth profile and we think about the share that we are gaining in our markets, we feel good about the return levels knowing that incremental margins can be around that 30% and a customer might stay with us for 3, 5 or even 7 years. So we feel really good about the returns that we're getting on those ad dollars. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. I mean just factor in the lifetime value of a customer and what that customer means to us over the long term as a worthy spends. And we do a very good job of monitoring cost of customer acquisition, cost to lead, and we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019re spending to generate that long-term recurring revenue stream. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel. Aadit Shrestha : This is Aadit Shrestha from Stifel filling in for Michael Hoffman today. So just going to your cash flow, you had a very strong free cash flow conversion in 2Q. Were there any specific factors that influence this in the period? And would you expect the conversion to be like lower in the second half? Kenneth Krause : When we look at the cash flow conversion, we're really happy with the performance that we saw in Q2, but also the first half of the year. Our focus is to continue to drive compounding of free cash flow in that mid-teen range. And the fact that we saw free cash flow compound at roughly 17%, 18% in the quarter, it provides us a sense of optimism heading into the future. I don't know that we're ready to increase our expectations in the 18% or 20% compounding of cash flow. But if we can continue to see compounding of cash flow in that 14% to 15% or so percent, which is in line with what we've compounded cash flow at over the last 20 or so years. I think we would be happy with that performance. Nothing really jumps off the page at me in terms of what's driving cash flow improvement in the quarter. I know the FOX business has a bit of a different business model when you look at the door-to-door side. And so payables stepped up a little bit with respect to that business model, that actually had a positive impact on cash flow. But overall, we feel good about cash flow and we feel good about the generation of cash that we're seeing. Aadit Shrestha : And just as a follow-up. Your largest customer mentioned that the deal valuations have come down as private equity is spending less for deals. Are you seeing a similar trend? And does this drive like an outsized year of deals, excluding the Fox acquisition? Jerry Gahlhoff : Sure. I completely heard or understood the question. Were you asking more about the PE space and what we're seeing from a... Aadit Shrestha : Just overall sort of what multiples are being paid for acquisitions are lower now. That's what they're seeing. And if you're seeing a sort of similar type of trend. And would this sort of mean you do more M&A than usual? Jerry Gahlhoff : I wouldn't necessarily say it's come down significantly. I've seen some PE deals that have transacted at pretty high valuations early this year. I would say there's also been maybe some PE deals out there that haven't made it to closing. So it seems to be it's still a pretty rich environment. It may have softened a little bit, Ken. We measure that pretty closely and kind of watch all of our transactions. I don't necessarily think it means we're going to go more aggressive or try to bite off more than we can choose. We will always remain disciplined about picking the right -- the right acquisitions, the companies with the right culture, the people that care about the business and have the right type of fit for Rollins. And that no matter what the valuation is, that's the biggest thing we look. That's where we start. Ken, what would you add? Kenneth Krause : Yes. The only thing I would add is, I mean, we can speak about our experience. And our experience is we\u2019ve been investing at very healthy multiples, not necessarily aggressive levels we are getting deals at fair values. But it\u2019s interesting. The one thing that certainly has an impact on the M&A markets is interest rates. And as interest rates tick up, ultimately, some buyers value businesses at a much lower level. You just can\u2019t get there with certain levels of interest rates. So that certainly has potentially an impact on the M&A environment. But what Jerry said is spot on. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on buying good businesses, paying fair values and businesses that align with our culture and our focus and value their team members, value their brands. That\u2019s the kind of business we want to bring into the fold, and we feel like we got that with Fox. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ollie Davies with Redburn Partners. Ollie Davies : On the residential side, can you just talk about the split of organic growth between kind of cross-selling into the existing customer base and your ability to add new customers, given the macro environment? Kenneth Krause : The focus on cross-sell, the focus on ancillary is a key part of the strategy. We don't necessarily provide the detailed growth levels for ancillary or for cross-sell or multiple services with any one customer. But what I can tell you is we're seeing really good growth from a number of different services. Like, for example, you might have an individual that signs up for pest control and they're adding mosquito because mosquito demand is incredibly strong or you might see a termite customer or another pest control customer that is signing up for cross space work or insulation work. And so we're still seeing continued good demand for those ancillary and additional services across the business. Ollie Davies : Great. And then as a follow-up, on the commercial, obviously remains very strong. What are the sort of typical types of commercial venues that you're adding at the moment? And do you think this can continue, given, I guess, the kind of historical volume growth that Commercial delivered before the pandemic? Jerry Gahlhoff : We haven't seen any slowdown in our ability to sell and bring on new commercial customers. We are more focused on certain verticals that we really like to sell into -- logistics, health care, hospitality, things along those lines where we try to be pretty fairly disciplined about the customers that we're really proactively targeting. But we have a very effective sales force. We've continued to invest in that sales force and ramp up those sales efforts, and we feel very positively about the future of the commercial business. Operator : And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you on the third quarter earnings call in October. Thanks again. Operator : And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

On the line with me today on speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of over 15% to $840 million. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of over 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines, as Residential increased approximately 20%, Commercial Pest Control rose approximately 12% and Termite was up 11% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was robust following the slower June activity that we discussed on the last quarter. We saw consistent growth in the mid-teens each month of the third quarter. We have observed continued underlying strength in the pest control markets year-to-date, particularly within North America. Additionally, our addressable markets are large fragmented and supported by a number of key secular trends including, but not limited to : one a shift from DIY to do-it-for-me; two, population migration to warmer climates; three, changing weather patterns; and four, the stickiness of hybrid work schedules leading to people spending more time at home.  As we look at our competitive position in these attractive markets, we believe we continue to benefit from several key elements of our business model. If you look back over the last 15 years or so, we've consistently grown revenues through the great recession in 2009 and on through the industrial slowdown in the mid-teens. We reliably grew mid-single digits year-in and year-out. Revenue growth accelerated pre-COVID and that has generally continued. We delivered high single-digit organic growth in each of the last 11 quarters. Let me highlight four key areas that we believe have differentiated us in the market and position us well to continue outpacing a market where secular trends should support mid single-digit growth over the next several years. First, our leading portfolio of pest control companies gives us a unique position in our markets. The combination of Orkin and our strong group of regional brands gives us multiple bites at the apple with potential customers and additional cross-sell opportunities. Second, we use a variety of methods to acquire new residential customers and add to the depth of our relationships with existing customers. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods all help us reach new customers or drive further engagement with existing customers. We also have important relationships within the homebuilding and real estate market communities through brands like HomeTeam and Northwest. We're able to capitalize on this multi-channel approach to drive residential customer growth. Third, we're investing in commercial customer acquisition targeting key strategic verticals that are the most profitable. This is paying off, with 12% growth in the quarter. And last but not least, we have a clarity of focus and have been consistently executing our strategy in our core market for a very long time. This focus and clarity ensures we don't make unnecessary changes and enables us to continue to successfully grow our share in a very attractive pest control market. These points of differentiation have positioned Rollins to achieve a healthy level of organic growth and are further complemented by strategic M&A. Looking at the recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control, the integration remains on track. The Fox teams are executing and doing well and we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Additionally, through the first nine months of this year, we closed 18 tuck-in deals in addition to Fox. The M&A pipeline remains healthy and we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position, while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and are confident in our continued ability to invest in the right strategic acquisitions, while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Our dedication to continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. In August, we took an important step towards increased efficiencies in our Atlanta Support Center to accelerate our growth goals. For the first time in about 20 years, we executed a restructuring program that was designed to support our modernization efforts and flatten our overhead structure. We plan to reinvest cost savings and initiatives that further enable our growth priorities and allow us to serve our frontline operations more efficiently. We continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. Ken will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy and we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing helped us capitalize on continued strength in demand and to achieve high levels of organic growth both in the quarter as well as year-to-date. We remain focused on safety and I'm pleased to report that we have seen our average mentor driver safety score increase over 25% since the beginning of the year. You'll recall that, this driving score is derived from an app that we have implemented to monitor driving behaviors when our vehicles are in motion. Improving the safety culture isn't something that's done overnight, but we are making strides and we're encouraged that our claims activity had less of a negative impact to our financial results versus a year ago. We are working hard in the field to increase safety awareness and training, while recognizing and rewarding those that are the safest. We believe these efforts will keep our people safe and mitigate negative financial impacts to our business. We continue to focus on creating value and returning capital to our shareholders. We're pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend by 15%, and we remain committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. Additionally in the third quarter, we completed $300 million in share repurchases. The moves we made earlier this year in modernizing our capital structure by refinancing and expanding our revolver gave us the flexibility to be opportunistic and participate in a repurchase at a very attractive price. Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Our modernization efforts continue to progress well but we're not done yet. And we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front over the coming quarters. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken we are excited about where our business stands today. We're very well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken Krause : Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins' team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of over 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up over 8%. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth. Second our gross margins were healthy approaching 54% this quarter. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% was strong improving 150 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Our GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share, and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition and severance costs for the restructuring that Jerry just mentioned, adjusted earnings per share were up 27% to $0.28 per share. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $127 million and free cash flow of $121 million, both up slightly versus last year. Cash flows were impacted by the timing of certain payables the payment of payables at quarter end. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $840 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 10 basis points. Organic revenue growth was very healthy at above 8% this quarter, improving from the second quarter levels. We continue to see good demand for our services and our acquisitions, most notably Fox, continue to deliver value in the third quarter. Turning to profitability. We realized a 150 basis point improvement in gross profit margin as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. While Fox was accretive to gross margins by about 30 basis points, we saw 120 basis points improvement in organic margins in the quarter. Setting aside improvements associated with the more favorable claims experience and the contribution of Fox, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in gross margin as leverage from people costs as well as materials and supplies more than offset pressure from fleet due to lower gains on the sales of leased vehicles versus a year ago. We are pleased with our ability to leverage our cost of services provided as we continue to benefit from a more consistent pricing discipline across all of our brands this year. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the earn-out adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people costs advertising and selling costs along with insurance and claims, make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. Margins benefited year-over-year associated with improved claims experience and we saw leverage on our people costs but were negatively impacted by increased advertising and selling expenses as we invested to drive growth in our business. As Jerry mentioned, for the first time in 20 years we executed a restructuring program at our Atlanta Support Center to further support our modernization efforts. Roughly 15% of our back-office employee population was impacted and we intend to reinvest associated cost savings in both people and systems that can drive further change and increase productivity as we work to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services for our frontline operations. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for restructuring costs and for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $10 million on a pretax basis and were related primarily to Atlanta Support Center severance costs along with purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on the Fox acquisition. GAAP operating income was $177 million, up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $187 million, up approximately 29% versus the prior year on 15% total revenue growth. EBITDA was $202 million, up 19% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24.1%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, up over 22% and representing a 24.8% margin. Margins were up 150 basis points versus a year ago primarily related to the improvements in gross margin discussed previously. Fox was neutral to EBITDA margins in the quarter. Year-to-date our adjusted EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points versus a year ago with 20 basis points of that improvement coming from the Fox acquisition. Excluding this, 70 basis points, was driven across the remainder of the business. As we have consistently indicated, we like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of over 29% and excluding the restructuring costs and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition, incremental margins were almost 35%. Year-to-date we generated incremental margins on an as-reported basis of over 27%. And on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 30%. Quarterly GAAP net income was $127 million or $0.26 per share increasing from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $136 million or $0.28 per share. The effective tax rate was approximately 26% in the quarter and for the first nine months the ETR was 26% as well, up over 100 basis points compared with 2022 driven by higher foreign income taxes. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained healthy. We generated $121 million of free cash flow in the quarter versus $119 million a year ago. As previously discussed, quarterly free cash flow was impacted by the timing of certain payables primarily related to our door-to-door sales. Year-to-date free cash flow was $354 million, an increase of 11% versus last year. During the quarter, we made acquisitions totaling $21 million. We paid $64 million in dividends and we completed a share repurchase of $300 million at below $35 a share. We repurchased 8.7 million shares and used our revolver to fund this purchase. We expect this to be less than 1% dilutive to results in the first year and minimally accretive in the second year. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is below one time on a gross and net level. Our strong cash flow profile has enabled us to execute a very balanced capital allocation strategy this year. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions, repurchased $300 million of our shares and paid $192 million in dividends, a 30% increase year-to-date. Additionally we just announced another 15% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This marks over two decades of consecutive increases in annual cash dividend payments. We remain active in pursuing additional acquisitions. And looking at multiples, we remain very disciplined. Year-to-date we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions and the market remains highly fragmented and we continue to be an acquirer of choice and a very active participant in our markets. In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement across the business. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking the question. It's good to see the strong momentum in the business. I just wanted to better understand. Can you -- you obviously talked about multiple different avenues to attract new customers. And -- but I was just wondering, if you could comment on the underlying demand environment. Have you seen any slowdown in the demand environment? And you, obviously, talked about month-to-month being consistently strong but have you seen a better focus on certain selling strategies versus another? Thanks a lot. Jerry Gahlhoff : This is Jerry. Thanks for the question. I think some people think the entire market demand is driven by whatever someone's seeing in digital. And that's not always the case especially for our business. When you look at the digital side, it was relatively flat or maybe even slightly down on the digital side. And that's really where our strategy to have lots of approaches for how we acquire customers plays a differentiating factor for us. So while the digital segment was certainly, I think on the flattish to slightly downside, our diversified strategy is really what's paying off for us. Ken Krause : Yeah. The only thing I would add there just two points. One, the growth across the business is quite impressive. When I look at the business in the quarter, we saw a broad-based growth not only on a quarterly basis we saw consistent growth, but broad-based growth across all of our family of brands. So that was really good to see, first. And second we exited the quarter and went into October, we continue to see a really healthy demand level. And if you might recall, a year ago we saw a lot of business from a really tough hurricane season in September get pushed into October. So to see good momentum into October also gives us a bit of optimism as we think about the future. Jerry Gahlhoff : I think it's also important to mention that what we've seen across say the US and Canada in particular across North America is that all of our businesses are doing well and geographically not only from a brand individual brand strategy, but also from a geographic strategy they're really all doing quite well. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And just maybe on my follow-up I wanted to talk about the solid incremental margins that we've seen of 35%. As we think about the modernization efforts that you've worked on, how should we think about the incremental margins going forward? Is that 30% to 40% sustainable going forward? Thanks. Ken Krause : Yeah, it's a great question Ashish and thank you for that question. What I would say is our focus is to continue to deliver a very healthy incremental margin profile. This quarter, you're correct in saying that we were 35%. We continue to see an opportunity to deliver 30% incremental margins upwards of 35% to 40%, depending on a multitude of factors but we certainly continue to have a confidence level in our ability to deliver a 30% incremental margin and continue to see EBITDA margins lift as we go into the future. It's a great business. It's an essential service. It's got pricing and we're focused on continuous improvement in our \u2013 across our business not just in our back office. So with all those points, we continue to focus on delivering a very healthy incremental margin profile. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color and congrats on the solid quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vicki Lu [ph] with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. This is Vicki on for Jason Haas. To start off I'm just curious have you seen any pushback from the 4% price increase or is it more business as usual as you see? Ken Krause : Price increase has been \u2013 it's been a very healthy environment as what we've seen from a standpoint of price increase. You may see certain zip codes that you might see challenges in but you see other zip codes where you don't see much challenge at all. So \u2013 but overall, we see it as a very healthy environment for our essential services. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you. And then to follow up, do you think your customers can take another price increase on a similar scale in 2024? Jerry Gahlhoff : We're going to \u2013 this is Jerry. We're going to evaluate that. We're here in the fourth quarter when we start really taking a look at our price increase data that results from the last nine or 10 months and say what happened? What did we learn? And create our strategies for next year. And I guess my best advice to you would be to stay tuned. We'll probably update you on that at some point in the first quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Ken, Jerry, good morning. Ken Krause : Good morning Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. So on customer acquisition, Jerry I think in your response to another question, you said the digital channel was kind of flat to down in the third quarter. My question on that is that new? Was it up in the first and second quarters of this year? Just trying to get a sense for how consumer demand in this particular channel has trended through the year? Jerry Gahlhoff : I would characterize it in the first five months of the year as somewhat up. I wouldn't say it was something that \u2013 we didn't see some sort of double-digit increases very consistently. We may have had better \u2013 some better months than others but it wasn't up at a higher \u2013 a significant higher level than prior year. There are ups and downs. And then it was really June is where we saw that almost that double-digit decrease for those three weeks in June that was sort of out of character but then it just rebounded in July. So I would say it's been dynamic and maybe the word is a little volatile over the summer a little bit but then it's now seemed to stabilize pretty consistently over the past few months in terms of flat year-over-year. So I don't know if that helps but I think that's the story of the last nine or 10 months. Tim Mulrooney : No that's extremely helpful. There's a lot of folks out there trying to figure it out on their own and looking at your trends. And so we just hearing it from you directly is very helpful. And I fully appreciate that you have many different channels in which you acquire customers but thanks for the detail on that. The other thing I want to ask about is customer acquisition costs. Customer acquisition costs in the digital channel I know it's risen over time just like they have for everybody \u2013 I'm curious if you're seeing a narrowing I guess in the gap of customer acquisition cost between digital and door-to-door? And if so do you plan to expand the usage of that D2D channel more extensively in future periods? Jerry Gahlhoff : So yes that is something \u2013 that is a trend that we've seen as more and more pest control companies have gotten more mature in the digital space. We have seen say the Googles of the world be able to pass along higher cost to us in terms of \u2013 especially for things like pay-per-click things along those lines. So you see that rise. And I also want to point out just because demand is flat through say Google search data or something like that or it's down 1% year-over-year or something along those lines, doesn't mean you as a company can't perform or take a larger share of that demand through \u2013 we have great marketing teams, certainly at Orkin and throughout some of our other brands as well that do some of the digital activity. And they can achieve more with the dollars spent in that market. But back to your original question, we certainly have seen over time over the last several years an increase in digital cost of customer acquisition that makes that gap between door-to-door and digital certainly narrower, and so when you look at the door-to-door model you think that can be a pretty good model if you sell it right, and especially when you consider the door-to-door is selling you density because they're working neighborhoods and you're picking up a dense more dense populations than say onesie-twosie stuff coming in from all over a metropolitan area on the digital side. So, when you factor the efficiencies that door-to-door bakes in long term even though it's a little bit more money upfront it may be it's a really strong offering from a long-term standpoint as well. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning Jerry and Ken. Congrats on a good quarter. I guess I wanted to ask about the customer acquisition split I guess. You mentioned digital and door-to-door mostly on this call but I guess of the ways that you acquire customers could you just give us like a rough ballpark on how what channels they typically come through in? Jerry Gahlhoff : Got it. You're asking like what percent of customers come through which channel? Josh Chan : Yes exactly. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes we really don't disclose that information. Ken Krause : But I would say that today much larger portion comes through a digital channel or more comes outside of door-to-door then comes from door-to-door. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. There's digital. There's the consumer awareness that makes the phone ring when they call our customer agents where -- they know our brands. They know our name and they call us automatically and never have to go to Google to do a search because they've seen our name phone number they see a vehicle in the neighborhood and they make the phone call, right? So, the word of mouth is still a powerful channel. So, it's really all those things that come into play to drive that but certainly digital is an important part. But we also don't like to over-rely on it as well. And we also think about technician sales. We've put a great deal of emphasis. And one of the things that you learn in this business is when you're not staffed your technicians don't sell. So, if they are -- if they're too swamped with too much work to do they're not going to go out. And when that when somebody down the road talks to them they're going to be a little less hesitant to want to sell that new job because it's just more work for them. But when you're staffed and you're staffed to a healthy levels your technicians get engaged. So, we see increases in our technician sales and their activities as a result of our better staffing levels as well. So, it's all these ways that we can acquire customers. Josh Chan : Right. thanks Jerry. And then I guess on the restructuring side of things is there a way to think about the payback period of the cost? And what kind of savings you expect to generate from those efforts? Ken Krause : Yes, it's an attractive payback, Josh. Thanks for the question. When you look at the spend the $5-or-so million of spend, there's probably close to $8 million to $10 million of compensation associated with that. So, my experience has been a one-year payback is very acceptable. You can see a six-month payback and a spend associated with the restructuring here. With that said, I think if you look at the prepared commentary, we're focused on reinvesting as well. And so there is an opportunity to reinvest in new talent new talent like Lindsey. She kicked off the call today, our new Head of IR, new folks across all of finance and accounting IT, we're making significant changes in as well. And other back-office functions. So, we're looking at how do we upgrade the talent, how do we improve, how do we modernize what we do. And some of that is going to take some reinvestment of that $8 million to $10 million. Josh Chan : Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks Ken. Thank you both for your time. Ken Krause : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Aadit Shrestha : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a strong quarter again. So, what was the internal cost inflation? Is it still predominantly fleet related? And how do we how has this trended actually through the year? And just kind of related to that you talked about price/cost spread it remains positive. I think it was around 50 basis points. How has that trended versus 2Q or 1Q? And how do we think about it for remainder of the year and into 2024? Ken Krause : So, it's Ken. I think I'll take that question. Our focus is to continue to have a positive positively manage the price/cost equation. If you look at the input costs in our business, a large percentage on a cost of services provided are people costs materials and fleet. For the most part, we've done a really good job at leveraging and improving the efficiency over those costs throughout 2023. If I go back to Q2, for example, we saw improvements in margin some of that was related to Fox. We also had headwinds if you remember from the casualty reserve. But when you separate those two, in the second quarter, we saw improved margin similar to what we saw this quarter. What we saw this quarter was outsized improvement associated with the casualty claims and insurance costs. If you go back to last year in the third quarter we were very transparent in talking about a very unfavorable headwind associated with insurance and claims. So, we were able to see improvement from what we saw last year. But our focus is to continue to be positive on the price/cost equation. Really the only headwind we saw in the quarter within our organic cost was in fleet which specifically was related to lower gains on the sale of leased vehicles. We actually talked about that in Q2 and highlighted that we would be seeing some of that here in Q3 we did see it but we were able to fully offset that and see improvements. And so that's the focus continued improvement in margins as we go forward. Aadit Shrestha : All right. Thank you so much. And just as a follow-up I think free cash flow conversion and you pointed out there was sort of a payment -- a big payment make a you brought it down to 94% conversion. I think year-to-date you're tracking around 110% historically it averages around 120%. So do you expect 4Q sort of picks up and you actually get back to that 120% conversion for the year? And how do we think about it long term like beyond 2023 and maybe into 2024 how much more can it improve? Ken Krause : Yes. It's a business that's very capital light. And so when you look at the cash flow profile it's hard to find a business this investing 7% to 8% and working capital has very little CapEx and enjoys the benefits of that and has been compounding cash flow at 10% to 15%. So our focus is just that how do we continue to compound cash flow in that teen range? How do we continue to convert net income and earnings at above 100% of net income. The third quarter had an impact. We saw payables come down considerably. We paid some payables as we closed out the third quarter. And our focus is to improve that as we go into Q4 and beyond. And so that continues to be our focus. We're continuing to focus on driving high levels of cash flow performance and compounding in the ranges I previously discussed. Aadit Shrestha : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Harold Antor : Hello. This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. So I guess a quick question. How did weather trend in the quarter and how the [indiscernible]. And then also in 2021 MAU increase the hiring of sales professionals. So are those individuals are full productivity? And how do that impact on organic growth in the quarter? Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : So on the -- this is Jerry, Harold. On the weather side, we had a pretty good weather quarter. Last year as Ken mentioned we had a hurricane that came through at the end of September it affected south in particular Southwest Florida. So we didn't have that type of event. So I would generally categorize it as favorable. And then as it relates to hiring of salespeople we've been very effective. And when you look at our commercial growth a lot of the investments we've made both in commercial and to some degree certainly the residential side and our termite and ancillary is the result of the effectiveness and the efficiencies that we're getting from a sales productivity standpoint of those sales the sales teams that we've added. And you look at our commercial growth looking back over the third quarter of 2022 we've added over 60 more commercial account managers into the Orkin brand alone over the past year that's really helping us that's an investment we make in the business. It's helping us drive that growth. We see a great opportunity in the commercial space. And those are the investments that we've been making over the last 12 months. Harold Antor : Thank you. And then just on M&A. Given where interest rates are in a certain markets, are you seeing more willing sellers how much TV is in the market? And then I guess for your acquisition strategy are you acquiring more traditional companies or more companies similar to Fox Pest Control that are door-to-door like? Jerry Gahlhoff : We're seeing everything still in the market. Businesses are still owners are still interested in selling their businesses and the pipeline flow remains good and we're open to looking at all types of businesses that fit our model that help us continue the growth pattern that we strive to achieve help us that are accretive to our margins that are going to help us grow in a healthy positive way. So that side of it still seems very positive. What would you add to that, Ken? Ken Krause : Yes. The only thing I would add is pricing which everybody is always focused on what are we paying for acquisitions. Two points I want to raise with respect to that. One is we don't compete on price. Our focus is to be the acquirer of choice. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When people are ready to sell their business and they're focused on brand preservation and their people they sell to our business. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When we look at the business this year we've invested $350 million in acquisitions. I would say that the multiples that we've paid for that $350 million investment is probably below the overall long-term average from a multiples perspective. So we feel good about what we're spending how we're competing and the success that we're driving through acquisition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Mazzoni : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just to double click quickly on the commercial side. Could you maybe just talk more about the target vertical strategy as well as anything on technology that really is accelerating the kind of organic growth profile? And maybe also just \u2013 again, the 60 kind of added reps have been helpful. But just to talk about the kind of sustainability of that growth going forward? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : So, on the commercial side with targeted verticals, we've talked about this over the last few years especially as we are kind of coming out of the tail end of COVID and the investments that we've made there. We know that, our research on our customer database shows there are certain much more highly desirable verticals that we like to sell into and service into and things like hospitality or health care, hospitals, logistics, warehouses, distribution centers not that we don't want everything commercial but we have really targeted our focus on certain verticals. And when we bring on new say commercial account managers at Orkin, we're really getting them focused and targeted on working that type of material and going after those types of customers from a B2B standpoint. So it's really -- I've also discussed some of our tools like Marketo that help us from a -- on a B2B standpoint that have helped us get our outside sales people on the commercial side warmer leads and make them more productive and make them more productive quicker. That's a relationship sell. It takes some time. So we've been very deliberate about that since we started this program, probably midway through COVID seeing this as an opportunity coming once we are on the backside of COVID that would be a great opportunity for us to capitalize on. And we're again a long-term view and a long-term approach to our business and that's -- you're seeing the results and the payoff of that now. So -- and then on the technology side, certainly our marketing teams in particular when we talk about accelerating organic growth there are technologies. There's campaigns that we run where we're using technology where we're using some automation. The marketing teams are certainly innovative looking at strategies along those lines. I don't like to get into specifics, but I can assure you that they are very creative and very helpful to our sales teams in terms of creating that organic demand. John Mazzoni : Great color. Thank you. And then maybe just to quickly touch on competition. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape? And perhaps has there been any pullback in either smaller regional players or large national players? Jerry Gahlhoff : Competitively, it's -- I mean, it's still a healthy competitive market highly fragmented and lots of players out there. So no -- we haven't seen any significant change from a competitive standpoint. That's probably noteworthy or remarkable still competitive out there. John Mazzoni : Thank you. Perfect. Thanks, again. Congratulations on the strong results. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Davies : Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions for me. You mentioned on the Q2 call that organic growth is running at about 10% in July, which sort of implies that the rest of the quarter is about 7.5% so can you just talk through the sequential movement you sort of witnessed through the months and into quarter end? And then just another one on gross before margin. Are you able to give a split of organic growth between kind of new customers and cross-selling into the existing customer base? Ken Krause : So, on the second point with respect to the margin profile of customers, we unfortunately do not track that and have that -- enjoy that level of detail in the business. But what I can tell you is, cross-sell is certainly always a big part of our strategy. When you look at the strategy, it's important to sell multiple services to one customer for a multitude of reasons. And so, it's certainly continuing to be a focus for us. And we're continuing to see good momentum in that part of our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. When you look sequentially between July, August, September from a growth rate, you're right, July was a pretty big month, where we saw higher levels of organic. But then as we move through the quarter, it remained strong too. It was more in line with our historical averages. It was strong organic growth to close out the quarter as well. Ken Krause : Yes. The only thing that you would add on that is -- and I don't want to start to split hairs, but when you look at Q2, we talked at the end of Q2 about a weak June. And so, it's not out of the question to think or out of the realm of reason to think that some of that business in Q2 may have pulled into Q3 in July and push that number up a bit. And so -- but there's -- I don't -- looking at Jerry, there's nothing other than that that was really out of the ordinary with respect to growth. It was healthy throughout. Ollie Davies : Thanks. Sorry, I mean just can you give a split of organic growth between new customers and cross-selling. Ken Krause : No. We don't -- I mean there's -- we don't -- unfortunately, we don't track that level of detail to a point where I could provide that to you right now. But I can tell you that the growth is healthy. I mean the growth is healthy across both of those areas. It's been healthy for us. Ollie Davies : Okay. Thanks. And then just on adjusted EBITDA last year. I think it was negatively impacted by 140 basis points on the casualty reserve increase. So I guess if you add that back to last year's margin, you sort of get 24.7% versus the 24.8% delivered this quarter. So can you just talk about the moving parts? And is that still a pretty big drag on margin? Ken Krause : Yes. The big point you're missing with that is the fact that the insurance markets have been really challenging. And so, claims are one thing, but insurance is continuing to tie on us. And so when you look at last year, you did have that negative impact on the claims that came through. But unfortunately -- and those have come down this year in Q3, but the insurance costs have not come down. And so, you're seeing really good improvement in the underlying business. It's not 150 basis points and that's why we were transparent in saying that in the quarter, when you set the improvement on the casualty reserve side, you set the Fox improvement aside, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in the underlying margins in the quarter alone. So -- but we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to improve margins as we go forward. Ollie Davies : Okay. Thanks, very much. Ken Krause : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 15, 2024. I'd now like to hand the call over to Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lyndsey Burton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which will be filed later today. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was an outstanding year for Rollins as we achieved a milestone of $3.1 billion in revenue. Demand from our customers remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. While full-year revenue increased 14% versus last year, we grew earnings per share by over 18% and adjusted earnings per share by 20%, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and a commitment to continuous improvement in our business. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter and observed sustained strength in the pest control markets we serve. We also continue to drive share gains in our markets by leveraging a multi-brand, multichannel approach at scale to differentiate ourselves competitively. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods help us reach new customers and enhance engagement with existing customers to support organic growth. We have also strategically allocated resources to the commercial side of our business to capitalize on opportunities within key verticals. Most notably, we have grown our sales force and invested in training and tools to enable their success. Our service quality is high, and our offerings are customized, which helps new sales professionals gain confidence and become successful quickly. Additionally, we are leveraging the scale of our Orkin brand across North America to effectively serve commercial customers coast-to-coast in both the U.S. and Canada. While we're still early with respect to our efforts in this area, we see good results as demonstrated by approximately 11% commercial revenue growth for the year. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. And in 2023, we welcomed 24 new businesses into our company through acquisition. This includes the addition of Fox Pest Control, which was the second largest acquisition in our company's history. Our synergistic approach to integration has gone well with the Fox team exceeding the financial targets we outlined last April. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we divested certain non-core businesses, most notably our lawn care business, which includes insect, fertilization, and weed control for turf grafts. We recognized a pretax gain on sales of that transaction of approximately $15 million. The decision to divest this asset aligns with our strategy to focus on profitable growth in core pest control operations. Operationally, we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams. The hiring environment improved in 2023 as we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions as well as the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing levels help us capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year. 2023 was also an important year with respect to continuous improvement and safety was a key area of focus for us. During the year, we implemented an app that monitors driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. The app protects unsafe driving maneuvers associated with acceleration, breaking and speed, then converts data collected into a driver safety score. I'm pleased to report that by year-end, our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor increased over 30% from the beginning of the year, but we aren't stopping there. Improving the safety culture isn't something that is done overnight. But we are proud of the progress we have made and have set ambitious goals for ourselves to encourage safe behaviors throughout our organization. We believe these efforts will improve our ability to serve customers, help mitigate potentially negative financial impacts on our business and most importantly, ensure our people return home safe every day. Our continuous improvement efforts also set our own initiatives to modernize our back office and support functions. This is a work in progress, but we took some important steps to upgrade talent and systems during the year. These efforts are aimed at further enabling our growth priorities and increasing productivity as we work to become a better, more effective provider of shared services for our brands. In closing, our performance in 2023 demonstrates the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of pest control brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience and investing meaningfully in our team to drive growth both organically, as well as through disciplined acquisitions. We're pleased with where our business stands today and the momentum we carry into 2024. And I want to thank each of our 19,000 plus associates around the world for their efforts and contribution to our success in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Krause : Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect continued strong execution by the team. Let me begin with a few highlights for 2023. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of 14% for the year with double-digit growth across each of our service offerings. It was encouraging to see organic growth of 8% for the year, while acquisitions continue to be a meaningful part of our growth profile, accounting for approximately 6% of our total revenue growth. Second, we made good progress on profitability improvement in 2023. Full-year gross margins were healthy as we were positive on the price cost equation and saw improvement across several key cost categories. Adjusted operating margin finished the year at 19.7%, improving 140 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. This translated into GAAP EPS of $0.89 per share, up over 18% for the year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 20% for the year. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of almost 30% for the year and on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 28% for the year. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $528 million and free cash flow of $495 million, both up over 13% versus last year. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying nearly $1 billion of capital in 2023 with a focus on investing for growth, while returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. Turning to our fourth quarter performance. The team delivered a strong quarter with revenue up 14% to $754 million. Currencies had a negligible impact on quarterly revenue growth. We saw a good balance of growth between organic and inorganic activities as organic revenue was up over 7% with acquisitions accounting for the other 7% of growth. Jerry mentioned that we divested certain non-core businesses in the quarter, most notably our lawn care business. The purchase price for the transaction was $18 million. We received $15 million in proceeds during 2023 and recorded a pretax gain of $15 million on the sale. This business doesn't provide the growth or profitability profile of our core pest control business. Going forward, we don't anticipate any significant divestitures associated with portfolio rationalization in the foreseeable future. In the fourth quarter, Residential revenues increased approximately 18%, Commercial Pest Controls rose nearly 11%, and Termite and Ancillary was up over 13%. Organic growth was healthy across the portfolio with growth of nearly 5% in Residential, approximately 9% in Commercial, and over 11% in Termite and Ancillary. We normally see a step down in revenue as well as growth in Q4 along with Q1 due to seasonality. Comparing Q4 this year to last year, we saw an acceleration in organic growth across all service lines. Gross margin improved 40 basis points to 50.9% in the quarter. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 30 basis points, we saw 10 basis points of improvement in organic margins as leverage from people costs and fleet offset pressure from materials and supplies and higher insurance-related costs. Gross profit also steps down in Q4 and Q1, primarily due to lower volume levels associated with the seasonality of our business I previously discussed. With that said, I'm pleased with the fourth quarter performance as we saw improvement year-over-year and recorded our highest Q4 gross margin level in the last several decades. Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points in the quarter. We saw nice leverage on people costs, which offset increased advertising and selling expense associated with the growth initiatives that Jerry discussed previously. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $139 million, up 16% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million, up over 20% versus the prior year on 14% total revenue growth. Quarterly EBITDA was $181 million, up 24% versus last year, and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24%, up 190 basis points versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million, up 14% and representing a 22.1% margin, flat versus last year. While we saw nice leverage with respect to both gross profit and SG&A, adjusted EBITDA margins were negatively impacted by about 40 basis points in the quarter due to lower non-operational gains on property and vehicle sales that were included in other income when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This impacted incremental EBITDA margins in the quarter as well. The effective tax rate was 25.8% for both the quarter and the full-year period. And for 2024, we're expecting an effective rate -- tax rate of approximately 26%. Quarterly GAAP net income was approximately $109 million or $0.22 per share, an increase of nearly 30% from $0.17 per share in the same period a year ago. For the fourth quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items that I mentioned earlier, totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. We also recognized the $15 million pretax benefit associated with a gain on the sale of our non-core business. Taking into account these adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $101 million or $0.21 per share, increasing over 23% from the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 24% in the quarter to $153 million. We generated $142 million of free cash flow on $109 million of GAAP earnings, a 22% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 100% for the quarter. Debt remains low and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross and net level. We continued to fund our dividend in the quarter. Going back to the fourth quarter of 2022, we have increased our dividend 45% and we remain committed to funding our growing dividend as cash flow improves. As we look to 2024, we remain encouraged by the strength of our markets and the execution by our team. We are focused on delivering another year of robust growth and healthy incremental margins, further complemented by a strategic and disciplined approach to M&A. From a pricing perspective, we remain focused on effectively pricing the value of our services to remain positive on the price cost equation. And we have begun to raise prices for 2024 in the first quarter at a rate that is consistent with 2023 levels. We also continue to be active in managing our rate cards. Our focus remains on driving consistent growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and compounding cash flow that will enable a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on investing in growth initiatives in our core market. Before I turn the call back to Jerry, I wanted to announce that we will be holding an investor and analyst conference on the morning of May 17th in New York City, where we will share more about our strategic priorities and how we are positioning ourselves for continued success in the future. We're looking forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks and months. But for now, please hold the date. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim Mulrooney : Jerry, Ken, good morning. Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning. Kenneth Krause : Good morning. Tim Mulrooney : A couple of questions here. On the resi organic growth, Ken, as you highlight, it decelerated from 7% to 5% from the third to the fourth quarter. But you're right. As I look at results historically, I do see a slight deceleration seasonally from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, typically. So could you just talk about what those seasonal factors are? Like onetime revenue or whatever else. And if that's the case, could you also talk about how your recurring -- your residential recurring revenue stream looked like in the fourth quarter? Kenneth Krause : Certainly, Tim, I'll start, and then turn it over to Jerry for additional comments as well. But when we look at the business, the business, as you so well indicate has a high degree of recurring revenue. And so as a result, there is a consistent base to the revenue that we enjoy and we benefit from. The one thing that does have an impact on our business from time-to-time is what we call onetime type of service. And when we look at the quarter in the fourth quarter, we did see a decel and the deceleration in the rate of growth in those areas of our business. That's probably the largest area of impact on the revenue growth in the quarter. We were really encouraged, quite frankly with the level of growth that we continue to see from the recurring business. It was a healthy level of growth for us, despite being stacked up against last October, you may recall was more beneficial because hurricane season was pretty tough in September. And so some of that business pushed into the fourth quarter of last year. There's always puts and takes, of course, in this business with weather. But we continue to be pretty encouraged with respect to our growth, especially in the resi sector. Jerry Gahlhoff : And I would add, Ken, as I think about residential pest control, your -- every other month in your quarterly service frequency offerings of your recurring base, that's your bread and butter. That is the healthiest indicator of what's going on in our business as we are growing our business, increasing our volumes and are we ending the year from a positive standpoint and customer -- in net customers -- net new customers to start the year, we certainly did that. And that quarterly and EOM pest control is your bread and butter and the onetime is that gravy on top. And sometimes you don't always get that gravy and that's what's really caused the slowdown in addition to the divestiture of the lawn care, that was about another $1 million on the residential side that also impacted that number in the quarter as well, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Okay. So there was a little less gravy in the fourth quarter, which implies that your recurring revenue in that business is above your stated organic growth in the fourth quarter. Am I correct on that? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. Absolutely. Our recurring quarterly every other month service definitely outpaced our organic overall number. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. The other one for me, and thank you for that, is on digital [indiscernible]. You mentioned last quarter that digital marketing [indiscernible] were, I think the language was flat to down slightly. Correct me if I'm wrong about that. But I was just curious if that trend carried through the fourth quarter or if it moves up or down at all? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So as we look at the digital queries we saw in the fourth quarter, the digital queries, we saw modest increases in the quarter versus the prior year. But we did -- so it did result in some healthy increases in lead starts and sales both from a digital as well as just overall in our business. We did see a lift there. It was certainly better than flat. It wasn't stellar performance, but it was an improvement year-over-year. So we believe we continue to benefit from a diversified approach that we're not overly reliant on all the digital space. And that's a key part of the formula in our organic growth. Kenneth Krause : Yes. It's interesting, Jerry, just adding on to that. When we look at the business in the fourth quarter and as well as throughout the year, what really proves the point that we're continuing to see good cross-sell, and we always talk about additional ways we access the customer. And one area is the cross-sell and the Termite and Ancillary business is really representative of that. We continue to see really robust levels of demand on the Ancillary side of our business, which is driven a lot by that cross-sell activity that the team continued to execute upon. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you, Jerry and Ken. When my kids turn 16, I might try to hit you off from one of those driver monitoring systems. Jerry Gahlhoff : It's a good idea. You should probably get on it yourself, too. Tim Mulrooney : Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Haas with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Jason Haas : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could remind us what level of price increase you had put in last year. And I know it's early in the year, but I'm curious if you're seeing any more sensitivity from customers to the price increase you're putting in this year versus last? Kenneth Krause : So as we had talked about previously, Jason, we had passed along a 3% to 4% price increase in the prior year. We followed that on again this year with a similar price increase here in the first quarter, ahead of our heavier pest market season, which starts here later in the first quarter. So we're pretty -- in terms of what we're seeing on the customer side, we monitor that. We assess that, we look at churn, we look at cancellations, we look at rollbacks. We look at a number of different metrics. And we feel like the level that we're passing along is at a very healthy level and is representative of the value of our services. Jason Haas : Got it. That's great to hear. And then as a follow-up question, I'm curious if you could just talk about competitive dynamics in the industry. I'm curious how your growth rates in 4Q compared to the industry? If you feel like you're still gaining share? And just if you see any opportunities for the share gains in the year ahead? Jerry Gahlhoff : I mean we continue to have a highly fragmented market in this industry. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't necessarily characterize any significant shifts or changes in that competitiveness, it's always been that way. And while there are some ebbs and flows in here and there, we just keep doing what we do, focusing on our business and trying to win at what we do so. Kenneth Krause : When we look at our growth, Jason, in the quarter at organic growth, which was north of 7%, and we think about how that fares relative to how we've discussed the business and also how we outperformed. We're pretty happy with the level of growth that we're seeing come through the business. And we also continue to have a high degree of optimism and we're encouraged about the future growth that we continue to see in this business. So we really look at how we're performing relative to our expectations, and we continue to perform at a level that we're pretty pleased with. Jason Haas : Got it. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Following up on the Residential business. Can you talk about what recurring revenue growth trends were? How did it perform relative to your earlier quarters? And what you see as the key drivers of growth acceleration going forward? Kenneth Krause : Certainly, George. When we look at the growth rates and we look at their recurring revenue growth relative to prior quarters, the business continues to perform pretty well. It continues to hold in there. I mean Q4 always sees a step down and just generally the growth year-over-year. But it's above what we saw a year ago, and it continues to be at a healthy level. So there's nothing that's indicating that there's a significant decel in the growth rates or a different or a change in profile and the growth rates that we're seeing coming through our business. George Tong : Got it. And you talked about earlier, making good progress with bundling, cross-selling in door-to-door sales. Can you talk a little bit about your priorities for 2024 with respect to these areas and how you expect that to drive volume performance? Kenneth Krause : Certainly, when you step back and you look at the business, George, we look at it across a number of different priorities. We -- and when we think about our expectations going forward, we talked earlier about our pricing. We're focused certainly on getting the value of our services through strategic pricing management. And we again raised prices and we'll continue to raise prices and manage our rate cards effectively. So that's one side of the equation. And so that rate -- that growth rate associated with pricing is at this point expected to be in line with what we saw a year ago at 3% to 4%. And then secondly, when we look at growth profile across the business, we remain encouraged by our position in our market. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver a healthy level of growth going forward that's in line with what we've seen here in the last couple of years. We've all enjoyed the benefit and you've seen the benefit of our growth rate accelerating post-COVID. We continue to operate at a pretty healthy level of growth in our business from an organic perspective. And then, of course, we saw a really robust uptick in growth associated with M&A in the last year. When we look at the initiatives across the business, the cross-sell is certainly really important, going after those customers that may have one service, but trying to add additional services like mosquito and ticks and other services like that. Continuing the focusing on the Termite and Ancillary business is very important. And then last but certainly not least, is the Commercial side. Jerry spoke about the Commercial business in detail, we talked about it in the third quarter as well. We continue to place this portion of focus on the Commercial business and driving growth there. So all of those initiatives are coming together to give us optimism as we think about our growth rates going forward. Jerry Gahlhoff : George, I'll add. This is Jerry. When we think about one of the ways I just love our business model is the diversity that we get from our brand strategy. Each of our brands has various different ways to acquire customers, whether it be, say, Northwest and Home team that rely heavily on the homebuilding market or Fox doing door-to-door. And now, for example, we have Home team doing door-to-door and expanding that offering in their business by things they learn from the Fox team. These are all things that we can deploy across and due to the diversity of our brands and what each one brings to the table that we think continues to help us with this solid growth profile for the future. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael Hoffman : So the challenge is to how creative can I be to ask four questions in two. Good morning, everybody. Kenneth Krause : Good morning. Michael Hoffman : So things that would help the model, Ken, are specifics that I think you can share like the three to four and 1Q pricing. What is the dollar amount of the M&A rollover from '23, so everybody just gets that right? And how do you think about the cadence of it in the calendar year, so we just don't get that wrong? Kenneth Krause : Certainly. When we look at M&A, we continue to be focused on M&A. We continue to focus on executing that disciplined strategy. We see roughly 2% carryover coming into 2024 from M&A. A large part of that, of course is here in the first quarter with Fox, we acquired Fox last April. So we still have one quarter of benefit. When we look at the pipeline, we see a healthy pipeline. We were very active to close out the year and then also to start 2024. January activity in deals that we closed are up. So we continue to chart towards that 2% plus level of growth, 2% to 3% plus level of growth associated with M&A as we go forward. But the carryover is around 2%. Michael Hoffman : Okay. And then it's shared with us that incremental margins on an adjusted basis for 2029, both on an adjusted and adjusted 28%, 29%. What is the target for this year? And how does non-operating gains influence that? And maybe can you isolate what those gains were in '22 and '23, so we can understand how to think about them in '24. There's my creative question with four [indiscernible]? Kenneth Krause : Certainly. When we look at the incremental margin profile, there's no reason -- I mean, we continue to see and have a confidence level in delivering 30% incremental margins. If you look at the incremental margin in the last several years, we've seen it step up. Our focus has been -- we've been laser-focused on incremental margins and driving improvements on the margin profile. And so when we think about that level, that's the range at 30%. We've seen quarters as high as 35% to 40%. So it will jump around from quarter-to-quarter. And you're going to see that. But generally, when we step back and we finished the year at 28% to 30%, we're pretty pleased. That means we're getting 70 basis points as we did of improvement in EBITDA margins. The gains on asset sales will come through. They came through in Q3 -- or I'm sorry, Q4 here. And we saw roughly $3 million lower asset sales that came through other income, about 40 basis points on the margin line and the EBITDA margin line. And that will come through from time-to-time. And we'll try to isolate that as we go forward for you. Michael Hoffman : Okay. Thanks. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I can ask a clarifying question on resi. Obviously, good to hear the recurring revenues within resi continue to do really well and the digital inquiries are also pretty stable. Just a question there is, have you seen any change, particularly from competitor pushing harder on the marketing spend, is that changing anything? Did that change anything in the fourth quarter? But maybe importantly, going into 2024, how should we think about the demand environment? You talked about a pretty solid demand environment. I was wondering if you could provide any color on cicadas and the two groups of cicadas coming or emerging in '24, what do would that mean for the demand environment? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : Ashish, I'll -- this is Jerry. I'll kind of try to take the first part of that statement. I asked our marketing team what was going on in the fourth quarter from a digital spend standpoint. It was a time when we'd like to invest a little earlier in the year in some of the marketing. And it did appear anecdotally that there was a pretty significant uptick in competitive spend in the fourth quarter at a time when we were backing, winding down some of our marketing spend that there was some pretty significant investment in the market there in the fourth quarter. So we certainly saw the competitive environment pick up in that regard where there was more spend into there. Now how that equated to sales and starts to new customers or onetime work on the residential side, we don't really know. But -- so that's on your first question, that's... Kenneth Krause : Yes. And the second part of your question, I think, it was around cicadas and new pests. And we continue to monitor new pest activity. Cicadas are one of the many pests that we continue to monitor. Jerry, I don't know if you want to add. I'm certainly not the expert when it comes to cicadas. You're probably much better positioned to answer that? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. Well, cicadas typically are not a household pest control problem. They are a nuisance because when they come out and the volumes as they did a couple of years ago, they wreak havoc from a noise standpoint, I know -- I have a house in the mountains that you couldn't sleep at night, and it was very annoying. But they tend to just go away over time, but it probably will create some awareness about pests in general and things that bother humans, but it's not as though our pest control companies are going to be out there attempting to eradicate cicadas. So that's seemingly an impossible feat. We're really just out there waiting for them to die off and go away and start the whole process over again. So it will probably create some buzz in the marketplace, and that's always good for business. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe if I can ask a question on the back-office modernization. Ken, if you can just help us understand where you are on that process? And how should we think about that contribution to incremental EBITDA margins in '24, but also midterm? Thanks. Kenneth Krause : Yes. We continue to be very early on in our journey with respect to modernization, making good progress. We've added a number of new team members across our back office, we've made some significant changes. But we're pretty excited about what's to come. With that said, when we look at the SG&A performance over time, we've continued to see that improve. Going back a couple of years, it was almost 31%. It's come down under 29% here in the quarter. So we continue to leverage that and despite having investments and growth initiatives associated with the commercial business as well as other parts of our business. And so we're early on in the journey. We feel like there's some opportunities as we go forward to continue to improve the business. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. Very helpful and really strong momentum in commercial and ancillary services. So congrats on that. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe bridging from the prior question on SG&A. I guess, you've done a really good job improving gross margin over the last several years. I guess from an SG&A perspective, is there an expectation that the leverage there can increase a little bit over time as some of your initiatives get more traction? Kenneth Krause : Yes. I think there's an opportunity to improve upon the SG&A performance. And we've said that for some time, and we continue to see improvement in SG&A. With that said, we do have a disproportionate investment in securing customers through advertising and door-to-door and other activities. But with that said, our focus is to continue to improve upon the administrative side of the back office and without sacrificing the investments for growth. And so we're hopeful to see improvement as we go forward, just like we've seen in the last couple of years here. In the last year or so, we continue to see improvement despite the investments we're making. But we feel like we're well positioned on that front. Josh Chan : Okay. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. And on the Residential side, you mentioned that the onetime service slowed down a little in Q4 and maybe a little slower in Q1 as well. Is there anything to interpret from that from perhaps a macro perspective or any other reasons that would drive that to be a little slower for the upcoming quarter as well? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. Really, what we saw was a slowdown in some of the residential bed bug, onetime work and also on the wildlife side, which often involves some rat type of -- rat and rodent type of work, a slowdown there. Those are the main drivers of that, whether that's seasonal, whether it's something that's changed in the weather or change in demand. We're not completely certain of any of that. But bed bugs, for example, being down has always been something that has fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year on some of the ups and downs. And it was just more significantly down for us in recent months. Kenneth Krause : When we look at that question, Josh, because we've looked at that as well because we deal with consumers, homeowners. And when we look at the business and we assess more of a macro level, we look across our business. We look not only in the Residential pest control that Jerry just spoke about, well we also look at the Termite Ancillary. And that Ancillary business is normally some high-ticket items. And if that continues to grow, the pace it's growing, it's indicative that the consumer is pretty healthy. With that said, we were proactive in the end of last year at tightening credit down in a number of different areas just to ensure that we don't run into any issues from a credit perspective. And so in our acceptance score, we raised the minimum level per credit, just trying to be proactive in today's market. But from a demand perspective, we're certainly not seeing any major deterioration in growth profile with our customers. Josh Chan : Great. Thank you both for the real good color. And good luck in 2024. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I was hoping you could give us an update on labor, namely your salespeople. Are you seeing higher employee retention right now versus normal? And I know you mentioned deploying some sales tools and wondering if you could talk about other initiatives as well. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So the labor side of it is we have been very good at hiring onboard and training our sales teams, especially on the -- well, really on the Commercial and Residential side, we're talking specifically a little bit more about the Commercial side. But one of the things that you learn with on the Commercial side, where you typically have a longer sales cycle, it takes longer from the time so you have a lead or create a creative lead to get a deal closed, you really have to get those salespeople productive in selling and finding success early on. And that's what helps you with keeping people in the long term. The more they're successful, the more they're winning. The longer they stay and the more money they earn, they go to our presidents club events, those types of things. And I'm really proud of our -- of the sales team that we've built both on the Commercial and Residential side. It's a team of very high-performing people that we've enabled that through how we hire, how we train, how we invest in them, how we give them those tools to be successful. And that's ultimately what drives retention. That's what makes them want to stay. So we have a lot of momentum in that space that I just feel really good about as we head into 2024. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. I wanted to ask a big picture around footprint. Are you happy with the current coverage and portfolio of geographies that you're in? Or are there other geographies that you'd like to gain further density in? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would say we are pretty happy. We have very broad geographic coverage under the Orkin brand in North America. And when you look in the U.S., mainly the area that we don't have the second bite of the apple brand strategy is fully built is really probably in the Midwest where we have some opportunity where we would like to continue to add and invest in M&A. And then when you think about international, we're very happy with our Australian operations growing and healthy, and we're going to continue to build out Australia, the United Kingdom and Singapore where we currently operate, but we really haven't put a lot of upper energy behind expanding outside of those areas. We like where we are, and we're going to continue to build and focus on those countries where we've expanded internationally. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Kenneth Krause : Good morning. Stephanie Moore : I was hoping you could touch a little bit on maybe what you're seeing on the unit cost inflation side, some key areas. You give a little bit about labor, but maybe just across the board, labor, materials, equipment, the likes and kind of expectations for 2024 versus what you saw, experienced in 2023? Thanks. Kenneth Krause : When we look across the cost structure, we look at our people costs, we look at our material supplies, we look at our fleet. Those are the 3 major drivers of cost in addition to insurance and claims, which sometimes can be less controllable, not completely controllable as much as some of the other areas. But we're pretty pleased with the leverage we saw on the organic side of our business across those 3 cost categories. We continue to benefit from lower gas prices, slightly lower gas prices, lower oil prices. That's definitely beneficial on the fleet side of our business. The interest rate environment certainly is less favorable from a leasing perspective. But we continue to focus on pricing the value of our services so that our gross margins will continue to improve and step higher. We were pleased with the 50 basis points we saw this past year on the gross margin side of our -- organic side of gross margin, and we're continuing to focus on leveraging our cost structure in a similar fashion going forward. Jerry Gahlhoff : And Stephanie, I would add, we do have some concerns about truck prices rising. Some of these fleet vehicles or costs are going up. As Ken mentioned, there's always the wild card as fuel prices and fluctuations we have there. On the M&S side, we just completed an RFP on our insecticides and termiticides, trying to ensure our pricing is in line on that and trying to generate some savings or at least offset the -- as much as we can, some of the price increases that are being passed along to us from some of our suppliers. So those are all things that are top of mind for us that we'll keep focused on through the year. Stephanie Moore : Great. No, that's helpful. And then, I mean, I guess just as a follow-up, I'm just trying to piece together the idea of similar price increases in 2024 versus 2023 but it sounds like the -- inflation is supposedly coming down here in 2024. So I guess what you're saying is it's probably still a little too early to tell if the inflationary side will have that material -- will step down in 2024. Is that kind of the right way to interpret that? Jerry Gahlhoff : That's -- yes, that's what I'm hitting at. There's still -- there's some unknowns, there may be still some costs that we don't know. And you look at the inflation data that demonstrate that it's not necessarily slowing as fast as we all would probably like it to. So we're still -- we're cautiously optimistic there. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then just lastly, on M&A and kind of M&A activity, any changes in terms of pipeline or willingness of sellers that you've seen as of late? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : I don't think there's any significant change. There's still good deal flow out there. We -- there's good businesses that are out there for sale. And while -- from a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's some ebbs and flows to that kind of volume that we get to see or look at. But there's still plenty of good business out there that are potentially worth acquiring. So we've gotten off to a good start already in January. We feel good about our pipeline. We're actually a little ahead of where we were last year in that regard. But last year, keep in mind, in January, February, we announced the Fox deal in April, we were heads down working on the Fox deal. So we put a lot of stuff aside to focus on that. So now we're back to kind of business as usual and looking at normal deal flow. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you guys so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. John Mazzoni : Quickly, yes. So maybe quickly, just to touch on the price/cost spread. Looking at the kind of improvements in the driver safety score and that KPI, could you just help us understand how that can flow through to kind of lower insurance-related costs going forward? And what's the typical timing or delay? I mean, this is probably not going to be a kind of near-term item, but could we expect in the back half of the year? Or would it be something that has a longer variable lag? Thanks. Kenneth Krause : It's a hard thing to predict, John, when you look at that trend line because it does take quite a while to work its way through. The last 12 months or so year-over-year, insurance and claims costs were negative for us despite not having large payouts, large claims that we settled like we did a year or so ago. But with that said, we're hopeful that it will improve. When we look at safety, it's not just about the financials either, it's about our people. And so when we think about our people-first culture, we want people to be safe. We want them to return home each and every night and that's really the focus here. It's how we make sure our drivers are safe and the communities that they continue to work and remain very safe, and they can get home each and every day. So we're focused on the people side. By doing the right thing, ultimately, the financials will improve. And that's the focus here. As we think about the future in the next several years, that we'll continue to see improvements on safety. People will be safe and we'll see the benefits of that come through our financial statement. John Mazzoni : Great color. And then maybe just the last one is around kind of a preview of the Investor Day. Anything that we could kind of look forward to, maybe around technology or capital allocation? Or should we just stay tuned? Thanks. Kenneth Krause : Yes. I would say, stay tuned, but we're really excited to get back to New York and to spend time with our investment community, talking about our growth prospects, our strategic priorities for the future, talking about how we will continue to expect the investments and growth initiatives. We're just really excited to spend the day talking about the future of this great company. John Mazzoni : Sounds great. Looking forward to it. Kenneth Krause : Thank you, John. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now hand the call back to management for any closing comments. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in a few months. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I will now turn the conference over to Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Lyndsey Burton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Before I turn it over to Jerry, I want to remind everyone of our upcoming Investor Day on May 17 in New York City. We're looking forward to hosting the investment community and discussing our strategies for growing our business and driving value for our stakeholders. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the first quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of nearly 14% to $748 million. We delivered healthy organic growth of 7.5% in the quarter despite some unfavorable and erratic weather in January compared to last year, which Ken will discuss in more detail. Overall, we continued to see double-digit revenue growth across all major service lines as total Residential revenue increased 16.5%, Commercial rose 11.4% and Termite was up 11.7% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business.  As you would expect, we invested in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities ahead of peak season to ensure that we are well positioned and top of mind for the consumer as pet season begins. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front, so that people are onboarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. On the commercial side of the business, we are leveraging analytics to identify areas in the market where opportunity warrants additional resources. And this continues to pay dividends as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit commercial growth. We continue to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and are leveraging our training and sales tools to better enable their success as well. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of closing the Fox acquisition, and that team has performed exceptionally well. We anticipate that Fox will continue to positively impact organic growth and profitability as we go forward. We closed 12 tuck-in deals in the first 3 months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw a healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Safety remains an important area of focus for us and efforts to enhance safety coaching, training and protocols resulted in higher driving safety scores and fewer recorded safety incidents when compared to a year ago. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. This year is off to a solid start, and demand from our customers remains strong with over 7% organic growth in the first quarter.  Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy, and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 19,000-plus team members around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. Before I hand it over to Ken, I'd like to announce a few changes to our Board of Directors. First, we would like to thank Jerry Nix, who recently retired from our Board, for his service to our company. We've been so fortunate to have Jerry as our Lead Director for the past several years. His experience, wisdom and guidance helped us navigate uncharted waters for our company, and we're incredibly grateful for the significant contributions he's made along the way. Second, we would like to welcome Dale Jones, who was elected to our Board at a recent shareholder meeting. Additionally, Louise Sams has been appointed as our new Lead Independent Director. We're excited about the level of expertise and experience that both Dale and Louise will bring to our Board in their new roles. Ken, I'll now turn the call over to you. Kenneth Krause : Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start. Growth was robust at the start of the year. We delivered revenue growth of 13.7% year-over-year. Organic growth was 7.5%, and we saw significant improvement moving throughout the quarter as organic revenue growth accelerated to over 10% for February and March. Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up a healthy 130 basis points with strong gross profit performance and solid expense leverage despite incremental investments aimed at growing our business. Cash flow continues to be very strong with free cash flow increasing 29%, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. Diving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. In the first quarter, residential revenues increased 16.5%, commercial pest control rose 11.4% and termite and ancillary increased by 11.7%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 4.3% in residential, 10.1% in commercial and 9.3% in termite and ancillary. As Jerry mentioned, our residential organic growth was impacted by a slower start in January. To provide context, February and March total organic growth was a very strong 10.8% versus 7.5% for the quarter. And looking at residential revenue specifically, February and March organic growth was a healthy 8% versus 4.3% for the quarter. We are pleased with the consistent growth we continue to see across the business. Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were healthy at 51.2%, up 90 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 40 basis points, organic margin improved 50 basis points as we saw nice leverage from people cost, fleet and materials and supplies. Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. We saw healthy leverage from administrative-related costs which enabled reinvestment and incremental advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives that Jerry discussed. First quarter GAAP operating income was $132 million, up 18% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $138 million, up nearly 23% versus prior year on approximately 14% total revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up 130 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins, coupled with solid expense leverage. First quarter EBITDA was $160 million, up over 14% and representing a 21.3% margin, up 10 basis points versus last year. You'll recall that last quarter, we called out a negative impact to adjusted EBITDA due to lower nonoperational gains versus the comparable period in the prior year. We saw a similar dynamic in the first quarter as well. Given that we do from time to time, divest nonoperational assets, we have made the decision to exclude gains and losses on these types of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are measures of operating performance, and this change will allow us to better compare our underlying performance more consistently over time. A table showing the revised metrics for fiscal 2023 is included in our earnings release. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, up 19% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.5% was strong, improving 100 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Incremental adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%, a healthy result considering that Q1 is a slower period and can have a lower profitability profile as we invest ahead of our busier seasons. The effective tax rate was approximately 24% in the quarter, in line with the prior year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $94 million or $0.19 per share, increasing from $0.18 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $98 million or $0.20 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest cost on the higher debt balances versus the comparable period.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 27% in the quarter to $127 million. We generated $120 million of free cash flow, a 29% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 120% for the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling $47 million, and we paid $73 million in dividends, both up versus the same period a year ago. Debt-to-EBITDA leverage is well below 1x on a gross and net level, and our balance sheet is very healthy and positions us well to continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our teams. Demand is healthy and our acquisition pipeline provides us a sense of optimism. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Timothy Mulrooney with William Blair. Timothy Mulrooney : So just stepping back here, with trends accelerating in February and March. I just wonder if folks are going to extrapolate that 10% organic growth rate into the next several months and quarters. I mean 10% to me just sounds like touch on the strong side. So I wonder if that's how you're thinking about things or if expectations are better level set to kind of what we saw over the last several quarters, more in that 7% to 8% range for organic growth. Kenneth Krause : Thanks for the question, Tim. I appreciate that. And when looking at the business, we certainly did see some improvements as we went throughout the quarter. But one quarter is certainly not a long-term trend. We are continuing to remain very confident in our outlook, and that outlook is really anchored around 7% to 8% sort of growth rate that we've consistently talked about. That stepped up, as you all know, since COVID, and we continue to benefit from that higher growth rate and more favorable operating environment. But yes, I think 7% to 8% is kind of how we think about the business from an organic basis going forward. Timothy Mulrooney : That's really helpful. Thank you, Ken. And this is not a follow-up. It's a completely separate topic, but I'm going to do it anyway. The step-up in sales and marketing expense, okay? I think there's a couple of different ways folks could interpret that, either as more of a defensive move, because you're having to spend more, maybe on digital marketing to win customers or more as an offensive move, hiring more sales folks for future growth, for example. Could you just double click into that increase in sales and marketing expense column? And help us understand that decision a little better to ramp up spend there? Jerry Gahlhoff : Tim, this is Jerry. A lot of that cost really lied on the heavier side on the selling expense as it relates to us staffing up. Let me give you a couple of examples, a couple of data points. Just looking at Orkin alone, when we looked compared to prior year in the first quarter, we had over 50 more commercial account managers at Orkin alone. We had over 100 more home sales inspectors at Orkin in the first quarter of this year than we did the last year. So that's where a lot of our investment continues to be. We see that opportunity. That's what I referred to as the feet on the street opportunity. So our sales salaries are up there. It's not necessarily some sort of targeted defensive marketing spend. It's an offensive sales mobilization and really building out your sales team for the growth opportunities ahead. Operator : Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Keen Fai Tong : I wanted to dive into trends that you're seeing in the residential business. It sounds like most of the impact to organic revenue growth in residential was due to unfavorable January weather, leading to the 4% organic growth. I wanted to see if there were any other trends you would call out there? I know last quarter, you highlighted onetime sales impact. So any changes there and other operating items to consider as it relates to the organic growth in residential? Kenneth Krause : Certainly. When we look at the residential business, we look at the residential business very broadly across our residential services as well as our termite and ancillary. Across that portfolio, the business continues to perform very well. Onetime business can be choppy. It continues to be choppy. But generally, demand for our services remains very healthy. As I indicated in my prepared commentary, what we saw when we look just at the residential business alone, we saw an improvement, 4.3% growth for the quarter but close to 8% growth as we look at February and March. So we continue to see really good demand levels for our business. Jerry Gahlhoff : I would add to that, George, that when we think about some of the onetime business as well, as Ken mentioned, it's usually choppier in the shoulder seasons when weather -- that's an area of the business that weather can impact more so than anything, but you still have your recurring customer base that's there to service. But we also continue to see really strong health in our onetime ancillary business that really shows that a consumer side of it is strong and the consumers continue to be willing to invest in protecting their homes. Keen Fai Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then within the termite and ancillary services business, organic growth seems to have decelerated a bit to 9% compared to 11% in 4Q. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes that could have led to that performance? Kenneth Krause : Certainly, when you unpack the termite business, there's 2 components to the termite and ancillary. There is your normal recurring termite business, your pretreat business, and then you have ancillary business in there as well. We're seeing really good demand across the spectrum. Our business, our recurring bait monitoring business, continues to grow at a very healthy level, but also our ancillary business in that area continues to grow as well at a nice rate. So it's really a broad-based growth that we're seeing in demand for our services. Keen Fai Tong : Okay. Got it. Any factors that could have caused the deceleration in organic revenue growth there? Jerry Gahlhoff : I look at it from a productivity standpoint. We continue to -- the sales are there, the working the backlog can be a challenge. And in the quarter -- and that goes back to a January type of phenomenon, where we had more branches and operations closed for multiple days compared to the prior year. And that affects productivity and ability to get the work done, even if our sales force is out there selling and they're out there continuing to do what they do and building that backlog of work to get done. And so the work is there for us to get done. So we're optimistic about that. It's not a selling issue. It's us getting all the workload done in a given period of time. So when you carry a backlog over into the second quarter, things still look healthy. That helps, to add any color. Operator : Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Unknown Analyst : On for Stephanie Moore. I just wanted to touch on commercial organic growth that's been pretty strong over the last few quarters. And I know you mentioned leveraging analytics and things like that, but I was just curious if there's anything else to call out? And if you could kind of talk about the sustainability of growth there? Jerry Gahlhoff : I know it sounds like a broken record and we've said this now for a few years. We just continue to invest in our sales staff, getting them ramped up and being successful. That B2B sales process is a relationship type of sale. It's got a long selling cycle, and you got to be patient, you got to invest. You got to invest in training and sales tools and supporting those new account managers when they're brought up to get them ramped up and brought to speed just as fast as possible. That is the more you add in the sales force and the more investments you make to make them successful. We just continue to see that opportunity there. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than being committed to continue to add incrementally to our sales force. Kenneth Krause : It's interesting. When I step back and I look at the financials, and I look at the trend in spend across different categories of SG&A, Jerry is spot on, sales salaries continues to be an area that we continue to invest disproportionately in. We're saving money in some of the back office costs and admin areas, but we continue to invest pretty heavily on the front end of our business and taking a very offensive perspective on our business. Unknown Analyst : Just on the resi side, have you guys seen any slowdown? Anything that's meaningful related to the new business wins or a sort of meaningful pickup in customer churn and maybe lower household income areas? And then just anything you could share around how April is kind of shaping up so far? Jerry Gahlhoff : We haven't seen any significant change from a retention issue one way or the other. So that remains pretty solid and any color on April... Kenneth Krause : It would be very difficult to grow our business at the rate we're growing if we saw [ chiding ] in customer churn. And so customer churn, although it is not [ chiding ], it still remains an opportunity for us to continue to improve. When we look at April, we continue to see healthy levels of demand. We're starting April strongly. But again, we continue to think about a 7% to 8% sort of organic growth rate across the business as we think about the future. Operator : Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Unknown Analyst : This is [ David Pedron ] for Ashish. In terms of capital allocation, now that you've lapped the Fox acquisition, how should we think about I guess, your M&A pipeline in terms of larger deals or smaller deals going forward, especially given this robust free cash flow that you keep generating? Kenneth Krause : When we look at the pipeline, it's very healthy. It's very balanced. There's opportunities across the spectrum with respect to M&A. Something that we have consistently said, however, for 2024, is that we do think that 2% to 3% of revenue growth is probably a realistic expectation of contribution from M&A. We continue to look at deals. We continue to evaluate deals. And in fact, in Q1, we spent roughly $45 million to $50 million on M&A, and that was up considerably year-over-year. Of course, last year, we were preparing for Fox. But I think it just shows that there continues to be a very healthy pipeline of M&A in a very fragmented market that we continue to compete in. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Josh Chan with UBS. Joshua Chan : So I guess you mentioned that 7% to 8% is sustainable growth rate. And given how strong commercial and termite is, does that imply that you expect residential to kind of remain in this 4% range going forward? Just curious how you're thinking about how the different businesses contribute to that 7% to 8%. Kenneth Krause : It's interesting when you start to put a fine point on that, but we do think that probably commercial and termite and ancillary will probably grow a little bit faster than the overall average and resi might grow a little bit slower. You just have puts and takes across the portfolio. It doesn't mean that we're not bullish in residential, but I just think that, that's generally how the growth profile has unfolded over time for us. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, I agree with you, Ken. I think it's hard to predict that. I mean, there's going to be movement in any of those categories potentially based on a number of factors and where it all comes out in that 7% to 8% total. Joshua Chan : Yes. Okay. That helps [indiscernible] color there. And then on your decision to accelerate investment during the off season. Sometimes you focus on the peak season to invest, sometimes you invest ahead of the season. So could you just talk about the rationale for investing ahead of the season this year, what you're seeing and what opportunities you expect to realize? Kenneth Krause : Yes. As we had talked about, I mean, the business started to grow pretty nicely on a year-over-year basis, organic basis in February and into the March. And so we saw that, and we saw an opportunity to pull forward some investments. It doesn't mean that we're going to invest any lighter in Q2. In fact, we're going to continue to invest in Q2 and drive further growth. The market opportunity is there and you've got to invest when that market opportunity is there. This is a very short cycle business. And when you see weather patterns that improve or demand trends that might change, you have to be ready to invest. And so I think that's just -- it's just reflective of our investment and our interest in investing in growth across our portfolio. Jerry Gahlhoff : We had a lot more carrying costs from people side in late fourth quarter and certainly in the first quarter than I think we've ever had. The reality is it's certainly harder to find people and then with the level of intensity that we put and the time and energy that we put into training and development upfront, that takes time to have people ready. And so our strategy has been to get ahead of that. Operator : Our next question is from Ollie Davies with Redburn Atlantic. Oliver Davies : Just 2 for me. So firstly, can you just talk about the level of price increases you're putting through? And if you're seeing any pushback on the residential side, just given the level of volume growth in the first quarter. And then secondly, in terms of -- probably one for Ken just in terms of the SG&A. I mean, obviously, the admin expenses, I guess some of that is coming from the modernization that you did last year. So how sustainable are they going forward through this year, and I guess, your ability to reinvest that? Kenneth Krause : So looking at your questions, thank you for your questions. The first question with respect to pricing, it's interesting. When we step back and we look at this business, I think recently, you've heard me start to talk about this as a CPI-plus type of business. So we think this service is certainly an essential service and should command CPI-plus level pricing. So 3% to 4% this year is certainly -- it's something we passed along, and we're seeing it stick. We just feel like the service is just too valuable, not to price it at those levels. And then secondly, when you look at the SG&A levels across the business, it's good to see the improvements that we're seeing in our cost structure. I think in the quarter, we talked about a 20 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales. But when you unpack that, you see that we spent roughly 50 basis points more on growth-oriented investments but 70 basis points less of back office costs. And I think that's representative of the work we're doing to improve the effectiveness and the productivity of our business. We feel like there's more to come, but we certainly are happy with the progress we're making there. Operator : And our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Sorry, [indiscernible] again. Apologies if I missed this one, but what was the exit growth for residential? I believe the 10% was for the entire company, but what was it for resi? Kenneth Krause : Yes, it was 10.8% to put a fine point on it for the entire company. And for residential, it was 8%. Jerry Gahlhoff : For February and March. Kenneth Krause : Yes, for February and March. Yes. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you all at our upcoming investor conference. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce your host Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Burton.

Management will make some opening remarks and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 8.7% to $892 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines as total residential revenue increased 6.3%, commercial rose 9.9%, and termite and ancillary was up 11.8% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business. As you would expect, we made strategic investments in incremental sales, staffing and marketing activities during the quarter. We will continue to invest throughout Q3 to ensure that we remain top of mind and well-positioned for share gains as peak pest season continues. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front so that our people are on boarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. This also means that we are positioned to convert our marketing and sales investments into new customer growth. Our team continuously challenges itself to think of new and different ways to enhance the relevance the relevance of our brands with current and future customers. Earlier in the summer, our creative team at Orkin partnered with Emmy nominated composer, Bryan Rheude, to compose a seven-act symphony crafted entirely around the historic emergence of two broods of cicadas. We hosted the Orkinstra symphony live in Springfield, Illinois, with curated music composed to accompany the recorded songs and rhythms of trillions of cicadas. The event garnered hundreds of millions of impressions for the Orkin brand, and support for this unique initiative continues as the symphony is currently available on all streaming platforms. In fact, I listened to it again just the other day on a flight and found it to be very relaxing. I encourage you to check it out. On the commercial side of the business, investments we've made to capitalize on a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity in the B2B space continue to pay dividends. Our new commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our salesforce, and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 26 tuck-in deals in the first six months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure, and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Safety remains an important area of focus. In Q2, we enhanced our onboarding program for new teammates by providing more robust safety training, with an emphasis on how we equip our new drivers with the technical skills, awareness and courtesy needed to be safe on our roads and in the neighborhoods we serve. Our efforts continue to yield solid driver safety scores and further reinforce the culture of safety we strive to promote throughout our company. We continue to look for ways to modernize our company, and to that end, our Board of Directors recently amended and restated our bylaws to transition from a classified board structure to a declassified one. Going forward, board members that are up for reelection will be elected to one year terms. This step aligns with corporate governance best practices. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Demand from our customers remained strong with over 7% organic growth in the quarter, and for the first half of the year. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Krause : Thanks Jerry and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start, we delivered Q2 revenue growth of 8.7% year-over-year with organic growth of 7.7%. That was at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we discussed in our recent Investor Day. Despite having two less business days in June relative to the prior year, through the first half of the year, the team delivered total revenue growth of 10.9% and solid organic revenue growth of 7.6%. Incremental EBITDA margins were over 30% for the first half of the year and approached 40% in the second quarter, ahead of the metrics we discussed in our recent Investor Day, driven by strong leverage throughout the P&L. And last but not least, our team delivered operating cash flow of $145 million and free cash flow of $136 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow approximates $273 million and free cash flow approximates $257 million, both growing 10% with very healthy conversion. Driving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Residential revenues increased 6.3%, commercial pest control rose 9.9%, and our termite and ancillary services increased by 11.8%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 5.4% in residential, 8.6% in commercial, and 11.1% in termite and ancillary services. Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were 54%, up 80 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. We realized improvements across several cost categories, with the most notable contributions coming from fleet and insurance and claims. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 60 basis points versus last year. While we saw improvements in insurance claims activity, we also saw leverage across several cost categories. We did see some leverage from customer acquisition costs in the quarter, but we continue to focus on driving demand for our services and expect to make additional investments in these areas during the third quarter. Second quarter GAAP operating income was $182 million, up approximately 18% year-over-year on 8.7% revenue growth. Operating margins were 20.4%, up 150 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins and solid expense leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $210 million, up over 15% and representing a 23.6% margin. Margins were up 140 basis points versus last year, and adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were approaching 40%, supported by benefits from more favorable claims activity as well as underlying leverage in more traditional operating expense categories. I'm pleased with the strong improvements in profitability in the quarter and for the first half of 2024. We delivered solid growth with an improving margin profile and remain focused on investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter. Our ETR was 25.3% for the first half, and we expect this rate to approximate 26% for the year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.27 per share, increasing approximately 23% from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. For the second quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated primarily with the Fox acquisition related items totaling approximately $4 million of pretax expense in the quarter. Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $132 million, or $0.27 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest costs. Speaking of interest costs, we expect a similar run rate in these costs for the second half relative to the first half. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $145 million and we generated $136 million of free cash flow. This is slightly down versus last year, driven by working capital timing. With that said, I'm pleased with the 10% growth in first half cash flow. Our business remains very well-positioned to continue to deliver healthy cash flow performance, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow, was over 100% for the quarter, as well as for the first six months. We made acquisitions totaling $35 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-times on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is very healthy and it positions us well heading into the second half of the year. In closing, our performance this quarter and throughout the first half of 2024 continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We continue to focus on driving growth while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the second half with healthy organic demand, and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please proceed. Tim Mulrooney : Jerry, Ken, good morning. Jerry Gahlhoff : Good morning. Kenneth Krause : Morning. Tim Mulrooney : Just one from me on the profitability. Strong profitability seems to be the theme of the quarter here, so I wanted to dig in a little bit on this. Ken, as you highlighted in your prepared remarks, your incremental margins were very strong in the quarter, approaching 40%. But I know there were some elevated claims activity in the prior year period, if I'm remembering correctly. So, if we exclude that, then how did your incremental margins look? Were they still above that historical average range of 25% to 30%? Kenneth Krause : Thank you for the question, Tim. Appreciate that. And it's a great question, something that we certainly took a close look at as we prepared for the call and reviewed the quarter. And what we found was business -- the performance continues to be exceptional. The margin performance was incredibly healthy. We saw leverage across gross margin. We also saw improvements in SG&A. As you indicated, our quarterly incremental margin approached 40%. If you exclude some of those non-operational items, I would call it our incremental margins were still at or above 30%. And that's the pace that we like to see. And in fact, if we go back a couple of years, we've seen some great improvement on those margins. So, it's good to see those margins coming in, even without the benefit of some of those non-operational items at or above the 30% range. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you very much. Nice quarter, guys. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Really strong momentum in the business. But if I had to nitpick on consumer, we did see improvement in the organic growth compared to first quarter, but it's trending slightly below what we've seen historically. So, I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on that front. What are we seeing on recurring versus ad hoc services. And also, was there any impact of the two fewer working days in June? Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : So, Ashish, this is Jerry. So, when we look at the quarter, I'll start with the two fewer working days in June. I mean, that was a pretty significant impact for us in the quarter. You're in the thick of your peak season right in the middle of the year to have two or fewer workdays. More than anything, even though we had a bit of a softer June last year, it affected productivity fairly significantly about ability to get work done and things along those lines. So, I would much rather have those two extra days in a June than I would in an April very early, very early in the quarter. So that's interesting. And there was some impact there. The recurring business is the additions to our new customer growth are actually outpacing our organic revenue growth. So that's healthy. So, when you think about the consumer side of it, the one-time business, while it's still there, it may be a little softer on some of the residential pest control, but we still see a very strong consumer in the marketplace. That consumer, when you look at our termite and ancillary growth in the double-digit range, that tells you, you still have a healthy consumer that really is staying in their home. There's a lot less relocation going on. People are staying at home, investing in their homes and certainly buying things like pest control and adding that to their home services. That is still remaining very, very healthy. So, we haven't really seen any shift from a consumer side in that regard either. Would you add anything to that, Ken? Kenneth Krause : The only thing I would say is we had, what was it, 5.4% residential growth. And so when you look at the one-time or the recurring business was at or above 6% in the quarter. And when you take into consideration some of those factors you described, I mean, they certainly had an -- they have a potential of having an impact on the overall growth rate. So, we feel good about the level of growth we saw in the quarter, the level of activity around customers and the demand levels we continue to see going into the third quarter. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And maybe on my follow up, if I can ask a quick question on the commercial side, you talked about the investments there to capture -- capitalize. I was wondering if you could talk about, are there certain verticals where you're seeing stronger demand environment. Thanks. Jerry Gahlhoff : We -- I don't think we've seen necessarily a stronger demand in certain verticals. What -- where we're getting our results is by building the biggest and best salesforce on the commercial side that we can -- that is possible out there. We continue to add to our salesforce, invest in their training, invest in development and building a very strong cohesive team on the commercial sales side. That's really what's paying dividends, not necessarily one vertical or another. I think we're out there just trying to capture new business through the new people that we're adding to our team. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. Thanks and congrats on a solid quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ashish. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Is there any way to estimate -- morning. Any way to estimate how much impact the two fewer working days in June affected organic growth in each of your segments. Was the impact greater in certain segments than others? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah. I don't think it was greater in certain segments than others, necessarily. Although, my intuition tells me it affected us more in the residential pest and then maybe a little bit on the termite and ancillary because those are often larger jobs that take time to get, take time to complete. And when you talk about having two fewer days in a month, in a month like June, it will result in some of that work carrying over, not being completed into July. That last year would have been completed in June. So, it's really that kind of impact, more probably on the residential, both pest, and termite and ancillary than on the commercial side. Kenneth Krause : And it can probably impact both one time as well as recurring business because we don't have the opportunity to get out and maybe start the recurring business because we're losing those days. And we're also just not seeing the calls from the one-time because we don't have those days, right? You don't get as much one-time in the very -- in the peak of the peak season. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. On the residential side, you also mentioned that you're seeing healthy demand levels heading into 3Q. What kind of acceleration would be possible given the exit rates that you've been seeing for the residential business? Kenneth Krause : Yeah. I wouldn't want to say that we're seeing acceleration in the Q3, but we continue to see just consistent levels of demand for our services and very much giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on the range of growth that we provided at Investor Day of roughly 7% to 8% organic growth. I mean, through the first six months were 7.6% and in the quarter we were at the high end of the range. So, we feel good about this business and the ability to drive value for all of our stakeholders when we're seeing demand levels like we saw here in Q2. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Hilary Lee : Hi, guys. This is Hilary Lee on for Toni Kaplan. So, just wanted to talk about the trends that you're kind of seeing in residential and commercial. Like, what -- did you see any changes throughout the months in 2Q, and what have you seen into July so far? Kenneth Krause : The trends have been positive. Demand remains healthy, and both resi as well as commercial, all giving us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver that 7% to 8% of organic growth that I just spoke about. And so, generally, as Jerry indicated, it was unfortunate the way the calendar fell where you lose a couple of days in peak season, but we certainly continue to see the things that are in our control give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goals that we've set for ourselves. Jerry Gahlhoff : That's exactly right, Ken. We don't really see any headwinds that could have some significant impact on what we continue to see. Hilary Lee : Got it. And just to kind of dovetail off that, it's been kind of a -- not unusually, but warmer July than in recent memory. Do you expect that to kind of help out with the peak season this year, and any indication on what you guys do with taking care of the cicada issue, or is that not really an issue for you guys to handle, even though regarding the symphony as well? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah. I've given up a long time ago trying to predict the weather and what bugs are going to do and pests are going to do about the weather. And so, generally speaking, warmer weather is good for business, but you just never know how fast that could change. If you recall back last year in June, we went through that cold spell and a little bit of June that softened for a couple of weeks there. And then in July, it picked back up and things went crazy again. So, you just kind of never know what's in store in terms of the weather. And we really don't think too much about the weather. In terms of the cicadas, Ashish is probably still listening. He asked about the cicadas. They're typically, to a consumer, not a pest, not a while they are a perceived pest problem. It's not something we can do much about. As I mentioned, you're talking about millions, potentially trillions of cicadas, and the extent that you would have to go through to quiet them down would be pretty extreme. That's not something we necessarily do. Instead, we've chosen to have a little fun with it, create some consumer demand and build some brand recognition around the attention that the cicadas are getting. Not really a pest problem, however. On the weather -- just adding on the weather, you are right. You see statistics about warming environment and things like that. But the other side of it is you just never know what hurricane season might look like here. As you get into August and September, I think a lot of people are predicting a pretty tough hurricane season. So that could have a disruption, a short-term disruption, but you just never know. I mean, overall, when we look at the things we control and we look at what we're doing, we feel good about the demand levels that we're seeing across our business. Hilary Lee : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please proceed. Heather Balsky : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to drill down on commentary around investing in marketing and customer acquisition. Just how your -- just the pace of it this quarter, how you're thinking about it in the back half and what you're seeing from the competition as well. Kenneth Krause : From a competitive standpoint, I don't know that we pay a lot of attention to what's going on in that regard. We kind of look at our business and know what our needs are and measure things on a market-to-market basis. You have to remember, we're still in a very highly fragmented business with a lot of competition, and that includes regional competitors and everything is just so local. So, from that standpoint, that just is one of the most dynamic things that we do that can change week to week, sometimes day to day. I will say philosophically, if you look back to how say, the digital marketplace was 10 or five to 10 years ago compared to today, it has shifted. And some of that philosophy has shifted over the last few years where we used to spend a lot of our money on the advertising and especially in digital, digital performance, a lot of that was spent, say, late April into September. So, you have this curve with a spike that really went right in the middle of season. And what we've seen now is now that we have these shoulder seasons of pest activity, you've got generally warmer environments, that curve is kind of softened in the middle. And we put more of our dollars on both tails of that curve where we're now starting. A lot of the, lot of those processes on the digital side are now starting in March and running well into October, maybe even early November if the weather holds up and the demand is still good. So, we now kind of -- we really spread it out a little differently than we used to do just because of some of the climate weather dynamics that are out there. So -- but at the same time, even within those quarters, even within that, call it nine-month period of time where we spend most of our marketing, it's still a pretty dynamic decision making process. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, dynamic. And to the point of, like when you look at this quarter and you try to understand the impact of that, you saw a little bit less, you saw some leverage in our selling and marketing costs. And some of that was in the advertising area, as we had pointed out in our presentation that's posted online. What we're seeing, though, is we're ramping that investment here into Q3, and so to take advantage of that longer shoulder season. And so, we're expecting to see a bit of an uptick in these advertising efforts here as we go throughout July because the markets are very healthy for us. Heather Balsky : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Please proceed. Joshua Chan : Hi. Good morning, Jerry and Ken. Maybe sticking with marketing, I know that across your brand you do a variety of different channels of marketing. Are there certain channels that are more successful this particular year than other channels that you've noticed? Jerry Gahlhoff : I don't think any of the channels are necessarily any better or any worse. I think we're doing well in all of them. And it's really about having a balanced approach, balance of how you spend, making sure that we're spending our money wisely, getting the return on investment that we want. We don't want to just drive leads for the sake of driving leads where we don't have the capacity to fulfill the demand and all those things come into play. So, I think our brands and our businesses have done a pretty good job of ensuring that what we do, we're disciplined about, we execute to it and we measure our results and we measure our return on investment. So, it's been pretty solid across all those channels. Joshua Chan : Okay. That's great to hear. And for my follow up, is there any geographic differences in growth within the country that is notable, or are the regions growing pretty similarly this quarter? Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : I think -- Ken, we've seen pretty solid growth across the business. Geographically, I wouldn't say there's been any significant difference where there's some market that's radically lagging another market or part of the country or even international. So, I would say generally across the board, it tends to be fairly healthy. Kenneth Krause : No, I tend to agree as well. I mean, sure, we have things we're doing in certain brands and I trying to drive improved performance in certain areas, but overall, the market seems pretty healthy, whether it be the western United States, the southeastern United States. I mean, what we saw earlier in the quarter was, there was maybe a slower start in certain parts of the southeast, but they came right online as we went throughout the quarter and saw some good demand levels. Canada and our commercial business up there, continues to do well. So, generally, we're seeing really good performance in the business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yeah. And usually if you see those differences, it usually comes on the edges, the back edges of those shoulder seasons, or in the wintertime when extreme weather may impact it more is usually when we see more of those differences geographically. Joshua Chan : That's great color. Thanks for the time, and congrats on a good quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Aadit Shrestha from Stifel. Please proceed. Aadit Shrestha : Hi, Jerry and Ken. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to gross profit, it was up 80 basis points this quarter. So, it's another strong quarter. But could you maybe break out how much of that was driven by overall price cost spread versus the tailwind from insurance and claims and fleet? Kenneth Krause : Yeah. Thanks for the question. I want to say the 80 basis points of gross margin leverage, roughly 30 of that is your insurance and claims activity, and the remainder is just good leverage across the gross margin categories, the cost categories. So, fleet, for example, we saw some good leverage there. And so just generally we're seeing combination. As I said earlier, a good combination of some of the more favorable experience on the claims in the quarter, coupled with some operational leverage and prices certainly contributed to that as well. Aadit Shrestha : Great. And just to follow up, not really a follow up, completely not related. The 11% organic growth that seemed to have accelerated within termite and ancillary services, how did that split out between the two? Was one better than the other? Kenneth Krause : So, I can give you a little color on that. Both those service lines continue to grow very well. Some of the ancillary business does tend to be sort of a higher dollar amount, higher ticket price, and is a little easier to grow at a somewhat faster rate than just pure termite. But generally both are growing quite well. Both are in the double-digit range, and both have been very healthy for us. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, they've both been really good performance for us here, especially in the quarter. Continue to see good demand levels. Aadit Shrestha : Great. Thanks. And congratulations on great quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please proceed. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Jerry Gahlhoff : Morning. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch -- morning. I wanted to touch on maybe acquisitions quickly here, maybe any heightened competition for deals that you're seeing. And then from a strategic standpoint, maybe any areas within pest that are particularly attractive to you guys at the moment. Thanks. Kenneth Krause : We continue to be very acquisitive. I think we closed 26 deals in the first half. If you go back a few years, you were seeing 30, 35 deals on a full year basis. So, we continue to see good demand levels, certainly always going to be competition. This is an incredibly attractive market space and a lot of people were interested in it. But we feel like our brand of acquirer of choice that we talked about in May and at Investor Day and how we take care and invest in our people and preserve brands is certainly paying off for us. We continue to be very active in evaluating additional opportunities. Jerry and I have spent some time on the road the last month or so, and we continue to look for new and interesting ideas. And it's not just looking at new and interesting ideas, but it's about also investing in relationships with people that might consider selling their business in the future. This is a long-term approach. It's not really focused on an auction or anything like that. It's about how do you develop the relationships with people, so they're comfortable turning the keys over to something that is incredibly important and valuable to them. And so, we're trying to take the time to continue to develop that and we think we're seeing some good results. Stephanie Moore : Got it. Thank you. And then just as my follow up, sorry if I missed it. But did you say how July organic growth has trended? Kenneth Krause : We haven't. We've consistently said is that it's continuing to see -- we're seeing business that is coming in to give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the ranges that we've set for ourselves. And so, we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. Stephanie Moore : Understood. Thanks so much. Kenneth Krause : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. End of Q&A: Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call later this year. Thanks a lot. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Lyndsey Burton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Management will make some opening remarks and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin? Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. We would like to begin our discussion today by offering our support and encouragement to all of those who have been impacted by the recent hurricanes. I'm proud of the way our team has worked together to support our teammates and the communities we serve in the aftermath of these disasters. The Rollins\u2019 relief fund has processed over 250 emergency grants for teammates in need. And we continue to direct truckloads of food, water and other necessities to impacted areas. Our efforts will continue in the days, weeks and months ahead as these communities begin to recover. Turning to our financial results, our team delivered another solid quarter, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our team delivered these results despite some operational disruption caused by Hurricane Helene, which occurred during the last week of the quarter. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 9% to $916 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines. We continue to invest in growing our business and adding to our customer base, as the markets we serve remain strong. We invested significantly in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities in Q3 and we're well staffed to convert quality leads and sales efforts into new customer growth, which our results in the quarter reflect. On the commercial side of the business, we continue to make long-term investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities in a multi-billion dollar B2B market. Our commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 32 tuck-in deals in the first nine months of the year and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Tim will discuss in more detail, but investments we made to support long-term growth objectives did temper margins a bit in the quarter. But we remain on track to deliver healthy margin improvement and profitability for the year. In yesterday's release, we also announced a planned leadership transition at our board of directors. In accordance with the company's long-term leadership succession plan, Gary Rollins will transition from Executive Chairman to Executive Chairman Emeritus and John Wilson will succeed him as Executive Chairman of the Board. Gary was elected to a three-year term during our 2024 annual meeting and will continue to be an active and engaged member of our board. John has been with our company since 1996 in various positions of increasing responsibility. I've known John for 20 years and his experience and guidance have been invaluable to me as I have transitioned to the role of CEO over the last two years. I look forward to continuing to work with John, Gary and the rest of our Board as we position our company for continued success in the future. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth Krause : Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. We are now nine months into 2024 and we've delivered solid financial results. Year-to-date, we've delivered double-digit improvement across all major P&L metrics year-over-year and EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points, despite making significant investments in the business here in Q3. Cash flow continues to be strong, with free cash flow growing nearly 12% year-to-date, enabling a 10% increase to our dividend which we announced earlier this week. With this increase, we have raised our regular dividend by approximately 65% since the beginning of 2022, while continuing to meaningfully invest in the growth of our business. This is a reflection of our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our future. Looking closer at the third quarter, our team executed exceptionally well and delivered Q3 revenue growth of 9% year-over-year, with organic growth of 7.7% at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we've discussed this year. We delivered good growth across each of our service offerings. In the third quarter, residential revenues increased 6.4%, commercial pest control rose 9.4%, and termite and ancillary increased by 14.5%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio with growth of 4.9% in residential, 8.1% in commercial and 13.7% in the termite and ancillary area of our business. Turning to profitability, our gross margins were 54%, up 20 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. Pressures from incremental people investments were offset by leverage in materials and supplies as well as fleet. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue increased by 100 basis points versus last year. This was primarily driven by incremental investments in people to support our growth initiatives and the uptick in advertising spend that we expected and previously discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $192 million, up 8.3% year-over-year. Operating margins were 20.9%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $219 million, up over 5% and representing a 24% margin. Margins were down 80 basis points versus last year. And adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were 15.1% in the quarter, reflecting incremental investments in people and growth programs during the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter, and we continue to expect an ETR of approximately 26% for the year, which implies a rate that is just over 27% for the fourth quarter. Quarterly GAAP net income was $137 million or $0.28 per share, increasing 7.7% from $0.26 per share in the same period a year ago. Accounting for certain non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $140 million or $0.29 per share, increasing nearly 4% from the same period a year ago, despite a higher level of interest costs and the investments we are making in growth oriented initiatives. We remain on track to deliver healthy profitability for the full year, driven by solid growth and an improving margin profile. We continue to focus on driving further improvements, while investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly cash flow was $139 million, up a very healthy 16% versus last year. Free cash flow conversion was 102% for the quarter and 110% year-to-date. We made acquisitions totaling $24 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions of $106 million and returned $218 million to shareholders through our dividend. Additionally, we had just announced a 10% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This represents over two decades of consecutive increases in annual dividend payments. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-time on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are well positioned and committed to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. In closing, we continue to focus on investing for growth, while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the last quarter of the year with healthy organic demand and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Operator : We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : So residential organic, I wanted to ask about that. It's I guess, 5% year-to-date, still indicative of a healthy market. I recognize that, but maybe slightly below what we've seen over the last several years. So I'm just curious, how would you characterize the health of the consumer today? And could you maybe break that growth down between your recurring revenue stream and one-time sales? Kenneth Krause : We appreciate that. When we dive in and we look at the overall growth of the business, we continue to remain very optimistic, very confident in our outlook. We talked about 7% to 8%. We delivered 7.7% here in the quarter and 7.7% organic growth year-to-date. When you look closer at the residential business, it's an area that we're also pretty pleased with the performance, especially when we look at the recurring revenue in the business. Back in September, we spoke on a public webcast and talked about the fact that we were seeing 6% plus recurring revenue growth coming through the residential sector. And that's where we finished. That's where we've been for the better part of the year. And so, we're pretty pleased with that level of recurring revenue growth, especially in the residential sector. When I look at the business in the quarter, Jerry pointed out the fact that, unfortunately, we all had to deal with the effects of the hurricane late in the quarter. But if you set that aside and you look at what happened as a result of that hurricane, it probably had about a $2 million or so impact on revenue growth. And so we would have probably delivered organic growth that would have been slightly higher than the 7.7%, closer to the high end, the 8% that we have talked about in the business. So overall, we remain very pleased with the performance. The team is doing an exceptional job at delivering yet another quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : And the health of the residential consumer does appear still strong to us. We see good growth in termite and ancillary, a good acceptance of our cross-sell campaigns and other things. So if there's anything that's been more inconsistent, it's the onetime piece. And the residential recurring, that's what we're really investing in with marketing, trying to drive quality leads. That's what we invest in with door-to-door and any other type of channel that we go to is to try to create recurring revenue streams. And the investments we made in the third quarter will pay off for us in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year as our customer base is bigger as we head into the back end of the year. Tim Mulrooney : That's a lot of helpful color. I'm just going to switch gears really quickly because, Ken, I think I remember having a conversation with you a couple of months ago about really like when you're looking at incremental margins, you're really trying to hit that in that target range, not any particular quarter but more, like, if you look at it on an LTM basis, right? So that's kind of how we're analyzing the business, thinking about it from that standpoint. So I guess my question is, if we look at incremental margins on an LTM basis, do you expect them to be essentially in line with your target range for the full year this year? Or might that be different given the incremental investments? Kenneth Krause : We continue to remain confident in our outlook on incremental margins. With a business that's generating gross margins of 54%, we feel like the contribution or the incremental margins should be approximating that 30% level. And in fact, when you look at the quarter and you peel back the performance, you unpack the performance a little bit and look at it a little bit closer, what you see is that we spent more in selling and marketing. We saw an opportunity in a very attractive growth market to invest and grow our businesses, and just alluding to what Jerry just spoke about. So we spent a little bit more there. If you set that aside, along with some of the investments we made on the tech side to accelerate the start rate that we have in our business, you'd see an incremental margin that would be right around 30% here in the quarter. So we continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver 30% plus incremental margins longer term. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes, this quarter is more of a timing issue more than anything as we indicated at the end of Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I also wanted to ask about margin. You mentioned the growth investments in hiring more people. Should we expect further investment in future quarters? Or was this more of a catch up to where you want to be? And just if you could talk about which segments you're investing in and most of that would be the best. Kenneth Krause : Sure. When we look at the investments, this is a growth business. It's a growth market. We continue to see great growth opportunities. So we're going to continue to invest in the business. When I go back and unpack the investments we made this quarter, I would look at them through two or three lenses. One is on our service side and our service technicians. Because we know the importance of getting out and starting our lead -- getting our leads converted into starts, we have certainly invested in the service side of our business. That's probably about a 30 basis point headwind on gross margins in the quarter. The second area that we made investments here is in our sales and our sales engine and our sales people. We've talked about the fact that our commercial business remains a very important area of our business combined with our residential. And so, we're investing disproportionately in the sales end of our business and you saw that come through along with the increased advertising spend that we had here in the quarter to the tune of about 100 basis points. So you probably don't expect that level of investment every single quarter, but you're going to see us invest in this business following the various strategic initiatives that we talked about back at our Investor Day back in May. Jerry Gahlhoff : And to add a little color to that when I look back at Q3 of 2023 compared to 2024 on our staffing levels, just thinking -- just peeling back, just working itself. You think on the commercial side, we are looking at the data to say, hey, where do we have adequate coverage given the market and we're going to continue to invest where that opportunity is there. If it gets difficult to scale or the data sets that we've got good penetrated -- the penetration that we need and we have the right people in the right places for where the opportunities are that will certainly slow down. But we'll let the data and then how we're doing operationally from a scalability standpoint will help us dictate that. And then on the residential side, selling termite, cross-sell, ancillary business, those kinds of things that staffing is up double-digits just like the commercial side is as we continue to make those investments there. And the opportunities there, the consumer is taking the services and buying the services, as you see in our results. And we find that to be a very worthwhile investment and we'll continue to do that so long as the market holds it. Toni Kaplan : And I wanted to ask about pricing as we approach the end of the year and thinking about your strategy into next year. I think we've been in a little bit of a unique environment in the last couple of years in terms of we had the inflation and then it's been cooling. So I know we've been a little bit on the higher side on price in the past couple of years. Do you see that sort of higher-than-normal price level of increases continuing into 2025 when you're looking at your data and stuff like that? Just how are you thinking about it? Jerry Gahlhoff : So Ken and I just recently spent hours in a room together reviewing those data from our price increase results this year, and there's not been anything in there that -- in the data from what we see and what we understand about the consumer that scares us off of continuing to get a fair price for our service. And if we're doing a good job, we should reward -- be rewarded for that, and our technicians in the field should be rewarded for that as well. So we've not seen anything in the data that would cause us to change course from anything that we've already indicated to you. Kenneth Krause : Both internally but also externally. When you look at CPI, we've consistently talked about CPI plus level of pricing. And CPI coming back roughly 2.5% recently gives us no reason to step back on the pricing and pare that back. We feel like this is an essential service and we should be able to be rewarded. And we should be able to reward our service technicians with the pricing that we've seen in the last couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Aude Ashkar] on for Jason Hass. I wanted to ask on the commercial side. Just any update there in terms of the strategy around splitting the brands and adding to the sales force? I think there's eventual plans to create a second division. And can you just remind us there of the margin opportunity being able to capitalize on multiple branches across a single digital media channel? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We still continue to have a pretty long runway on the commercial side and how we structure that business, how we open new branches. And to your point about opening another division, those types of things, we're still in -- probably in the first two or three innings of what's possible there on the commercial side, and we're going to continue to invest in those opportunities. And even from a margin standpoint, the commercial side tends to drive some stickier customer base and just -- and a very appealing margin opportunity there as well on that side of the business. So we see nothing but good things from the future on that commercial strategy. And we're just, like I said, still in the early stages. Unidentified Analyst : And then just if you can maybe talk about the trends you're seeing in commercial between the national accounts and the SMEs. And just wondering of your guys take on advertising for SMEs relative to the resi side of the business, maybe differences or similarities that you would call out there? Jerry Gahlhoff : I don't think there's been anything -- any sort of significant shift in that space how -- from a competitive standpoint. I think we've been making a more conservative effort, especially within the Orkin brand to focus on the commercial side and our marketing strategy there. And we've allocated more dollars into the commercial space ourselves to do that. But I don't think there's been any significant shift in the competitive environment or anything along those lines from an advertising standpoint or a go-to-market strategy that we've seen. Kenneth Krause : The team continues to do well. Scott Weaver is heading up our business in Orkin in the commercial side and we're seeing nice results there. But also I was just talking to our business leader, Rob Quinn yesterday up in Canada, and he's talking about the good performance we're seeing coming out of our Canadian commercial business. Jerry Gahlhoff : Mostly a commercial business. Kenneth Krause : Substantially all commercial. And so really good results across both of those markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. David Paige : This is David Paige on for Ashish. Congrats on the good results. A question on termite and ancillary or just other maybe untapped potential in the residential space that you -- I guess, that the company is looking to capitalize outside of the current operators that you have. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We're always looking for new services and new opportunities in and around the home that we can maybe expand to. And some of those are geographic in nature based on construction type of the house or certain types of pests and things like that. So there haven't been anything -- there's nothing revolutionary that we've seen other than the continuation of adding more sales staff to increase the number of customers with more than one service for us. And that's why we continue to be so successful adding our home sales inspectors to offer those types of ancillary services. And another great opportunity is selling more recurring termite. We have a lot of customers that have pest control that don't have termite control that we can continue to offer that service to through cross-marketing, cross-selling campaigns. So we're pretty good at sticking to what works. There's so much opportunity there and we're just continuing to invest and drive that part of the business. David Paige : And just a follow-up on in terms of inorganic investment, given the robust free cash generation, the low debt leverage. Anything we should keep in mind for there in terms of verticals or geographies that you'd be targeting? Kenneth Krause : No, nothing noteworthy there other than we're going to continue to deploy capital and M&A. We continue to have a focus on delivering 2% to 3% of revenue growth from M&A each year. Markets remain very healthy, an incredibly attractive market, so you certainly do have competition from time to time. But we've been able to separate ourselves by how we treat the acquisitions that we bring into the fold and how we treat the teams and the brands. And that's a meaningful difference for us in our markets. But in terms of new markets, we see so much opportunity. It's such a fragmented, such a large and growing market, the pest control market that we're going to continue to remain committed to that area. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : You mentioned seeing disruptions to operations from Hurricane Helene during the last week of the quarter. Can you discuss which parts of the business this impacted the most and whether you expect any spillover effect in 4Q? Jerry Gahlhoff : So it was really the -- obviously, the Southeast United States, the coastal areas of Florida where we have a strong presence, both in the Orkin brands as well as brands like HomeTeam in Northwest, all up the West Coast of Florida and parts of the East Coast of Florida too as that storm had pushed through and had tornadoes in the southeast and central part of the Eastern Coast of Florida. So there was a lot going on there. We had a lot of branch closures for several days. We focus on making sure we are prepared for the storms as they're coming and letting our people prepare. We know that the more people prepare, the faster we can respond and get back to work if people are in a good place themselves. So we had a lot of branch closures for several days. We got back up on our feet after Helene. And then Wham, you get another one that caused significantly more challenges. Talking to our people in the field, number one, it happened very early in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. So it gives us plenty of time to respond and recover. I'm sure there will be some customer losses along the coastal -- the immediate coast. But I don't think that's anything too severe that we can't recover from. We've looked at our forecast for October and the future and there's really nothing there, Ken that we've seen in the Southeast U.S. that gives us a lot of pause about the fourth quarter, is there? Kenneth Krause : No, not the outlook. Not really impacting the outlook all that much. But the quarter, you look at Southeast, it was probably one of the slower growing regions in the quarter because of the hurricane impact late in the quarter. To the earlier question we had on the call, I do think that if we did not have the impact of that hurricane the last couple of days, we probably would have seen organic growth even stronger coming through as opposed to the 7.7%. So it did impact us. But as we think about the outlook, we feel like, as Jerry said, we have enough time here left in this quarter to make up for what we had in October. George Tong : And then as it relates to your growth investments, can you elaborate on what you saw this quarter that prompted you to step up the spend? How would you assess the possibility that growth investments will remain elevated at 3Q levels going forward if market conditions support it? Kenneth Krause : I think the thing that gave us the most hope was the fact that we were seeing 8% organic growth coming through. Leads were strong. Market was very healthy. So we continue to see that, and it's provided Jerry and I and the business leaders, Pat and Stanford, the level of confidence to invest. And it's not that we're investing in every single one of our brands at the same pace, but we did certainly were able to identify certain areas and make more significant investments in certain areas. And so that's really what came through. As far as the outlook and next steps go, yes, we're going to -- we can't say what pace we're going to invest in at this point, but we certainly are going to continue to invest. We firmly believe this is a growth market. This is a growth opportunity. And in order to be most successful, we've got to invest in our people and capturing additional customers. Jerry Gahlhoff : And I think part of the algorithm is that you want to acquire customers in the second and third quarter, build your base. Because the phones aren't ringing near as much in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as they do in peak season. So in Q2, Q3 is where you grow your recurring customer base and that's your bread and butter as you go into the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2025, is having a significantly higher customer base in which to serve. That -- and so that makes me very comfortable with the outlook knowing the customer base is healthy and strong. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel. Aadit Shrestha : Just going back to sort of the price. How did price cost spread trend in 3Q '24 versus, let's say, 2Q '24? And on a recurring basis, what sort of margin expansion would you expect from just that spread alone? And would you expect a similar trend in FY'25? Kenneth Krause : Hard to say what 2025 will be at this point just yet in terms of margin opportunity and spread. But when you're getting 3% to 4% price increase in this business, you should see margins improve. If I look at the quarter and I unpacked the quarter, we had 20 basis points of improvement in gross margin. But we invested 30 basis points in our service area. So when you set that aside, you had about 50 basis points of leverage coming through in the quarter in gross margin. It was good to see. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to deliver that pace of improvement going forward. But you know as well as I do that from a quarter-to-quarter basis, things can shift. Aadit Shrestha : And just a follow-up. Commercial growth has been pretty strong because of the investments you've been making. And do you see this sort of as high single-digits growth -- organic growth in 2025 as well, just because of what you've done already. And the sales and sort of ad spend that you've been investing into that business? Kenneth Krause : I think to answer that question, we would look at what we communicated at Investor Day back in May. And really our plan and our hope is to see commercial business grow at a faster rate than our overall business. You might see resi a little bit slower from time to time, but your overall commercial business should be accretive to the overall organic growth profile of the business as we think about the near-term and the investments we're making. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : [Jerry Kanlindsey] here. In terms of your decision to hire people at this juncture of the year, could you just talk about the timing? Were you trying to address a little bit of a shortage? Or are you trying to get people time to ramp up for next season? Just maybe unpack the timing of the hiring that would be great. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So I don't -- when you think about from a sales staffing, are you talking more on the sales staffing or the technician front? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. It sounds like you invested in both, so would be curious your thoughts on kind of hiring people in the third quarter as opposed to maybe in the spring, something like that. Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So if you have the right amount of growth and you have route splits and branch openings and things like that, that were -- and you're trying to maintain the right balance of the number of customers on, say, a service technician's route, things like that, we'll always add. And usually, that's that could occur toward -- more towards the end of season, in the third quarter where we do route splits and things along those lines. And that's the right time to add those customers -- or add those technicians. On the sales side, we have over the last several years taken and hired really year-round and continuing to. What we're cognizant of is one of the things I mentioned, is like how fast can you scale, how fast can you train the right amount. So we're trying to take a balanced approach rather than hiring a bunch of onetime a year, trying to train. Let's say, it's easier to train 20 people in a class that you have four, five classes a year and you're adding 100 than it is to try to add 60 in a quarter and ramp it up and because your success rate of hiring 60 versus hiring 20 and putting the time and attention to them in that you need is a little more challenging. So we've taken a more balanced approach to how we onboard and how we time those hires and add strategically over time. And that means we will be making hires throughout the year. I will say generally speaking, though, when we get into the fourth quarter, we do tend to -- especially on home sales inspectors on the residential side, there's a lot less of that hiring. It will usually begin again in the January, February timeframe before we head in the season. While on the commercial side, it's a little bit more of a year-round type of event. Kenneth Krause : It's interesting you say that and you finish with that, Jerry, because if you just look at the quarter, what we saw was we gained leverage in those areas in September. And so more of our significant -- more significant investments were made in July and August. We didn't see as much investment coming through in September as you did earlier in the third quarter. Jerry Gahlhoff : That's a good point, Ken, because a lot of that in the quarter was very front-end loaded in the early part of Q3. And then we kind of wind it down, yes. Unidentified Analyst : And then on the advertising spending, do you track kind of the returns on advertising? Some returns metric related to advertising spend? And could you talk about whether those metrics have kind of changed over the last, call it, 6 to 12 months or so? Jerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We do measure return on ad spend or roll off. That's a key metric. And that's what makes the -- and particular in the digital channel, so dynamic and where if you look at Q2, when we spent a little less. You're looking at the market, you're looking at the cost to drive the leads in the digital space and you're making adjustments. You may decide to hold off. You may have -- maybe there's some local regional competitors doing some things, and you just say, hey, I'm going to back off for a little while and wait for this to settle down. And then we're going to -- and then you're going to invest a little bit more a little later in the season and into the third quarter where you can drive lower cost of customer acquisition on a better return on your ad spend. So we're always looking at that. And we have been able to manage those costs pretty well to that point too of -- well, again, I know we've said this like a broken record, but we're still going to continue to be disciplined in our advertising spend such that as a percent of revenue, say, on the Orkin brand, they're going to spend as a percent of revenue a very similar amount as a percent of revenue that we have been committed to for years that amount. So it's a little more in dollars year-to-year as the business grows. But in order to do that, we've got to do -- we've always got to strive to do more with those dollars, acquire customers at a lower cost. So that's a metric that -- return on that spend is a metric that our team is very focused on and makes decisions behind. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Peter Sullvian : This is Peter Sullvian calling for Stephanie Moore. I was just curious, I know you guys talked a little bit about modernization of SG&A expenses, specifically M&A expenses in 2Q. I'm curious if you could give a little bit more context on how those cost-cutting initiatives are developing and the progress you guys are making. Kenneth Krause : Yes, we continue to make good progress. When you look at the earnings presentation, you'll see that the administrative side continues to improve. And so as a percentage of sales, we continue to see slight improvements in that area. We're pretty pleased with it in terms of the performance. But we continue to look at ways that we can continue to invest in the modernization of our business. And so -- but overall, we're pretty happy with the returns we've seen on the restructuring dollars we spent a little over a year ago now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn Atlantic. Oliver Davies : Just thinking into next year, and I guess given the investments you've made, would it be fair to assume you'd expect organic growth to kind of accelerate from the 7% to 8% range? Or is it kind of becoming more costly to maintain those above market growth rates? Kenneth Krause : It's -- I'm not sure if it's a question or a comment. But from a standpoint of our organic growth of 7% to 8%, we're pretty happy with that level of growth, especially when you look at the quarter and you're trending closer to 8% as opposed to 7%. I'm pretty happy with the returns we're seeing. I'm not sure that we're ready to sign up for increased growth going into next year. But we're pretty happy with the pace of growth we're seeing in the business. Jerry Gahlhoff : And I wouldn't think that achieving those levels of growth should cost us more to drive that growth. I don't see that there's some sort of increase in advertising or selling expense that we would anticipate at this point that would need to be invested in the business in order to maintain those rates. Oliver Davies : And then just following on, you mentioned the kind of investment eased in the back end of the quarter. I guess, is that true on both the sales and sort of digital advertising side? Kenneth Krause : Yes, that is true. What we saw, just looking at the numbers here and checking that. But what we saw is generally across the board, you saw in September more leverage come through the model than what you saw in July and August. And that's the big reason why when we were on our public webcast in mid-September, we talked about the fact that we were investing. We might see more investment come through. A big reason why is because of what we saw in July and August. Operator : Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to the management for closing remarks. Jerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
