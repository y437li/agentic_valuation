My name is Eric and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin sir. Kevin Lobo :  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update as it relates to our recent M&A activity and Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before opening the call up to Q&A. Our first quarter results reinforce the strength of our diversified mix of businesses which include implants, disposables, capital equipment and services that address a broad spectrum of the medical technology industry. With this comprehensive offering, we achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, up 5% excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange. While we benefited from one extra selling day in the quarter, this was offset by the negative impact from the unusually severe weather, which resulted in a high number of cancelled surgeries. As these surgeries are being rescheduled over the course of the year, we do not anticipate any discernable impact on our full year growth rates. All three of our key business segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine delivered year-over-year revenue gains in Q1 and growth was well balanced between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., trauma and extremities posted an impressive growth of 12% off of a tough 26% comparable which was aided by competitor recall last year. This growth was fueled by continued strength in Foot & Ankle, up 34%. Hip growth of 6% and knee growth of 4% reflected seasonality and some disruption associated with the MAKO acquisition. As publicly traded competitors, we were only able to start our integration discussions after the deal closed late last year. With that planning taking place over the course of the first quarter. During this period, we experienced hesitancy by our sales reps as well as some customers to move forward ending visibility around the integration specifics. Starting in April, we now have the benefit of a unified sales force. With this key step in place, we are well positioned to leverage our considerable sales and distribution capabilities to drive sales growth going forward. U.S. MedSurg was led by robust growth in instruments, up 13% as the team is capitalizing on the linked 2013 510K clearance of the Neptune Waste Management System. Endoscopy had another solid quarter. Medical was steady while Sustainability Solutions was slowed by some product lifecycle challenges. U.S. Neurotechnology had another stellar quarter with 11% growth at all three businesses, Neurovascular, Neuropowered Instruments and CMS registered double-digit gains. Spine growth was flat aided by double-digit growth in Interventional Spine. International constant currency growth of 5% was led by strong performances in Australia, Japan, India, and China. The latter of which had strong performance in both the premium and low-priced segment of the market. Europe momentum continues with year-over-year growth in the low single-digits. Most product categories had positive results, although knees were soft due primarily to lingering issues in some emerging market countries which we previously mentioned. We continue to expect this trend to improve beginning in Q2. Turning to the P&L. The year-over-year decline in gross margin is a function of the negative impact from foreign exchange along with price which was partly offset by the benefit from our GQO initiative. We continue to make significant investments in R&D which increased 17% year-over-year, while maintaining our focus on driving greater SG&A efficiencies. With our adjusted Q1 EPS of $1.06 we are confirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.75 to $4.90. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen :  My comments on today's call will focus on providing an update on our recent M&A activity. During Q1 we acquired Pivot Medical which was founded in 2007 with a focus on hip arthroscopy procedures treating FAI syndrome. Pivot provides us with a platform of innovative instrumental implants to efficiently access and restore the mobility of the hip with minimal incision. Hip arthroscopy is the fastest growing procedure in sports medicine resulting from improved procedural solution and growing demand for solution. This acquisition complements our existing sports medicine portfolio and provides our customers with a comprehensive offering to address a broader range of procedures. More recently, we completed the acquisition of Berchtold Holding, which achieved sales in 2013 of approximately $125 million to its product portfolio of surgical infrastructure equipment. Berchtold offering includes surgical table, equipment films and surgical lighting systems geared towards maximizing efficiency and safety in operating rooms and IT use. Combining these complementary solutions with our endoscopy division\u2019s existing operating room portfolio creates a comprehensive quality focused offering equipped to satisfy a wide range of customers\u2019 needs around the globe. Also during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies which we discussed in detail on our prior call. Our Instruments division is excited about this innovative technology which helps prevent the objects in the operating room thereby improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs. Finally, as it relates to MAKO, during Q1 we initiated enrollment in a clinical study of a total knee application using MAKO\u2019s Total Knee System. We are excited about this opportunity to further broaden the clinical application for this technology and anticipate having the Total Knee on the market in 2015. We are excited about these recent transactions and the opportunity for our division to leverage the considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to help drive accelerating revenue growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. William Jellison :  Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 5.3% in the first quarter, including a negative 1.1% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.4%, which includes organic growth of 5%. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the first quarter were $0.18 per share versus $0.79 per share last year in the first quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $1.09 in the first quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes a negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share from FX this quarter compares into the last year\u2019s first quarter is also negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share both from tax extenders not being renewed and also from an additional full year benefit for the 2012 tax extenders booked in the first quarter of last year. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter are related to a $340 million increase in the charges associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II and Neptune. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. No insurance proceeds that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included. Looking at sales in the first quarter. Our organic growth of 5% was comprised of a positive 6.9% from volume and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.8%. Acquisitions added 1.4%, while FX had a negative 1.1% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. This impact should lessen considerably as we move through the year if rates fall near current levels. Looking at our segments, Reconstructive represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 4.5% as reported and grew 5.9% constant currency. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 8% in the quarter, Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 11.6%, with continued strength in Foot & Ankle as we work to expand that market. U.S. hips and knees growth in the period were 5.9% and 4.4%, respectively and we believe the strong fourth quarter did hold some activity out of the first quarter. We expect sales growth to accelerate in 2014 and look forward to a Total Knee launch in 2015. Our International Reconstructive business is up 2.9% in constant currency and have low single-digit organic growth in the period. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our total sales in the quarter. At the beginning of the year we moved all of our Sports Med implants previously reported in our Recon business segment to a newly created sports med unit under common leadership in our endoscopy division. This business is reported up through our MedSurg business segment. 2013 segment information is also been restated to consistently reflect this move. Total MedSurg sales increased 5.8% as reported and 6.8% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by double-digit growth from our Instruments business and high-single digit growth in endoscopy. Medical had low-single digit growth in the period. Our Instruments division \u2013 keep I mind also now has the Neptune product back on the market after receiving FDA clearance and should ramp up nicely as we move through the year. Remember we were not able to sell Neptune capital last year. International sales were strong, up 7.1% in constant currency, driven by our larger OUS division Endoscopy and Instruments. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of our sales and delivered another strong quarter. Sales growth increased 5.9% as reported and 7% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology businesses and IVS, which grew solid double-digit in constant currency. Spinal implant sales were down low single-digits. In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2014 were 66.9% compared to 67.5% in the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates and price had a negative impact on the rate this quarter as we felt the full impact of the weaker Japanese yen and Australian dollar. If they stay at current level the year-over-year impacts from FX will begin to lessen as we move through at least to the back half of this year. Research and development expenses increased to 6.5% of sales versus 5.9% of sales last year in the quarter. This is a 16.3% increase in R&D spending over last year and it also reflects our commitment to invest in areas which we believe will help us deliver above market sales growth. Selling, general and administrative costs represented 52.3% of sales in the first quarter, and this included approximately $340 million of cost related to the Rejuvenate, and Recall matters. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $836 million or 36.3% of sales in the first quarter of 2014 versus 37.2% in the prior year's first quarter. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 24.1% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 24.4% in the first quarter of 2013. The rate was negatively impacted primarily by pricing and foreign exchange rates in the quarter partially offset by operational improvement and also from lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Other expense on an adjusted basis in the first quarter was $23.7 million compared to $10.8 million in the first quarter of last year. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher interest expense and foreign exchange transaction losses in the period. Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 34.5% while the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.1% for the first quarter. This compares to a 20.3% adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter last year. As we move into 2014, we expect the full year rate will run closer to 23% with a higher rate in the first half. Remember, an extra year of tax benefit resulting from the renewal of tax extenders were included in the first quarter of 2013 and tax extenders has not yet been approved for 2014, so no benefit for them was included in the first quarter. While our 2014 guidance anticipates renewal of the tax extenders, they have not yet been approved by Congress and renewal and timing of them is still uncertain and it\u2019s negatively impact our tax rate early in the year. We also anticipate tax benefits from the reorganization and move of our European headquarters to the Netherlands. However, this is not expected to be in place until the second half of the year, so no favorable impacts will be included in our tax rate until later this year. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and marketable securities consistent with our 2013 year-end level. We also had $3 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the first quarter at 56 days or two days better than the end of the first quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 175, which was an 8-day increase compared to 167-day in the first quarter last year and inventory levels increased in the quarter primarily in support of a Japanese ERP implementation. Turning to cash flow. Our cash from operations were $206 million compared to $236 million in the prior year. First quarter cash flow was lower as inventory increased in the period including amount to support an ERP implementation in Japan and our capital expenditures in the quarter were $70 million compared to $49 million last year in the same period. We still have nearly $700 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization. However no shares were purchased in the first quarter as we focused on close the new acquisitions in the period. As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 guidance remains unchanged with organic sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $4.90. To assist you in your modeling, particularly as it relates to the first half, we would note that current foreign exchange rates are resulting in additional headwinds with the total year impact expected to be approximately $0.10 per share with the majority of the impact in the first half of the year. Also as mentioned previously the renewal of the tax extenders remain in our guidance, however we now do not expect them to be renewed until later this year. Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have. David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Good afternoon. Hey, Kevin. Kevin, just starting off with Recon, I think, all quarter long we talked about the impact of various forces here in the first quarter and you talked about many of them. It's challenging to quantify weather, but you tried to do so in thinking about selling days versus the weather. If you could just give us some more granularity on, in your mind what was weather? What was seasonality? And why you're more confident that these trends begin to improve here in the second and third quarter? Kevin Lobo :  David, what I say around seasonality, that\u2019s something that we expected. It\u2019s obviously a trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years and that played out again this quarter. The weather clearly was not expected and it was obviously an unusual period. We expect that those procedures will get done over the course of the year. They will be rescheduled. So for the full year we don\u2019t expect that to have a meaningful impact on our volumes. Now obviously, MAKO was a different issue and separate from weather and seasonality where we had the first quarter of integration and obviously we had sales forces on both sides at MAKO and Stryker trying to feel each other out and understand how we they are going to work together. We\u2019ve spent the first quarter working through those plans and obviously that did affect the first quarter for MAKO but we are very excited we have our plans in place. We have a unified sales force ready to hit the ground. But to actually parse seasonality versus weather is not something not I could really do either. David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay and then maybe kind of a follow-up on the MAKO commentary you just gave. Can you give us a sense of now that the integration has been done, what does the MAKO distribution force look like in terms of dedicated reps, the capital sales force, and we'd love to get obviously some information about how MAKO grew this quarter. If you're not willing to do that, can you give us any sense of when you can get the MAKO business back to the type of growth rates we were seeing in the earlier part of last year? Thank you. Kevin Lobo :  So, as we\u2019ve already indicated, we are going to report in these MAKO knee numbers with knees, the MAKO hip numbers with hips and the capital will be part of our other reconstructive segment. We have our full scales force now will be selling the implants combining the MAKO implant sales force as well as the Stryker Orthopedic sales force and that\u2019s new starting in April. We also have separate reps that will be selling capital. Operator :  Your next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Hi, (inaudible) if you could just quantify the impact of just reclassifying some of the Sports Medicine business into endoscopy, and just maybe talk a little bit more broadly about your strategy going forward in that line? Kevin Lobo :  Sure, Kristen. The sales of Sports Medicine implants was roughly $15 million for the quarter. It was a small but very fast-growing business which we had separate from our endoscopy division. Our endoscopy division does sell many products into the Sports Medicine specialty. We have now emerged those two together and have one combined offense from Sports Medicine and we renamed the business unit Sports Medicine which is not part of the endoscopy franchise. We are really excited about being able to be built now a strong fast-growing sports medicine implant business and now combining with our existing arthroscopy business. Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay and then I guess, just looking ahead is the plan I guess to just grow that business more organically or grow it through supplementing through M&A? Katherine Owen :  Kristen we did the Pivot acquisition and that is going to be within the Endoscopy division. So that really rounded out a key gap. In Sports Medicine we are pretty well positioned in knees and in shoulders, but having a product to treat hip arthroscopy with the gap and we were obviously very impressed by the Pivot offering. So, I would say right now the focus on that acquisition which just recently closed. Clearly, endoscopy has a much larger sales marketing and depth and breadth that will be able to hopefully leverage as part of the Sports Medicine strategy going forward. Operator :  And your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed. Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Thanks, can you hear me okay. Katherine Owen :  Hi, Bob. Kevin Lobo :  Hi, Bob. Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Great, good afternoon. First question for Bill, are you still comfortable suggesting that about 45% of the total year's earnings will come in the first half? And I was curious in Q1 if earnings came in where you thought because obviously it was a little lower than what the street was predicting. William Jellison :  Sure, I\u2019d say that, I mean, roughly we are still comfortable with that. But keep in mind that there was a couple of caveats that I talked about which FX is impacting at the little bit more upfront than we expected moving into the year. And also the tax extenders that we talked about as well too. We are originally in pretty much for the full year on a more of an equal basis. It\u2019s still uncertain obviously when those will be renewed at this time, but that\u2019s also an impact that\u2019s affecting the first half of the year. Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Okay. So, couple incremental things to consider around that 45% it sound like. And then the second question I wanted to ask which was back on hips and knees and your comment you think things will accelerate over the year. I was wondering if you're already starting to see evidence of those surgeries rescheduled and things back to normal. And Kevin, maybe what your assumption is for the hip and knee market growth rate for 2014? Katherine Owen :  Bob, I\u2019ll jump in with couple of things, going back to your prior question, keep in mind we clearly did not have any visibility when we thought about the first quarter as to how should be the weather would be and obviously it had an impact and still talked about FX that also worst. So there were some incremental negatives. In terms of the surgeries I think what we would say is not really going to comment where we are right now early on in the second quarter, surgeries get rescheduled but they tend not to get rescheduled all in the same quarter that they were canceled, particularly if a division has a backlog in place. So, that\u2019s why we said we feel comfortable that those surgeries will get replaced or rescheduled over the course of the year for all the obvious reasons for these diseases. We generated these patients are going to suddenly feel better. So it will work itself out over the course of the year. We still continue to assume the reconstructive market growth somewhere in the mid single-digits and whether that\u2019s three to four, three to five, something in that vicinity. So there has been no discernable change in the underlying trends with the note of exception that seasonality continues to get more pronounced each year and based on the fourth quarter. First quarter, we anticipate the same trend will take place as we look ahead to the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2015. Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Just to (Inaudible) Kevin Lobo :  You broke up a little bit there. Operator :  Bob are you still there? Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Should be willing to say whether or not that's a new number for that 45%, I mean, you give us that previously, are you willing to say what the best estimate is for the first half of the year in terms of percentage of earnings giving all these considerations that you just suggested? Katherine Owen :  As we said previously, we still assume approximately 45% of earnings during the first half of the year based on the range of estimates we have for the full year and then, I think Bill outlined in his comments, some incremental headwinds that are specific to the first half and Q2 that are worth looking at when you think about modeling. Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Okay. Thank you. Operator :  And your next call comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Thanks. Bill, how big is the SG&A line? I think about the acquisitions you've made and MAKO was $20 million of the quarter on SG&A itself. So I am trying to reconcile with the addition of MAKO and recognizing that the efforts you're taking there, they don't happen day one. How does SG&A come in as well as it did? William Jellison :  Yes, so I think that there are couple comments there. So, keep in mind on the R&D increase that we had a piece of that is obviously from some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve been bringing on board, especially as it relates to a percent of sales of R&D to our total sales and then as it relates to the broader based SG&A side, I think that, you should assume that there were some reductions actually in each of those areas. So selling costs were down slightly as well as a couple of the key categories within the G&A area. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  And is that sustainable? This is you know that\u2019s one-time? William Jellison :  And I think that is probably reasonable to assume that the R&D side should expect to run probably higher than it did last year, pretty much throughout this year and I think the reverse is probably also true with the SG&A broader category. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  And there is nothing that's been re-categorized that's been added SG&A in some other category? William Jellison :  No reclassifications in place. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Okay, and then lastly on the disclosure that you're backing out from costs pertaining to the Neptune recall, can you be clear what those are? William Jellison :  Are you talking for this quarter? There were no additional Neptune recall costs in this quarter. You broke up a little bit on your question. Is that what you are referring to? Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Yes, are you guys still there? William Jellison :  Yes. Katherine Owen :  Yes, hi, Mike there is a little trouble hearing you and specific to the last question, was it around the Neptune recall charges in the quarter? Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Yes, I am just trying to make sure that we've got the reconciliation because in your move from GAAP to adjusted, it says that you are adjusting for costs relative to both Rejuvenate, which we understand obviously and it lists as well the Neptune recall and I wasn't clear why you'd have expenses related to that recall that you are backing out, but it sounds like Bill is saying there were no expenses. William Jellison :  That\u2019s correct. There were no recall expenses for Neptune in this quarter. The recall cost that you are seeing there were related to just the Rejuvenate matter. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Perfect, okay. Thank you, guys. William Jellison :  That kind of market as well as and we would expect that business to continue to ramp as we move through this year. Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan:  Okay. Thank you. William Jellison :  You bet, Operator :  And your next call comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink Partners :  Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, can I just ask you to elaborate a bit on your comments on the dynamics playing out in the EU Recon division and what gives you confidence? I think you said acceleration throughout the year in 2014? Kevin Lobo :  So, as you know, Europe was a sour spot to go back about a year-and-a-half for Stryker and it has been over a number of quarters trailing the market and we launched our turnaround and we\u2019ve now had four straight quarters of low single-digit growth. So it\u2019s sustained. We started off with Northern Europe being the area of primary focus and now I would include Southern Europe in that. So, Spain sort of performing well at the end of last year and in this first quarter, even Italy registered positive results and Italy have been a country where we were suffering the most. So I would say our recovery has been broad based across all the countries back to basics. We really have our management team performing very well. So it\u2019s sustainable four quarters in a row in a market that\u2019s still challenging market overall. We are performing well and obviously for Stryker, Reconstructive is the biggest segments in Europe and so, the implant business is starting to get healthy again. Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink Partners :  Great, and then just \u2013 with respect to the comment you were making about rescheduling surgeries in 2Q and beyond, you said that a surgeon's backlog might actually be prohibitive in terms of the surgeon being able to get that patient in. That would almost seem to suggest that backlogs seem very healthy at least in your customer base. Can you describe either anecdotally or quantify what you're hearing from your customers about expanding backlogs, if any and does that leave you feeling better than perhaps a few months ago looking forward into the year? Katherine Owen : Rich, I\u2019ll take it. I think it\u2019s safe to say obviously reading a little bit too much into my comment it was more around to give perspective that you can\u2019t make up all the surgeries in a given quarter and that maybe one factor. It was intended to imply that there has been a significant change in backlog that\u2019s specific to us. It\u2019s really just the factors to why we said and think those procedure volumes will be rescheduled over the course of the year and that I would go back, we are continuing to assume the Reconstructive market is essentially unchanged in terms of its growth with the noted commentary around seasonality. Operator :  Your next call comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, going to your organic knee growth, I guess, our calculations suggest that in the US at least, excluding MAKO, your organic knee growth was flat to even perhaps down a little bit negative? Was this a surprise to you? Is that calculation in the ballpark? And if so then that would imply a pretty substantial reacceleration through the back half of the year. Is that fair? Katherine Owen : Derrick, I\u2019ll take that question and for consistency sake we have said we are not going to breakout MAKO revenue and I know it cause us some challenges but I have to note you guys have your models and we\u2019ll get some approximation in there. We very clearly saw some impact as we talked about on weather and seasonality in the quarter and clearly Q1 versus Q4 growth is there is a big change and we assume that trend will continue this quarter. So those are some of the factors that you should assume. This isn\u2019t a linear trend as it relates to our businesses both in recon as well as some of our capital businesses. Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. Kevin Lobo :  Yes, specifically related to knees, what I\u2019d say is all of last year we grew at market rates in knees and so I wouldn\u2019t expect anything really different going into this year in terms of outside of MAKO if you just look at our core knee implants that we perform around market rates and we don\u2019t see a different dynamic necessarily playing. Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein :  Okay, thanks and can you spend a couple minutes on pricing, both what sort of the level of price cuts that were seen from Japan versus your expectations? And also it does look like on Recon pricing has gotten sort of sequentially worse over the last three quarters. What's going on there, if anything? Thanks. Katherine Owen : I\u2019ll take the recon comment and we don\u2019t break out pricing by specific product lines or hips and knees in our financials you can get the pricing impacts. We continue \u2013 for the three main businesses, we continue to see pricing pressure partly offset by mix and the total company price continues to be down at the 1.5% to 2% range. William Jellison :  And Japan price cuts, obviously we expected those price cuts and they came in line with our expectations. And specifically for reconstructive, we do break out pricing by segment, the first quarter price reduction was not very different, if you look at our full year price reduction, it\u2019s in line with our full year price reduction. Operator :  Your next call comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup:  Hi, good afternoon, just a couple of quick ones. First, Katherine, just, on the acquisitions, is the right math two months of Trauson in the quarter and then a full quarter of MAKO, there is the only two that have an impact? Katherine Owen : Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup:  Okay and then \u2013 and Kevin for you on trauma in the US, not everybody's reported but the big companies have. It looks like the market doubled. So almost 10% this quarter. Is your sense that that was weather-related or do you see a strengthening in the market overall? Kevin Lobo :  Yes, so first of all, not everybody has reported yet. And I\u2019d say, you do have the impact of the recall, the competitor recall from last year which inflated that competitor\u2019s first quarter and frankly damped down our growth rates, so our real underlying growth rate was even higher than the 12% we reported. Weather did does have a factor. It\u2019s not nearly as \u2013 it\u2019s not a one-for-one with sort of the slow down you see in hips and knees, there is not a one-for-one replacement trauma, but, yes, the weather does have an impact and was a tailwind for us for the market in the first quarter. Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup:  Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Katherine. Operator :  Your next call comes from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray :  Hey, thanks. Just one \u2013 a couple points to clarify, just I'd love to understand you mentioned some of the factors impacting the MAKO business as you got further along in the integration or really began your first quarter of integration. Could you \u2013 I wasn't sure if I understood whether this was hesitation among the sales force as they the typical sort of who gets what territory kind of questions. Whether there was some loss of sales force in that process or whether there was hesitation or sort of on the customer utilization side, if you could maybe add a little color there? And then I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo :  So to the points you made, I would say yes, hesitancy on the sales force around who is going to get paid, who is going to get credit, what territory am I going to cover and yes on the hesitancies around customers saying well not the Stryker ones evolve should I buy this or should I wait, can I get financing, or are they going to sell this differently. So the hesitancies is yes, on both two parts. The one area where we did not have an issue was on sales force loss. We did not lose any sales force, our sales forces has all been retained, but there was this limbo where you are trying to figure out and sort out who is going to be credit for what. Especially, if you look at Stryker Reconstructive implant people who are not getting credits in the first quarter, they obviously were engaged fully until they understood what it meant for them. We were able to clarify that over the course of the first quarter, so they are now fully engaged. Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray :  Great and then this reacceleration, if you could, Katherine, maybe would be the best person to walk through what the points and drivers are as you see through the rest of the year putting aside what we just talked about what Kevin just mentioned, what are some of the other factors you think that get the growth going again to hit your full-year numbers? Katherine Owen :  So, if you are talking about \u2013 I assume you talk about top-line? Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co:  Yes. Katherine Owen :  So, keep in mind, our organic growth in the quarter was 5% and so I think we are in very good shape recognizing Q1 the biggest factors that\u2019s a negative for revenue is the seasonality both for capital which obviously has stronger fourth quarter trends and then the Reconstructive, which I think is, of course that was pretty well beaten in terms of that seasonality trend. As the year unfolds, the benefit we\u2019ll see is the acceleration in MAKO as we talk through. Neptune is ramping up as it just got back on the market. We had to do some customer upgrades in the first quarter. We did several acquisitions that we closed in the first quarter. We\u2019ll start to see those attraction with those as the division start to take advantage of the expanded product offering there and\u2026 William Jellison :  And I\u2019d say, we are going to continue to sustain the kind of double-digit growth in Neurotechnology. Those businesses are all really well positioned with strong momentum, strong pipelines. So we expect that business to continue to perform very well. So we have a number of businesses, Trauma, Instruments division, Neurotechnology, we were very bullish on our performance over the course of the year. Katherine Owen :  But, I just think as you go back and adjust models, the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen as we talked about it\u2019s gotten greater each quarter or each year, is the seasonality. So obviously that\u2019s going to impact how the fourth quarter of this year looks like just it did impacted the first quarter. And then sort of the headwinds that we talked about around FX in particular that will impact the second quarter. So there is just more variability on the overall quarterly trends, but when we step back and look at the full year, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectations. Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray :  Great. Thank you. Operator :  Your next call comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Jason Wittes \u2013 Brean Capital :  Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wonder if you could help us out with timelines on product flow for MAKO, now that it's fully integrated with Stryker, and that is specifically the Total Knee I think you're starting that trial, I think that's still going to be the MAKO knee. I guess how long will that take to get on the market from your expectation, and when would we see integration with other Stryker products within MAKO? Katherine Owen :  I would refer back to the comments we made in the formal part of the call. We start movement in the first quarter with the Total Knees with MAKO\u2019s Total Knee system and we do anticipate launching the Total Knee on the MAKO robot in 2015. In terms of product iterations and next generations, we are not going to go into any additional color on that. Obviously, we do have plans to introduce Stryker implants in both the hip and knee side. The timing of that and the prioritization \u2013 I think that we are working through internally. We will likely be able to share some additional color at our Analyst Meeting in September where the product there is going to focus on the Reconstructive business in MAKO. But beyond that, we are not prepared to go into any more detail around the pipeline. Jason Wittes \u2013 Brean Capital :  Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator :  Your next call comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Hi, good afternoon. First question is on foot and ankle. Again, another quarter of 30% plus growth. But that's 3X the market, so Kevin, maybe talk about what continues to drive that growth and how sustainable it is? And I had a follow-up on Spine. Kevin Lobo :  Yes, it\u2019s the beauty of the Foot & Ankle business unit. We created this dedicated focused business unit only a couple of years ago. We obviously combine the Memo Metal acquisitions with our existing products and we\u2019ve just been driving market expansion and we are addressing surgeons that weren\u2019t using implants before. And so it has been difficult to predict, I would say, at some point the comparables what you think would catch up to you, but we are in a market expansion mode. We are just continuing to drive and gain new procedures with new clinicians. So, it\u2019s a fabulous market. We\u2019re very, very well positioned and we continue to outperform the market by a healthy margin. So, there isn\u2019t anything new we are doing, so the playbook that we put in place from the beginning is the playbook that we are following and because it\u2019s a new market, versus having to take share from existing players, the run rate for growth in still very healthy. Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  And then my follow-up on Spine, I think you said in your prepared comments that implants were down low-single digits. Can you break that out between US and OUS? And was that down low-single digits in line with the market? Kevin Lobo :  Yes, I would say that we \u2013 our performance if you look over last year we performed kind of inline with the market, at least with some large players. I would say that held true again in the first quarter or you have the U.S. down low single-digits, OUS, up low single-digits, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s been playing out over the course of last year and the first quarter was no different. Operator :  Your next call comes from Matthew Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to understand how you are thinking about the combined business now that you've linked the sales forces and are aligned there. Is that, I guess, like flipping a light switch do you think or does it takes some time now for them to regain momentum? Kevin Lobo :  Well, it\u2019s just like any other integration. So it\u2019s going to depend. I can\u2019t give you a straight answer, but what I can tell you is the teams are very engaged and they are very excited, but it\u2019s new and you have people that are collaborating together, you have that certain relationships are well established, but it\u2019s not something that I can \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be linear and it\u2019s something that will build and grow and accelerate throughout the course of the year. Matthew Taylor \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Okay and then just on the weather, were your comments on surgeries more related to any one segment, or is it more Recon focused or did you see it more broadly across your business is? Kevin Lobo :  No, certainly they are recon focused. If you look at our MedSurg business posted very, very good results, our Neurotechnology division posted very, very solid results. So it really was localized to the Recon business. And Spine to degree, but it\u2019s not that different than last year. Operator : : David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Hi, good evening. I wanted to ask just one follow-up question on the insurance business, I had thought that as part of the Neptune upgrade that you were going to place those systems with customers, so I'm just wondering about the 13% growth in the quarter whether you are in fact selling that again and how we should think about the actual revenue trajectory to the balance of the year? Katherine Owen :  So what we talked about, that\u2019s probably going to take until the third quarter in this year so we are really at a fully run rate because we did have to go back to existing customers and do a software upgrade for them. But we are also now selling, and we are selling disposables associated with that. So the comment still hold, I would say the teams are very excited obviously to have the product back on the market, given the features and benefits and we would expect that momentum to accelerate again into the third quarter where it should be truly reflective of them hitting on all cylinders. David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  That's helpful. And then, maybe just a broader question for Kevin and Bill. As you think about the long-term earnings growth of the business, how should we think about the rubric to the P&L? Just looking at the performance the past couple quarters, it seems to me as though if I look at the drivers you have the top-line growing at a pretty consistent solid rate, gross margins are coming down. There might be some discrete factors there but it sounds like you're going to run really hard to try to keep them flattish at best. You can manage discretionary spending and then you can try to get some financial leverage to grow earnings. Is that the right way to think about how you grow earnings in this business now in an environment where pricing looks like a persistent headwind? William Jellison :  Sure, I think that \u2013 I mean, those are generally reasonable comments, but maybe the one exception on the gross margin related rate. Keep in mind that both in the first quarter of this year and also throughout all months all the quarters last year, we took a pretty heavy headwind from FX in each of those periods and a large part of that has impacted at the gross margin level. So, if FX was even neutral, I think that headwind on the gross margin rate would be much reduced and despite the fact that we\u2019ve got some significant pricing headwinds in general, I think that we\u2019ve got some good initiatives to our broader based GQO team itself reduce those operating related costs in the gross margin area to help offset that. Operator :  Your next call comes from Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo :  Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, could you talk a little bit about the outlook for the medical division in the US, and the US capital equipment market in general now that the ACA has been in place for four months this year? Thanks. Kevin Lobo :  So, you saw our Medical division in the U.S. grew in low single-digits and it has had pretty steady performance. We are not seeing any discernable change in the capital equipment market. The same challenging market that we had all of last year, the ACA impact is negligible capital is still challenging, but our division is continuing to perform well in a challenging market. Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  And then on emerging markets, could you just talk about what percent of your sales now are emerging markets, the growth in the quarter, and how much the knee issue in Asia impacted your growth? Thanks. Kevin Lobo :  So, yes, as we mentioned in previous calls, the smaller market Asian companies, the distributor change that we\u2019ve gone through has lingered and that primarily in knee business. So that did impact us. Our emerging market as a total percent of sales is around 7% and we are having very strong growth as we mentioned in China as well as India. We still have a lot of work to do in some countries like Russia and Turkey where we are really starting from a small foundation. I am excited about the potential for emerging markets specifically with Trauson which performed very well in China and which we will start to launch in countries outside of China over the course of this year. Operator :  And your next call comes from Matthew O'Brien with William Blair. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just quickly on MAKO with the clinical trial that you're enrolling right now, I'm looking at the website right now and it seems reasonable that it will probably take a couple quarters to enroll. And then I think it says here about a one-year follow-up. So we shouldn't expect that rollout to come before that trial is complete. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Katherine Owen :  So we are going to complete the trial. We haven\u2019t given a timing on submission but clearly it\u2019s going to have to happen to be consistent with our goal of launching our Total Knee system in 2015. So we are enrolling, we have not gone into detail probably for competitive reasons regarding the trial design and some of the specifics. But it\u2019s all consistent with our goal of launching in 2015. Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay, but it seems reasonable that it would probably be later next year rather than earlier? Katherine Owen :  2015. So I would say\u2026 William Jellison :  I would say just hold for now and over the course of this year we will be able to provide more color. It\u2019s just too early for us to comment at this point in time. Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay, thank you. And just real \u2013 one more real quick one for Kevin, since you've got there, you got into that position, you've done a real nice job of building out your presence in some of the faster growth areas of orthopedics and you've done the Pivot acquisition now and your commentary there was interesting to me given how large that market is, and the growth opportunity that you have there. Should we think of Sports Med as the next focus area in ortho for Stryker? A big ramp up in sales and marketing presence there as a bigger chunk of R&D spend heading into that market? Kevin Lobo :  So, we have a number of fast-growing segments within Stryker and I would say Sports Medicine is one of those fast-growing segments, trauma is a fast-growing segment. We have fast-growing segments in Neurotech, we mentioned Interventional Spine is a fast-growing. So many business units that are fast-growing. I wouldn\u2019t want to isolate it to one or two or three and we believe that the combination of the fast-growing sports medicine implants where we had strong knee, strong shoulder and now very strong best-in-class hip arthroscopy products which that we acquired through Pivot combined with the endo arthroscopy business will give that a shot in arm. So, yes, I would say Sports Medicine is a focus area, but it\u2019s not different than it has been in the past. We are just going to bring a bit more muscle to it by combining the two organizations together. We think we are very well positioned. We have a number of new launches coming out of the arthroscopy unit that will combine with the Sports Medicine business. So we think the timing is perfect to bring these businesses together. But I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s something different than we were doing before in terms of focusing, we were focused on Sports Medicine. We just didn\u2019t have still in the implant side, so we carved out a separate group, did a lot of internal development, have now combined that with Pivot, so we now have really a great offering on the implant side that we can combine. So, three or four years, we weren\u2019t ready to really compete vigorously in Sports Medicine, because we didn\u2019t have a complete offering, but we are now ready. Operator :  Your next call comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Thank you so much for taking the questions. A big picture one and a detailed one, big picture, one of the things that you focused on when you first joined, Kevin is, what was happening in Europe. Can you give us an update on what that looks like? And then my more specific question is, is there any update on the timing for the reintroduction of OtisMed in the United States? Thank you. Kevin Lobo :  So on the first question, I take the first part of the question on Europe, I would say, we just had sustained strong performance. I had mentioned before four straight quarters of positive growth in constant currency in the low single-digit area. It\u2019s taken a number of quarters to get that in all countries. I mentioned last year that we were lagging in Italy. We have been lagging in Spain that story in Spain has changed over the last six months and this quarter was the first positive we saw in Italy which had been the country where we were suffering the most over the last two years. So, the business model that we put in place for the turnaround is working and working well and we are now sustaining that performance in Europe, as we mentioned before in detail how we have changed our commercial model, we are very pleased with how that commercial model is working. And so, beyond that I could just say that that the team is stable and performing at a high level. Katherine Owen :  And Joanne, on the OtisMed, unfortunately we\u2019ve proven that we have done a great job of predicting when we are going to get that back to the FDA. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gotten good visibility right now in terms of a re-launch. I wouldn\u2019t be assuming necessarily anything in the next few quarters. Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Thank you. Operator :  Your next call comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Dave Turkaly \u2013 JMP Securities :  Thanks. Did you say you're going to launch another Total Knee in 2015 in addition to the MAKO one? Kevin Lobo :  Not an addition. Katherine Owen :  The trial is being done with the MAKO robot and they had obviously releasing their MAKO Knee when they were putting this together. So that's what\u2019s the news that it\u2019s in the trial right now and we anticipate launching in 2015. The Total Knee and the MAKO robot assisted system with the MAKO Knee in the trial. Dave Turkaly \u2013 JMP Securities :  Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the follow-up in the fast-growing segment, it seems like there are some smaller players out there in the world of spine just like some unique assets there that are growing at a pretty good clip and given your performance there, I was wondering if you have any thoughts of incremental R&D to mimic some of that maybe minimally invasive technology or M&A spend there in the future? Thanks. Kevin Lobo :  Yes, clearly minimal invasive is the fastest growing segment in Spine. It is a focus area for us certainly with our internal R&D organization and we\u2019d certainly be open for looking at acquisitions within Spine. We did a very small acquisition. We did CoAlign in the first quarter and that\u2019s an acquisition that our Spine team is very excited about. So you should continue to expect that we will launch products internally as well as pursue acquisitions in that space. Operator :  Your next call comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity :  Hey, thanks. Good evening and thanks for taking my question, Just this is for Bill. On FX, when did you start to hedge? Does this start to turning positive, It\u2019s been a headwind, does it start turning to a tailwind for you at any point in time? William Jellison :  Right now, if you take a look at kind of the roughly the $0.10 per share impact that I referred to. In the first quarter we referenced it was about $0.05 that was probably the biggest related impact for the year, I think the second quarter will also be \u2013 maybe not quite that level but still at fairly significant level. As you move into the third quarter, there may be little bit of an impact yet in the fourth quarter, should be more at least balanced off based on where rates are today. If rates move, obviously that\u2019s an impact that needs to separately be taken into account. From a hedging perspective, we did begin to \u2013 we see some benefits from the hedging program already in the first quarter here. As we move through this year, it takes us I think we stated, kind of in the early part of next year until the hedging program is more fully in place but based on current FX rates that we see the impact should be pretty much more neutralized by the time we get into the fourth quarter. Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity :  And then once it's fully in place, does it become that there is \u2013 we shouldn't see any EPS impact from the hedging? William Jellison :  No, I mean, absolutely not. The hedging program is meant to really mitigate what that risk is, so it just buffers it in comparison. At some point unless rates reverse from a different level, right, you still have the positive or negative impact of that. The hedging only just spreads out what the rate is that you are actually paying within a specific quarter. And if you think about it, just think about kind of over, kind of a six quarter basis, that\u2019s kind of where we are purchasing the different components of our FX exposure. So, it\u2019s the average that go into that six quarter basis as we move out into kind of the beginning part of the next year that we should be looking at. Operator :  Your next call comes from Bill Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Hi, I just want to take a follow-up, just on the other expense line item, can you break it out between interest and other and whether or not that was materially off from your expectations? William Jellison :  So, I\u2019d say that, most of that was kind of inline, a little bit of that was actually from part of our FX exposure that we just talked about the $0.05 that hit us in the quarter. Probably a good penny of that ran through that category. So, that was probably the one area that was not expected because the transaction impact in that category generally, if rates don\u2019t move from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, there is typically no FX impact in that expense line. But as far as the increase in the interest expense side, keep in mind, we place some debt at the beginning part of last year and so the first quarter on a comparable basis now reflects that interest expense in the first quarter as well through and obviously that was planned. Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Right and then just relative to the share repurchase you mentioned there was $700 million outstanding. How should we think about your guys' approach to whether that will be completed during the year or is it still kind of subject to some acquisition activity? Katherine Owen :  It\u2019s always going to be subject to acquisition activity because as we stated, we\u2019ve got three primary uses, but first and foremost is the acquisition, dividends are second and obviously fairly consistent in terms of how those play out and interest that we purchased it is going to be the most variable, I would say that in those years we have finished the year with still shares available under the authorization. But that you should anticipate in any given year that there will be some level of buyback activity. Clearly in the first quarter, we had a lot of acquisition activity that was the primary use of cash. Operator :  There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo :  So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter of 2014 results will be held on July 17, 2014. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity and preview our upcoming Analyst Meeting. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to Q&A. We continue to see solid topline momentum with organic sales growth up 5% in the quarter. After adjusting for one less selling day. this translates to underlying organic growth of over 6%. All three of our business segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and spine contributed to our Q2 performance. Starting with U.S. Reconstructive. Trauma and extremities continue to achieve market leading growth, up 13%, despite challenging comparatives from last year. This was powered by foot and ankle, which once again achieved outstanding growth, increasing over 30%. Both hips and knees registered solid performance and accelerated from Q1, with 6% and 7% growth, respectively. Note that the impact of one less selling day is most pronounced in our hip and knee business, which would have added roughly 150 basis points of growth. These businesses also benefit from improving trend in MAKO which we expect to continue in the back half of the year. Katherine will operate on this shortly. Turning to U.S. MedSurg. We had strong performances in instruments, endoscopy and medical. Instruments increased 7%, driven by continued uptake of the Neptune Waste Management System. Endoscopy growth of 17% was aided by recent acquisitions but even after adjusting for these, still grew at an impressive 9%. Medical remained steady with a 3% increase. Sustainability solutions had negative growth in the quarter, but has recently received five 10-K approvals that will return it to positive growth starting in Q3. The U.S. Neurotechnology had another strong showing of 8% growth with neurovascular NSE and CMF all performing well. U.S. spine results were soft this quarter, down 6%, reflecting pricing pressure and some sales force disruptions. We believe that a number of measures, including strengthening the leadership team and bolstering our product pipeline along with our recent acquisition of CoAlign should get this business back to its normal rhythm by year-end. International constant currency growth of 5% reflects sustained improvement in Europe, as well as excellent performance in China, Australia, South America and India. These strong performances were partially offset by weak results in Japan as we continue to work through a challenging ERP implementation as well as the biannual price cuts. Most product categories had good performance although hips and knees were negative, owing to the Japan issues and from tougher comparisons, particularly in Europe, as we anniversary our turnaround. The small market issues in Asia, which we have alluded to on past calls are largely behind us and should no longer be a drag in the back half of the year. Turning to the P&L. Gross margin declined year-over-year owing to a modestly tougher pricing environment, product mix and negative foreign exchange. R&D increased in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales, reflecting our commitment to internally driven innovation, coupled with the impact from our acquisitions. Our focus on delivering greater SG&A efficiencies helped drive the year-over-year improvement in operating expenses. Combined with a lower tax rate we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.08. For the full year, we are narrowing our guidance on sales and EPS. We expect full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. These changes reflect first half performance, our expectation of accelerating sales growth and the impact of acquisitions on EPS. Looking ahead to 2015, we will provide specific guidance at the end of January as we do each year, however, given the recent opening of our European regional headquarters we wanted to alert you to additional benefits that will accrue in 2015 versus 2014. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate to improve by roughly two percentage points or $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Of this benefit, we plan to reinvest about half to accelerate our topline growth and drop the other half to the bottomline. Therefore, we would expect an additional $0.05 to $0.80 per share improvement beyond our normal target for 2015. Bill will share more about the European regional headquarters later in the call and we will discuss the reinvestment plans later this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be an overview of the recently announced planned acquisition of SBi, an update on the performance and expectations for our major recent acquisitions and a preview of our upcoming Analyst Meeting. Starting first with SBi. We announced the planned acquisition of this key player in the small bone extremity market in late June for a net consideration of approximately $285 million. Through SBi's focus on the total ankle as well as the upper extremity small joint replacement segment, we are meaningfully supplementing our small bone fixation portfolio with a comprehensive product offering. Importantly, there is minimal overlap with our existing products and we are well positioned to leverage our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to access the various surgical specialists that focused on extending procedures. SBi's STAR Total Ankle Replacement, which represents roughly 50% of sales is the only PMA approved, cementless mobile bearing total ankle in the U.S. With these products we will expand our customer base with fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeons. Additionally, roughly half of SBi surgeons are not currently customers of Stryker's T&E products. While we do anticipate some level dis-synergies in 2014 at we integrate the company, we expect to return to solid topline growth with a five year anticipated CAGR beginning in 2015 of over 20%, and with the recent success of our specialized foot and ankle sales force as well as the strength of our traditional branch agent sales channel, the timing is optimal for our organization to leverage this acquisition. Moreover, the addition of upper extremity small joints will allow the opportunity to focus on this important sub-segment, a market estimated at over 200 million globally. In sum with the recent launch of our internally developed reverse shoulder, our expanded offering in small joint is answering a key gap in foot and ankle with at the STAR Ankle, we fully anticipate building on our clear success in the extremities market. We closed the Berchtold acquisition on April 15, which is in the communications business unit of our endoscopy division. For this year, our commercial integration is focused on customer lead sharing with Stryker Communication sales team shared operating room table leads with their Stryker Berchtold counterpart and in turn for Berchtold to share operating room integration system leads. To date, the partnership between the sales forces have generated over 100 new leads. We anticipate maintaining separate sales representation between the existing Berchtold and Stryker portfolios through year-end at which point they will move into a single sales team. We have been pleased with the initial results of the Pivot acquisition, which closed on March 7 and is reported within the sports medicine business unit of our endoscopy division. Stryker successfully completed the transition of the product sales to our direct sales force during the first 90 days of operation while maintaining very strong double-digit growth. Since close, we delivered the requisite product and procedural training to all reps and sampling to those reps that covered the existing 350 plus Pivot customers. We will sample the balance of the sales force by the end of Q3. Turning to the acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies which provided us with the SurgiCount Safety-Sponge System and is now part of the instruments division. This deal was closed on March 24, and we have begun sampling the system and training our sales reps. Since the close we have added roughly 100 new customer contracts mainly through further expansion in our existing customer base, as well as in new accounts. Installations are ongoing that will increase the install base of customers to over 400 by the end of the year. With respect to Trauson, which provided us with a leading brand in the fast-growing lower-priced segment of the Chinese market, we are now well into our second year and are pleased with the performance and success of the integration in China. With dedicated leadership for both the premium and lower-priced segment, we believe we are optimizing the market opportunity, while remaining focused on the specific attributes of these two distinct markets for Q2 growth in emerging markets with strong double-digits led by China, Brazil and India, and partly offset by ongoing market conditions in Russia. Turning to MAKO. We closed in late 2013 and worked through much of the first quarter on the integration plan, which we rolled out to our sales force at the start of April. During Q2 we were focused on training our existing reps on the technology and its benefit. We have now trained roughly 20% of our 1,000 reps in the U.S. and are expanding the MAKO training capabilities to cover the remainder of our selling organization by year-end. While the integration proved to be more challenging than anticipated, we believe we are gaining momentum as robust sales in Q2 improved with six points in the quarter. Importantly, our order book has strengthened and we anticipate continued sequential acceleration and robust placement. We are also encouraged by system utilization which improved during Q2. We remain on track to launch a total knee system in 2015 and also plan to launch our key hip systems on MAKO next year. Finally, we would be hosting our Analyst Meeting September 17 at our orthopedic headquarters in New Jersey starting at 10 :30. We are restructuring the meeting's agenda to provide greater visibility into certain businesses or key opportunities for the company. Specifically, the meeting will include a surgeon panel focused on the MAKO opportunity, which will be moderated by David Floyd, Group President of Orthopedics. Tim Scannell, Group President of MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine will focus his comments on our instruments division, including the relaunch of Neptune and our recent acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies. For the international perspective, Ramesh Subrahmanian will highlight our expanding presence in China. Lonny Carpenter Group President, GQO will detail the benefits of our European regional headquarters, which went live on July 1. With this focused presence in Amsterdam, we are excited about the opportunity which include continued strengthening our European presence and organization, the ability to co-locate leaders in a central location to increase collaboration, drive greater efficiency and to simplify and improve the customer experience. And as Kevin mentioned and Bill will cover in more detail, we also expect meaningful savings as a result of our RHQ. Following the formal portion of the Analyst Meeting, we will once again have a product fair at the Homer Stryker Center. This year, the focus will be on orthopedics, including reconstructive, MAKO, sports medicine implants, trauma and extremities. In addition to the opportunities in many of our products, including recent launches and acquisition, the broader orthopedic leadership team will be in attendance and look forward to your question. We hope you will be able to join us. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Jellison : Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 6.8% in the second quarter including a negative impact, slight impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.9% which includes organic growth of 4.8%. We had a negative impact from one less selling day in the quarter and on a days adjusted basis, core growth exceeded 6%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the second quarter were $0.56 per share, flat with last year, while adjusted EPS were $1.08 per share for the quarter versus $1.07 per share last year. This quarter's EPS includes a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from FX and if foreign exchange rate stay at current level, the back half of the year should see only a slight negative impact per quarter. The most significant non-GAAP adjustment in the quarter are related to $160 million increase in the charges associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate & ABG II. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined, and again no insurance proceeds that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included. Looking at sales in the second quarter, our organic growth of 4.8% was comprised of a positive 6.8% from volume and mix with price negatively impacting sales by approximately 2%. Acquisitions added 2.1%, while FX had no material impact on sales in the quarter. Looking at our segments, reconstructive represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of reconstructive products were up 6.5% as reported and grew 6.3% constant currency, and increased 3.6% organically. U.S. reconstructive sales grew 10.7% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities once again had another solid quarter and sales in the U.S. were increased by 13.2% and grew 9.2% internationally, with robust growth in our foot and ankle business as we continue to have great success in an expanding market. U.S. hips and knees growth in the period of 6.3% and 7.1% were partially offset by declines in international markets of 2.7% and 5.6%. In the prior year quarter, our international growth was 5.9% in knees and 10.4% in hips, which were challenging comps. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 38% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 8.8% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis and increased 6.7% organically. These results benefited from high single digit growth from our instruments business and a high double-digit growth in endoscopy which included incremental revenue from recent acquisitions. Note that endo has a much tougher comp in the third quarter, however, instruments will have a much easier comp in the period as Neptune had a greater negative impact in the back half of last year. Medical had low single-digit growth again in the period against some strong prior year performance. Our instruments division has the Neptune product back on the market and should see additional improvements in the back half of the year, compared to last year. International sales were strong, up 13.2% in constant currency benefiting nicely from both organic and acquisition growth. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and spine which represents 18% of our sales increased 3.8% as reported, 3.9% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% organically. Growth in this segment was led by our neurotechnology businesses and IVS which grew strong single and low double-digit in constant currency, respectively, while spinal implant sales were down low single digits. In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2014 were 66.2% compared to 67.7% in the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates continued to pressure margins and prices declined approximately 2% in the quarter, while product mix also was a factor in the year-over-year decline. As mentioned, the negative FX impact should continue to lessen in the back half of the year. Research and development expenses increased to 6.7% of sales versus 6% of sales last year in the quarter. This is a 19.7% increase in R&D spending over last year, reflecting a higher level of R&D spending tied to recent acquisitions and our commitment to invest more actively in few key areas which we believe will help us deliver above market sales growth, including our Neurotecsh businesses. Selling, general and administrative costs represented 43.9% of sales in the second quarter. This included approximately $166 million of cost related to the Rejuvenate and recall matters. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $841 million or 35.6% of sales in the second quarter of 2014 versus 36.7% in the prior year's second quarter as we continue to focus on driving greater operational efficiencies. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.9% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 24.9% in the second quarter of 2013. The rate was negatively impacted primarily by pricing and foreign exchange rates in the quarter, along with higher R&D spending partially offset by operational improvements and also from lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Other expenses on an adjusted basis in the second quarter were $30.3 million compared to $21.3 million last year in the second quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher interest expense and these expenses are expected to run at a similar level throughout the rest of this year. Our reported and adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 22.4%. This compares to a 23.5% adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter last year. We expect the full year rate will be approximately 22.5% with a slightly lower rate in the second half of the year. The renewal of the tax extenders is still reflected in our year-end earnings forecast, which if approved will help reduce the second half tax rate. No renewal benefit has been included in our first half actuals. While our 2014 guidance still includes approximately $0.05 per share for the renewal of the tax extenders, it has not yet been approved by Congress and renewal and timing of them is still uncertain. We also expect some tax rate benefit from our European regional headquarter move beginning in the third quarter of this year. We officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam in the beginning of this month and will be ramping up activities and transferring some intellectual property to the Netherlands as we move through 2014 and into 2015 which will require some local tax country repayments. This move will also generate some tax benefits which are expected to further reduce our overall adjusted operating tax rate in 2015 by approximately two full percentage points from 2014's full year rate. Currently, we are expecting to reinvest approximately half of these savings directly into our business. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also have $3.9 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 57 days or about one day better than the end of the second quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 177 days, which was an 11 day increase compared 166 days in the second quarter last year. While inventory levels increased in the first half of the year, partially in support the Japanese ERP implementation and recent acquisitions, we do expect some improvements in the back half of the year. Turning to cash flow. Our cash from operations in the first half of 2014 were $572 million compared $592 million in the prior year. First half cash flows were slightly lower than last year as inventory increased in the period including amounts to support the ERP implementation in Japan. Our capital expenditures were $124 million in the first half of the year, compared to $96 million last year. We still have over $600 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as $60 million of share repurchases were made in the quarter as we focused on and closed a few acquisitions in the period. As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 sales guidance includes organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 and $4.75 to $4.80 for the third quarter and full year, respectively. This guidance includes the negative $0.02 per share impact of recently announced acquisitions. Also as mentioned previously, the renewal of the tax extenders remains in our guidance, however, if these are not renewed it would have a negative impact on our current guidance of approximately $0.05 per share for the year. Thanks for your support and we would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : (Operator Instructions). The first question comes to Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Thank you and thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with just the guidance change for the year. Since the street was already there, someone from the streets, that's a bit of a surprise, but they are going to range. So maybe you could provide a bridge from your own plan to where you are? Where you are up to date? The year-end $0.02 of that was from the recent acquisitions but maybe you can provide the rest? Kevin Lobo : Sure. I think that the primary reason on our guidance, as you saw, in the first half of the year, our performance was a little bit softer than what we would like to have seen. Again we had $0.02 that we just recently announced as a negative impact from some of the recent acquisitions that we have got and pricing has been running a little bit stronger, a little bit higher from a negative impact perspective, or at least at the top end of our 1.5% to 2% range that we have typically given. Also as you have noted, in the first part of this year, FX has had about a $0.06 to $0.07 negative impact on us year-over-year at this point in time. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Okay. Can you spend a minute, Katherine on SBi, to adding people, the sales there have kind of flattened out for over a bit, but your outlook has been pretty optimistic. So can you just talk about what takes that from a business that's not growing right now to one that has that 20% growth potential? Katherine Owen : Yes, and you are correct. We are receiving some sales force or some sales dis-synergy as we integrated into our business and there was clearly some distraction they had as we were working through this transaction. It really is a playbook as we saw with Memometal and other deals where we take great products and this is a terrific upper extremity portfolio really led by the STAR ankle, which is a meaningful gap in our foot and ankle portfolio and leveraging our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure, the demonstrated strength of the hybrid sales channel that we have that really allows us to touch base with all the various surgical specialists that participate in this market segment. So we really think we can reverse this trend with a tremendous amount of momentum as you are seeing right now in extremities and foot and ankle and adding this key gap to the portfolio and also further broadening out our upper extremity offerings. We feel very confident about the ability to return momentum there, which is why we are targeting that north of 20% CAGR for this segment. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel: Good afternoon, everybody. I guess, first with knees. Can you help us understand a little more clearly. Maybe actually I will start again. Can you talk a little about the knee market environment? One of your competitors is talking about the environment being soft or slow. Maybe you can give us some general perspective there? And the follow-up with that, what would knee growth have been excluding Japan or maybe help us understand the impact of pricing and ERP implementation on worldwide knees? Thanks. Katherine Owen : Rick, I will take the first part. I would say whether its hips or knees, we are continuing to see a market that's very stable. We did see sequential improvement in our business as you would anticipate given the challenges that existed for the industry mainly due to weather in the first quarter, but overall the market trends are very stable. We did have contribution from MAKO but even excluding that, our underlying growth in both hips and knees was solid. So we are pleased with the performance of those business. We did comment that pricing has gotten incrementally tougher which is behind the total pricing being down at the high end of our anticipated range. But that really doesn't reflect any significant changes in the market. It's much more of a function of the timing of product launches, where we are, for example, with Accolade II and that impacts that pricing from quarter to quarter. So I wouldn't view that as some type of fundamental change in the market, which we continue to view both segments as very stable. Kevin Lobo : Also keep in mind that as we noted earlier, this quarter does have one less selling day in it as well too. So the organic growth rate that we talked about are on a straight basis. And those are not a days adjusted number. Katherine Owen : And then you made the comment. We did have the price cuts in Japan which was part of the pressure on that business and as well as Kevin noted the ERP implementation. So those have been two of the more noteworthy challenges for that business. Kevin Lobo : And ERP implementations, as you all know, can be challenging. And for us, it had a disproportionate impact on our reconstructive business because of the sets and being able to track all the inventory. So we put more resources on it right now. In fact, I also hired a new CIO for all of Stryker, Bijoy Sagar, who came from Merck KGaA. He joined us in the second quarter. We are really excited to have him onboard. We do also have another ERP planned for our instruments division as we modernize all of our IT systems. But having a new CIO, I am extremely excited about. We do have a lot of work to do. We made progress in addressing the ERP over the quarter, but it did have a disproportionate impact on hips and knees, and we are optimistic that we will have that sorted out in the third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I have got a question to start for Bill and then one for Kevin. First for Bill. I was just wondering if you can go back to beginning of the year? Your guidance has been at the lower end of the range. You have revised it to the lower end of the range a few times and I am just wondering, is this all really surprises on currency and the $0.02 from the deal? Or is there something else going on? And then on the 2015 outlook, which we appreciate, does that suggest a little upward bias to consensus, which is now forecasting 11% growth? Bill Jellison : So I would say that you are exactly right in the first half of the year. So the $0.02 that we just talked about on the acquisition that we highlighted as far as having $0.02 of an impact as we move into the back half of this year is one piece of it. The other piece is some slight additional impact on FX in comparison to what we had in our original guidance as we talked about. Most of that, obviously, is impacting really the first part of this year as FX rates have actually improved a little bit, except for in some of the emerging market areas now. And then on the third piece is really that the pricing impact primarily in the recon area was probably a little bit higher, at least within the first half of the year than what we really expected. Katherine Owen : And then, Bob, just in terms of your question, we will give our guidance in January. So it would be premature for us to comment regarding what the consensus expectations are. But you are correct. You should view the $0.05 to $0.08 that we referenced as being incremental to the normal targets that we will set out at the start of the year. Operator : Then next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Demchak - Morgan Stanley : Hello, this is actually John Demchak, in for David. I wanted to follow-up on some of the prior guidance questions with focus, I guess, a bit more on the organic growth adjustments. Numbers show the company's average roughly 4% to 5% organic growth in the first half of the year. Obviously the increased seasonality and weather had a pretty large impact in the first quarter. Are expectations that organic growth should stay more at the 2Q levels heading into the back half? Or are there some puts and takes that we should be thinking about that could drive organic growth a bit higher? Kevin Lobo : So a couple of points. First, keep in mind that the Q2 growth that we just talked about was on a one day less selling day basis. So the adjusted basis in the second quarter was actually north of 6%. And I say that if you look at our organic growth in the first half, which was just under 5% as reported, and we just now obviously raised slightly the broader-based or near the range on the top end to 5% to 6%. That obviously implies that our second half growth rate is expected to be higher than what we have experienced so far in the first half. One of the reasons associated with that, as I mentioned, is on the instruments. The impact of Neptune on the back half of last year was obviously stronger than the first half and obviously as we are moving in through this year, our Neptune sales should actually be stronger in the second half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. So that's one piece that's helping to drive that but I think that we are feeling good and confident in a number of our different business areas to continue to take market share. John Demchak - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Very helpful. And just wanted to follow-up on U.S. knee growth. As earlier competitor reports showed weaker growth in U.S. in knees than we would have expected, but your numbers showed some pretty nice sequential improvement, especially when you factor in the selling day. I was wondering if you could discuss what you see in the market competitively and if you expect growth to pick up further later in the year with increased seasonality? Katherine Owen : Yes. I would just go back to our prior comments. The market feels very stable. We obviously don't have the benefit of everybody having reported results right now. But for us, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement. And we are happy also with making progress on MAKO. So both underlying and with MAKO, we are seeing improving trends. I wouldn't say we have seen an acceleration in the underlying average growth for the recon market. It feels very much like a market that's been growing at fairly consistent rates, recognizing we have the variability between Q4 and Q1 that exists. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So one follow-up, if I could, on MAKO. If you are providing a little more colors to and you see the rollout playing out nest year with knees, and then also with hips. I would love to understand, you mentioned sales trading, what's the model going to look like? Perhaps if you could shed any light on maybe how you are integrating the robot sales with recon sales and the support, as well as whether you are anticipating any significant upgrade to the hip software. That kind of color would be helpful. And then I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : So I will take this questions. So what I say is, at the Analyst Day we are going to provide a lot more insight into MAKO. What I would tell you is from a sales force structure, we have a dedicated capital sales force that's within our orthopedic group that sells capital and that implants are being sold by our entire implant sales force. So that is now of course a much larger sales force than MAKO had initially. They all have gotten the same compensation plan starting April 1. So we didn't have that benefit in the first quarter. The training that Katherine alluded to in her section relates to training of the implant sales force on the benefits of MAKO, so they can be prepared to sell the implants that go with the robot. And of course going into 2015, those implants will include the Stryker implants and we will share more specifics on that at the Analyst Day. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Great, and the follow-up, I guess, I appreciate the color on the ortho sequential growth. It seems very encouraging. Spine, on the other hand, still having trouble getting going and as you mentioned some sales disruptions, I am wondering maybe if you have any timing as to when we can start to see that curve bend up a little bit on the spine business. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So up to now, up until this quarter, we have been really holding our own very well in spine, growing at least at the high-end of the large multinational. So not the spine only companies. We have been actually holding our own and actually running a very good business from a top and bottomline standpoint. We have had some sales force disruptions that the market is incredibly aggressive out there. That obviously hurt us in the second quarter. This market is still a market that rewards innovation and we are seeing that already with the early response to CoAlign. So getting our pipeline back on track is really going to be critical to us to not only retain the sales force that we have but also to drive growth. So I would say it's going to take us a good part of this year to really get ourselves back on a strong footing. And then I really look forward to a much more optimistic 2015 in spine. But it's a tough market, certainly especially in the United States. Outside the U.S., it's frankly not nearly as competitive and the markets are lot more stable. Then getting back to your first question. I don't think I answered the last part of your first question around the hip. I would say, the recent hip software launch on MAKO is actually really good. So the software itself, the early iterations certainly had some challenges, but we now have actually a very nice software iteration. The issue for us is now getting our implants on to the robot. And as Katherine mentioned, we plan to do that in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, at AAOS last year, you were incredibly bullish about MAKO and you kind of went through the line of arguments as to why it provides a better option with modestly modified implants. Now you have a little experience under your belt. Could you kindly give us the elevator pitch for knees and hips with MAKO and what's really resonating with customers? Kevin Lobo : The elevator pitch is the same elevator pitch I gave at the academy. I honestly feel as bullish as I did then and now and obviously we have got integration, we have issues with our sales force getting them all of up-to-date but I would say the promise of robotic surgery is the same. Its precision, its reproducibility, its consistent results and we are seeing in terms of the knee in particular, which is much more challenging than hips, we see this as really having a tremendous potential and we are obviously in the midst of our trial right now on the total knee and anecdotally we have a certain amount of feedback around being able to do intraoperative adjustments. It just provides a much better solution to the procedure, which we know is a very complex procedure, which has high, high variability and not the same degree of patient satisfaction. So obviously, there's the link to improving patient satisfaction is a long link but we believe the surgeon experience will be a tremendous with that. So there is nothing thus far in terms of the integration that's caused me to feel any less optimistic. Mind you, this is going to take time. It takes time to sell the capital. It takes time to put the implants that we want the robot and we would be rolling that over a period of time. But I remain extremely bullish on the opportunity long-term. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : And just on financially philosophical basis, I guess you guys have engineered a mini inversion of sorts with a nice tax advantage that should be sustainable, but with regards to access to ex-U.S. cash, how big a lingering problem is that and how big an enticement is inversion, generally speaking? Kevin Lobo : Inversions are, obviously, in the news a lot lately, but from an overall perspective, we think we have made some very good progress on our RHQ structure related activities, which is primarily focused on the business itself and bringing the benefits of being able to grow our overall European business. But it does have some benefits to us within the tax side of the equation as well and we are very confident that we are going to be able to deliver on the results that we just talked about. Those results are on an ongoing basis. So we are continually focused and obviously minimizing our tax rate within that area and operating our of business as effectively as we can. We think we still have good opportunities in the future. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Thank you. It's Joanne Wuensch. Can we focus on two things? First gross margins. What is the take to turn those? Or should we think of the 66% level as the go forward rate? Then my second question has to deal with (inaudible), and I appreciate the organic growth rate of up 5% to 6%, but you made a bunch of acquisition in the last six months, in six to 12 months. How do I think of what that may add on top of that? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Let me answer the last question first and I will go back to the first question. But from a growth rate perspective, keep in mind the organic growth rate that we are talking about excludes those acquisitions, with the exception now of Trauson is beginning to be included in our organic numbers, because that's an annualized acquisition. All the other recent acquisitions that we have are not in our current organic growth rate, but obviously should help improve our overall organic growth rate as we continue and move forward over the next number of years. From an overall perspective, on the margin rate side of the equation, I would say that our expectation for the rest of this year is still that the gross margins will probably be softer than they were last year throughout the rest of this year. However we are still expecting that our SG&A related activities will also run much better as well than they did last year. The biggest pressure on the margin rates right now is really price. The price impact was probably about not quite half of the total impact in that margin rate at this stage and we think the back half of this year, at least from a pricing perspective should be a little bit better than what the first half ran. Katherine Owen : And Joanne, just maybe a little bit more color commentary. We talked about the sequential improvement in MAKO going to fix placements in the quarter. You should assume that's going to accelerate in the back half of the year as we train the remaining 80% of our reps on the technology and that's part of what is driving the accelerated revenue expectations. Also try to give some color on some of the key data points, whether its new contracts we have added or expanding our customer base with some of the other acquisitions, recognizing the revenue contribution there is certainly lower. So we tend to focus on organic growth since it really is the best indicator of our underlying gains but there is clearly an expectation for an acceleration in the contribution from the acquisitions with the exception of SBi given the dis-synergies we noted in 2014. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Katherine Owen : Sorry about that, Bob. We dropped you off before you asked your second question. Our apologies. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : No problem, and I had a problem with my phones. So thank you, and I understand there has been some discussions around inversions. But I wanted to ask Kevin a question specifically, and obviously there has been a lot of press lately about inversions and day before yesterday, we had some statements out of President Obama's administration. I am just wondering if those comments about inversions, if that might cause, in your view, companies might be considering inversion to be less likely to move forward, given the changing political environment? Just love your views on that, Kevin. Kevin Lobo : Sure. Thanks, Bob. I think it really depends on the main reason for doing the transaction. As you know, some of the deals that been done have been done really largely for financial reasons. In those cases, I think those companies would probably, it's a cause for pause, if the main driver of the deal is financial. However if the deals are more strategically driven, I really don't see it having much of an impact at all until legislation is actually enacted and what we are seeing in the press is the likelihood of near-term legislation doesn't seem very probable. So again, I would bifurcate into two areas. Those that are very financially driven, I think those companies will pause a little bit. Those that really are strategically, that's a bigger part of the logic and then as an inversion as maybe icing, I think those will continue to be pursued. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Great, I really appreciate your perspective. Thanks for letting me back in. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Dodds from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Good afternoon. On the pricing side, Bill, should we think about this as being geographically an issue at Japan and then hips and knees are the rest of the product lines geographies kind of stable or holding in there? Bill Jellison : Well, I would say that Japan was one piece of it. But I would say that and it's within our general range. We expect the price is going to be somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% on average in any year. I think the first half was probably a little bit higher toward the top end of our range, but the whole year, I think it's probably still going to be in the 1.5% to 2% range. But I think that if you look at where the business related impacts are, while Japan is a piece of it, I think the broader recon group was probably at least beyond the higher impacted area of our business. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: Okay, and then Kevin on foot and ankle, you gave another big growth rate number. But you didn't say this time to caution us to not expect it going forward. Kevin Lobo : You know what, you just defined my expectations. Honestly, it is hard to predict, these new markets are hard to predict. And I keep waiting for the comps to start to catch up with us and the team keeps executing. So I will be honest. They are exceeding my expectations and I am really delighted with the results. Katherine Owen : But with that, we do remind you the comps will get tougher. Matthew Dodds - Citigroup: The quick question is, why do you think the market growth is still above 10%, though, in extremities broadly? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I would say we tend to estimate it around between 10% and 15%. We are certainly outperforming in the lower extremities. Obviously the upper extremities, shoulder has been a soft spot for us historically and we now have our reverse shoulder out, which we are very excited about. But that's an area we are playing catch-up in upper extremities. But obviously in the foot and ankle area, we are just having a great time so far and obviously the total, that was about the total ankle. We have been growing 30% pretty much quarter after quarter for a number of quarters without a total ankle and we believe we have got a fantastic total ankle through this acquisition. Of course we haven't closed yet but we will be closing soon, and we really believe that's a perfect solution for us and frankly gives us access to a lot of us the surgeons that we haven't had access to the fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeons. We have been kind of on the sidelines. So it really does give us a shot in the arm. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that discussion right there with the total ankle in your lower extremities portfolio. Now that you have filled out your last remaining gap, do you think that, and now that you see this great opportunity in front of you, do you feel that the current sales force that you have is sufficient or do you expect to make further investment into your sales force to drive that growth moving forward? Katherine Owen : We do have a hybrid model and we also have distributors as well as direct agents and that model has worked very well between our trauma, our reconstructive hybrid reps and our dedicated foot and ankle reps. Over time, we will look to possibly reevaluate the approach in upper extremities and it's possible but at this point as we analyze all the call points we have and the breadth of the various aspects of our selling organization, we think we are pretty well covered. So we don't believe we need to set up another dedicated sales force given the moves we have already made on that front. Kevin Lobo : Certainly for the lower extremities, foot and ankle, we may add a rep here or there, but we don't need a radical change. We have a really well organized footprint a couple of years ago when we decided to create a dedicated sales force calling on the podiatric surgeon, that we have the right numbers, more or less. Again we may add a few reps here or there to fill out certain areas, but I wouldn't expect anything significant from a sales force investment standpoint. This is just getting great products and plugging it right in to our existing sales force. Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein : Got it. Thanks. For my second question, I wanted to turn over to the MedSurg business and in particular, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the capital, the CapEx spending environment for the hospitals? We have seen, it looks like their bed business picked up a little bit, but maybe if you could just comment there on what your outlook is for the remainder of the year and what you are seeing in the marketplace. Thanks. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Derrick. I would tell you right now, that the capital environment still remains pretty stable. And by that, I mean it's still challenged as it relates some of the prioritization that our hospital customers do. And this is most relevant for our medical business which is 90% plus capital. We did report 3% growth. So it remains stable and we are pleased with the performance on a relative basis, but I wouldn't tell you we have seen any change in underlying capital demands on a high level as it relates to whether it's from ACA. That said, we are seeing very solid growth with our 1488 camera and have strong double-digit gains there and as well as System 7. So all capital is not the same, but as your comments are really towards the bigger tick at capital, I would say it's stable but no signs of an acceleration or increased investments by hospitals there. Operator : Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to the topic around orthopedic pricing. I think that J&J talked about this pretty explicitly within the U.S. business. Maybe you could just offer a little bit more perspective on, if there are any significant structural change you are seeing in the pricing environment? I think if you look at other MedTech markets, there were pretty good leading indicator to see when pricing was going to turn negative, like high levels of physician employment and vendor consolidation. But is anything that you are seeing really change in the market? And what would you be confidence? Is this sort of a one-off flip or something that could worsen from here? Katherine Owen : Yes. Thanks for the question, and you could imagine, we do a lot of analysis as we see how pricing trends are changing and it's clearly in the range of 1.5% to 2% but it's at the high-end and obviously if we think this is indicative of a fundamental change in the pricing environment, it's going to require us to think about things differently. So we really go into the next level of analysis and see the impact of the timing of product launches, expected product launches going forward and we feel very confident that what we are seeing is the normal quarter-to-quarter variation that occurs. We get price premium when we launch something like Accolade II, which had a very nice ramp up. But we have anniversaried that. So it would start to see the impact on pricing as a result of that. So all of that analysis that we do throughout the quarter, leads us to believe that this is consistent with the normal quarter-to-quarter variability that can exist. We tend to look over a rolling four quarters, because that gives you the best sense of the underlying trends but we don't think we have seen some fundamental change in the pricing environment that suggest we are going to see a significant step down in recon pricing. David Roman - Goldman Sachs : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow-up on the neurovascular business, which continues to do extremely well. Maybe you could just give us some update on end-market trends. I know back in March, there is that New England Journal of Medicine article that caused some disruption at your competitor, but you have powered right through that. So maybe if you could just give us sense in where end-market dynamics are right now and how we should think about that business on a go forward basis? Katherine Owen : Sure. If I focus on the neurovascular part, because that's clearly the biggest piece of the overall neurotech business. We continue to be really pleased. We participate in both the hemorrhagic and ischemic segment. Although hemorrhagic is really the revenue growth driver and it's really the target line that continues to-date additional share in each geographic region. We have added four line extensions since the original launch of the Target coil a few years back and that still is the bulk of the neurovascular market, upwards of 40% and we have absolutely taken meaningful market share year-over-year in the coil market. We are also launching into new geographies with the product lineup, whether it's the Target XL which is the larger size or the Target Nano, which we are introducing into the Japanese market. So it's really continuing to execute on that plan. The ischemic segment, it does take more investment to help develop that market and make sure you are getting patients to the right mode of care and it's really an emerging market, very much so, as it relates to the mechanical-based treatment of stroke segment. But we are very excited about the longer-term prospects. So we are going to continue with that playbook. I am just very pleased with the pace of product rollout and our ability to continue to launch them into new geographies. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I would just like to add. We have an absolutely outstanding management team in neurovascular and you have seen our R&D spending, as a company, has certainly ticked up. Part of the reason for that uptick is spending that we have done in neurovascular, which is clearly yielding benefits and we still have a robust pipeline beyond the products that Katherine alluded to that we had already launched. So we feel very, very bullish about this business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions on spine. First, you called out pricing pressure in your spinal segment. Can you tell us what that pricing pressure was and how that compares to the overall market, given your pricing was? Was the pricing more severe? And then second, strategically in spine do you feel like you have now all the technologies to be competitive with, for example, a J&J or Medtronic or is this a segment where we should anticipate more M&A? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So firstly on pricing. It's not a new trend. It's been a consistent trend where pricing is worse in the U.S. than it is globally, kind of down in the mid-single-digit range and globally, maybe low single-digit or more stable pricing. Our challenge in spine really is, that our position in MIS segments, and clearly the CoAlign acquisition was one step to help plug some of that gap. We were really well represented in broad-based in the scoliosis procedures, pedicle screws, the standard spinal fusion products. We are very well represented but in MIS areas, we have been launching a series of new products over the last 18 months. We have more products to come but those won't be launched before the end of this year. So it will have more of an impact in 2015. So I would continue to expect that either through internal innovation or through potential acquisitions that that's an area that we will be focused on, growing our presence in MIS portion of spine. And frankly, that's what caused us some of our challenges. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I will try to be brief. So Kevin, you guys have done a lot of acquisitions in the first half of the year. Just on the same M&A topic, should we expect you guys to be active in the second half as well? Katherine Owen : We would tell you that our BD activity ebbs and flows. There have been periods, if you go back a couple of years, where we did one transaction in the entire year despite having dedicated BD people in every one of our division. So it's impossible to time. We are focused on BD. We have it throughout the organization and we will probably have periods where a lot happens all at once, because that's just the nature of BD. But there is no change in the underlying strategy. M&A, for us, is the use of cash, dividends and buybacks. Kevin Lobo : You know that our organization, the way we are structured, is we have business development people in each of our division. So they are always scouring the market and constantly looking at targets. We are not stopping that activity. That doesn't predict that we will do a certain number of deals, but the ongoing activity doesn't stop. Whether a division is ready to absorb another one is obviously one of the factors that will be considered, but we have so many divisions within the company that we can take on multiple deals at one time. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Thank you, and then lastly, on the shoulder launch. Could you just give us an update on where you are with that? Thank you. Katherine Owen : We launched the reverse shoulder during Q2 and really going into Q3 as we start to get it out there. It's a different market than the other extremity areas, foot and ankle, for example, that is very much a market expansion segment. So we are seeing growth as we gain share, but also just the overall expansion of that market. That's not the case for shoulder. You have got more established players there and a much lower underlying growth, but it was a key gap in our portfolio. It was very difficult to go in without having the full product offering that a surgeon may need and you have only got one option for them. So we are excited about the ability to introduce that product to our hybrid reconstructive sales force, but I would have more tempered expectations, just given the nature of the market and the establishment of existing players. Kevin Lobo : And really in the second quarter, it was more on a limited launch basis, with a certain set of surgeons. The full launch will really occur sometime by the end of the third quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from William Blair. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien - William Blair : Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, I was just looking across your portfolio, it seems like you have a pretty well-rounded product offering across recon, MedSurg and elsewhere. I am just curious about your thoughts on the need in areas where you are already participating to get a lot bigger versus just continuing to internally invest in those areas and organically growing and if you have ever seen a situation where one of your bigger competitors, like a J&J, just given their larger say, in trauma, has been able to cloud you across you out because of their size, rather than just their product offering? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think the only example of trauma that you highlight is actually good example because their size and strength would simply certainly isn't slowing us down and our ability to grow. If you look at our growth over the last eight quarters, being number two hasn't really been a problem for us. We are growing at a very robust rate. So the key is you want to be one of the leaders in a segment and we like to be very strong in orthopedics and it narrows service line of hospitals, especially in surgery. We want to make sure we have very strong position or a path to be in a strong position. So you know our portfolio, you know within some of our portfolio, we don't have a number one or two position, and in those areas you can imagine that we are going to want to get to that kind of position over a period of time, whether it is through internal innovation. Trauma is a story of around internal innovation, largely, but one small acquisition of Memometal for the most part internally, we pulled away from the pack five years ago. Synthes was the dominant number one and then everybody else was tied for two, and we completely pulled away from the pack and we did that internally. Sometimes we will have to do it through acquisitions, and we are not going to disclose which of the approaches we will use in those segments where we are lower but for the most part, most of our portfolio, we feel that we are punching at our weight and we are really in a strong position to compete. In the case of hips and knees, we obviously felt that robotics was going to be a really key lever for us to drive above market growth. That may be different in other spaces where we might choose to do an acquisition just to increase our scale. But we have very few areas where we are really at a distant gap from the leaders and in those segments you can imagine that we will be active. Matthew O'Brien - William Blair : Okay. Thank you and then just one more on the spine side of things. You mentioned a pretty competitive environment as far some of your sales force disruptions go. Is that a function of some of these guarantees getting to be fairly high levels? And is that coming from some of the really small providers out there or some the bigger multinational multiproduct companies? Kevin Lobo : I would say absolutely, you are right on with the guarantees. That's the big reason that we are having some sales force departures, are very large guarantees, and frankly it's coming from multiple players. So it's not just smaller spine only. It's even some of the other players. So that hit us in towards the middle to end of the first quarter and that had more of an impact in the second quarter. It's a tough market. It's not a new tough market. It has been a tough market for a long time. It will continue to be a tough market and we are just to make sure that we stay focused. We made some adds to our leadership team that I feel really positive about and I think will be in good shape going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have been making pretty good progress on reducing SG&A and I was just wondering to what extent you feel that this level of reduction is sustainable given all the initiatives underway and if the European headquarters will also have an impact on any sort of SG&A spending there? And then separately, you mentioned giving back some of the incremental offsets on the taxes. Where exactly are those investments going to go? Are those internal or through acquisitions? Kevin Lobo : So I would say, a couple things. As you look toward the back half of this year, we still feel very good about what type of improvements that you should see from an SG&A perspective year-over-year. So you should continue to see nice improvements there. And I think that from an overall perspective, especially if we can continue to drive above market growth, which we are doing on a number of different product related categories, that obviously helps us to continue to leverage that space and I think you should expect that as we are moving forward. From an overall perspective on the tax comment that we made, I think it's more of an awareness that one, we are expecting some nice improvements from the tax rate side of the equation and our expectation is that we are going to be spending some of that as we move forward but I think that's more of wait and see related response based on how well the business is doing and what type of areas that we think that would like to invest in and I think you will get more color on that as we move through the back half of this year. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And with respect to tax, should we look at this as just the start of what could be additional reduction beyond 2015? Or is this one step function and that's basically it? Kevin Lobo : Well, I would say, that we have made very good progress in the tax area to begin with. This project is just another big step associated with that and the improvements that we are expecting to get over the next couple of years, we are obviously still driving to maximize that level and it will take us kind of a couple of years to truly get the full benefit associated with even the projects that we are currently working on. Moving forward, beyond that, obviously while our efforts will be strong in that area, there is also many, many pressures around the world through a number of different jurisdictions and trying to increase different tax revenue in different areas. So that's a challenging environment, but I think that we are well positioned and I think we still have a lot of good opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird : Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevin, I was wondering on the extremities market, your comment of 10% to 15% market growth. I was wondering if you could maybe go even a little deeper in the weeds there on the ankle replacement market? Maybe how you see the ankle replacement market itself growing in the U.S. and Europe? And then on your comments on STAR, on that ankle product. We have been hearing about maybe some early revisions with that product, a decline in utilization because of that in some markets. Obviously you see a lot more of that business than the few anecdotal conversations we had. So maybe you could set me straight on some of the things we have been hearing out on the field on that product? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So first thing I would say is, if you look at the total joint replacement in general, the ankle is one of the late bloomers. So you have knees and hips and shoulders and it took time before it really started to get traction before the growth really kicked in and a lot of people predicted the total ankle would take a much, much larger percentage of the procedures which today, as you know, is mostly fusion. People predicted that five, six, seven years ago. We now really see the market starting to be primed for a take off. Now predicting these take offs, as we have proven with our own foot and ankle, those other products, is not easy to predict when it will take off and what pace of take off. But we really believe that this is like the early stages of hips and knees. That's kind of what's been happening in the total ankle market. We believe the market is really primed to start to improve. This is the most published ankle on the market. It has tremendous data. So the anecdotes, as you hear a lot of the anecdotes at least from our point of view, it really relates to the sales force execution and the service and we really believe we are getting a fantastic product out there. It's the most published by far. The data is long-term in nature and very, very solid. You always hear anecdotes about different products. A lot of times, our competitors are the ones that will throw those anecdotes around and so we are not worried about it. We have done our due diligence. Believe me, we have known we have a gap in total ankle for some time and we have been very deliberative about making sure we make the right choice. We believe we made the right choice and having a cementless PMA approved total ankle, we believe, is a real competitive advantage and now putting it in our sales force's hands will change the story in terms of the growth trajectory that's currently being pursued in the market. Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird : Yes, understood. Thank you. And then, Katherine, maybe for my follow-up. I just wanted to be clear on what you are saying on MAKO and your implants. You are saying jus the Stryker hip itself by 2015, I think is what you are saying, and I think that's a little bit of a change in the path. I think you have been little coy on whether it would be Stryker implant or the Restoration implant, what might get approved, not approved on MAKO. Can you just set me straight on Stryker implant, hip, knee, timing of expectations on that again? Katherine Owen : Yes, you correct. It's incremental information. We really tried to say that as we get better clarity, we will share information with you. So at this point, we do feel comfortable that we will be launching, Stryker hip on the MAKO system in 2015. We will probably get into more specifics at the Analyst Meeting, and regarding specific hip systems. The knee system, there is no change. The trial is underway. We continue to expect to launch a total knee on the MAKO in 2015. We haven't got any more specific on the timing of that yet. The trial is being done with the pipeline knee that was MAKO's knee system. We do believe there is a regulatory path that may not require a completely new trial to bring our own knee systems on to the MAKO robot in 2015. But I would say, the probability of that is less than pipeline which is the knee being used in the trial. So new information on hips, more details to come in September and no change to our thinking on knees. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor - Barclays: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two more strategic questions. So I guess the first one is, you made some comments over the past few months over the benefits of scale but maybe not scope yet. And I was just curious, over the past couple of years, you have made a lot of acquisitions to diversify away from recon. How do you view the benefits of scale in recon and how do think that the Zimmer. Biomet deal could impact your business positively or negatively, if it does close? Kevin Lobo : So the characterization that we did a lot of acquisitions to diversify away from recon, certainly since I have been the CEO, it's really about strengthening our businesses. Strengthening our businesses within orthopedics, within neuro and within specialty surgery. And I am really agnostic about how we strengthen those businesses. So MAKO is a deal that's absolutely within reconstructive. Trauson is a deal that's a orthopedic deal. Then we have done deals that are outside in endoscopy and in another division. So I would say, certainly I wouldn't want anybody to think that our focus on acquisitions is to diversify away from. It's really to strengthen all of our existing businesses. Certainly, this consolidation within recon is something that we have been anticipating. It's not a big surprise, the Zimmer, Biomet, that that would happen. Having five competitors in a market that's not growing close to double digits normally would lead to some form of consolidation. So it's not totally surprising. The market has been pretty well disciplined thus far and we expect that that will add extra discipline to that. And I think that's about all that I would say on that. Matt Taylor - Barclays: Thanks, and then just a follow-up. Your earlier comments on China, I thought were interesting and you have kind of a tiered structure there and some strong presence in both the premium and value segment. I guess I am just curious as you look out over the next couple of years, how are you going to continue to grow and defend your share? Are you concerned about emerging market players or your \"generic orthopedic devices\" or is that too small to be concerned with at this point? Kevin Lobo : Yes. We feel really excited about the prospects within China, because certainly regardless of what happens with China's overall GDP, the healthcare market in China will be very healthy for the future and there's significant growth to be had both within the premium segment as well as in the value segment. Local players will continue to pop up in the lower-priced segment, but to have a well-rounded and very, very diverse product bag is critical. A lot of the business happens through tenders and to be able to win the tender, you need a strong brand, a strong local brand, which we have with Trauson, that has very, very broad product portfolio and registration times are not easy. The reason we moved towards acquisition was, we could have done it ourselves, it would have taken us six or seven years and we probably wouldn't have had products at lower price with the kind of heritage that we were able to get through the acquisition. So we really believe it has a long runway in front of us. Ramesh Subrahmanian, our Group President for International is going to do a deep dive on China at the Analyst Day Meeting and really our biggest opportunity, certainly in the next couple of years beyond China is taking Trauson to other countries which we are starting to do this year and which we will share more in the future, but there is markets like India that have big trauma markets where we don't even play in today. We are planning to launch into Trauson in 2015 in India and many other emerging markets where we have trauma markets where Stryker has not historically played. To us, that's a very, very significant growth potential for the long-term. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Mike Matson - Needham & Company: Thanks. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the commission rate changes that you made in the recon business? I guess I am wondering, number one, was that limited to just recon or have you gone through similar moves in some of your other businesses? And then number two, how big of an impact has that had in the SG&A levers that we have seen this year? And is this something that you can continue to ratchet down in future years? Katherine Owen : Yes, I would say, we did the commission rate cut for our recon sales forces in the U.S. at the start of the first quarter. We intend to do rate adjustment every few years. So it would have been three, four years since the last time. We recognize that we were above markets. So we moved in more line with the market and structured it to have a greater focus on growth. And that was one of the factors that we talked about the first quarter call that led to some of the softness on the recon business. It's clearly part of what's helping to drive the SG&A leverage. It's not all of it, but it's clearly a component of it. The rest of our businesses, MedSurg's does commission rate adjustments as well. They tend to do it more on an incremental basis, more frequently. Each of the businesses have their own approach to it. And there has been really no change that in fact was felt in some of the disruption around. It really was a first quarter effect. Mike Matson - Needham & Company: Okay, and then just on the hedging program. Will that be fully in place by 2015? In other words, when we get into 2015, will these be pretty significant or potentially significant currency impacts on your gross margin be over effectively? Kevin Lobo : Well, they are obviously never over because the exchange rates are always moving, right. So the hedging program is really just meant to mitigate that risk. It just buffers the impact with between quarters and try to smooth those increases, all right. It doesn't avoid the increases. So as those increases change over time, obviously that's an impact that occurs over time. Should you at least eliminate the peaks and the valleys associated with those movements, absolutely. The full program will probably be in place by probably mid-year, next year where we have got full six layer hedges consistently in place moving forward from that point. Operator : The last question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Kevin, can you talk maybe just about how you envision MAKO potentially creating advantages for Stryker's recon sales organization through efficiency or enhanced flexibility either in the OR or outside of the OR? Kevin Lobo : Well, I will go back to all of the comments we have made around the rationale for doing the deal is you deliver a delightful experience for the surgeon. The surgeon is able to produce consistent placement of the implant intraoperative adjustments and once they have that experience and we believe again the total knee will be the most promising. Certainly a bicruciate sparing knees becomes a big part of the market. We believe robotics will play beautifully into that. But it will be one of those situations, just like what happened with in the Uni market, where MAKO was able to take almost 20% share within a four year period. Once a surgeon does it robotically and has a delightful experience, they are not going back. So we will be the only game in town. So for us, it's a very differentiated approach that provides a meaningful benefit. A lot of those benefits, we believe, over time we are going to have to prove it with certain clinical trials, which we will be doing, but a lot of it's intuitive and obvious. It makes this procedure easier to do. It makes it more consistent. It makes it more reproducible and certainly once we put the Stryker implants with the robot, we have done a lot of research before we did the acquisition and surgeons were very interest in robotics. If you look at our manufacturing plants, you walk through Stryker's manufacturing plants, you see robots everywhere. And why is that? Well, robots can produce cleaner, more consistent results. It's just undeniable. And therefore we really believe bringing this to surgery is a logical extension and MAKO proved it already once with the Uni and we are going to now have to prove it in other procedures. And we feel very optimistic about being able to do so. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners : So maybe just my second question to follow-up on the first one. I was talking a little bit more just about the selling model, so to speak, or does it provide you with increased flexibility to drive efficiency through your sales organization itself, the way they itself interact with the physician, et cetera? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So, the way it works for robotic procedures, is you have a technician that helps operate the robot and that technician is not a regular commissioned sales person. So they are paid at a much different price point than our typical commissioned salesperson. And once the surgeon is converted and actually does their procedures robotically, you don't really need that commissioned sales force person to be there all the time. They can go off and cover additional surgeons and go cover additional hospitals. So over time, with the adoption of robotics, if it grows in the trend line that we expect, you would assume that the average cost of people that are in the field will go down over time. It doesn't mean we are paying our reps less. Our reps will still be paid as high powered reps that are gaining business, but the actual people who are technically there to help manage the case are paid at a much lower rate. And today there is one price model. The rep, whether it's a rep servicing an accounts or whether they are selling, they are paid the same today. With robotics, we are going to enable a bit of a bifurcation of the model to case coverage people who are technicians, who are paid at a lower rate and sales force who are paid for selling at a higher rate. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners : And does that lead to a bifurcation of the implant from the service cost eventually in your view? Kevin Lobo : Well, as I said before, you are going to have two different kinds of people. You are going to have this commission sales force for selling and paid at a high price and the technicians who are a lower price, but there be less need if we gain tremendous volume, there will be less need for high-priced commission reps to just service accounts. They will be out selling. So I really believe that will give us better productivity with our commercial resources. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. As you know it took a little longer this call and really part of the reason for that was to provide extra color on the acquisitions. We have been very busy on the acquisition front and we plan to provide additional perspectives on acquisitions every quarter. So thank you all for joining the call. Our conference call for the third quarter of 2014 results will be held on October 16. Thank you Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Baird Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann David Roman - Goldman Sachs Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets Matt Taylor - Barclays Operator : Welcome to Stryker's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release, that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly reports, before turning it to Q&A. Our top line performance strengthened in Q3, with organic revenue growth of 8%, which did include the benefit from one extra selling day, that contributed roughly 1%. These results reflect solid year-over-year growth for all three business segments; Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine, while also being balanced geographically. Within Reconstructive, trauma and extremities continued its lengthy string of double digit increases and U.S. hip implants were also a standout. MedSurg's impressive gains in instruments were bolstered by acceleration in Neptune sales, and in medical we are seeing early signs of a strengthening in the CapEx environment. Our Neurotechnology and Spine Group reported double digit growth in the neuro businesses, partly offset by lower growth in spinal implants. From a geographic perspective, both the U.S. and international delivered high single digit year-over-year organic growth. Europe continues to gain traction, and our strong performance in emerging markets reinforces our view of this segment's long term potential to contribute meaningfully to our growth goals. Overall, the strength of our diverse revenue base, enabled us to offset some challenges and achieve impressive growth. As Katherine will discuss, we are working to drive greater momentum with MAKO, and while sales are pacing below our target, the pipeline development is encouraging as is our clinical progress. Gross margin was similar to Q2, as we are seeing the impact of a modestly tougher pricing environment, coupled with the negative effect of mix with existing products and acquisitions. Shifting to SG&A, our focus on reducing costs is evident, as we continue to drive this down as a percent of sales. We realize additional P&L leverage, as the benefits from our recently opened European Regional Headquarters contributed to a lower tax rate. With the strong pipeline, reduction in operating expenses and the lower tax rate, offset by meaningful investments in R&D, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.15 a share, up 10.6% year-over-year. For the full year, we are confident in our ability to achieve organic sales growth of 5% to 6%. We expect adjusted EPS to come in at the low end of our $4.75 to $4.80 range, owing to the tougher foreign exchange environment that Bill will elaborate on. Also, the creation of our European Headquarters will enable us to repatriate approximately $2 billion of O-U.S. cash over the course of 2015. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on the performance of our recent key acquisitions. Encouragingly, the acquisitions of Trauson, Berchtold and Patient Safety Technology, which we reviewed in detail on our Q2 call, all continue to track with our expectations, while Pivot is running slightly ahead, as we leverage the strength of our considerable endoscopy sales channel. Shifting to MAKO, overall we are encouraged by the progress we are making, while recognizing some challenges. Our capital sales are pacing behind our initial targets, but we have made progress each quarter, with a total of eight robots sold in Q3. We are confident that the market for robots is improving, as we have a strong pipeline of deals we are working on closing. We expect continued sequential improvement in Q4 and into next year for several reasons. Firstly, we are in the final stages of the integration of the MAKO selling organization into our recon sales force, and the development of sales coordination between the MAKO capital sales reps and our very large recon implant sales force. The first stage was completed in April, as we move the MAKO selling and service organization into our recon division and under recon management and establish near term incentives. We continue to work toward full integration into a single implant and selling organization. Gaining near term sale synergies has proven to be more challenging than we anticipated, but we are encouraged by the recent momentum. Secondly, we have developed and are expanding our flexible financing offering that we believe a number of hospitals will find attractive, as we look to leverage our considerable expertise in this area. On the clinical front, we have completed enrolment in our total knee trial and continue to target FDA approval in 2015. Turning to SBI, we are very pleased with the early integration, with sales tracking ahead of our initial expectations. We have trained over 100 Stryker reps on the STAR ankle and various products. By the time the training is complete, we will have over 200 reps trained and selling the STAR Ankle and over 400 reps trained in selling SBI's various upper extremity products. Its important to note that the STAR Ankle is a fourth generation design with over 28,000 total ankles implanted globally. There are now well over 100 clinical studies on the STAR Ankle, with one of the newest published by Dr. Michael Kaufman [ph], where he reported 94% survivorship at an average of 12.6 years. We believe these favorable long term results are helping to differentiate the STAR Ankle from our competitors, and reinforce the benefits of three-piece mobile bearing technology. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Jellison : Thanks Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 11.1% in the third quarter, including a negative 0.2% impact from foreign exchange translation. Constant currency sales increased 11.3%, which includes organic growth of 7.8%. We had a positive impact from one more selling day in the quarter, which had a positive impact on growth of approximately 1%. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter were $0.16 per share versus $0.27 per share last year, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.15 for the quarter versus $1.04 last year. This quarter's earning per share includes a negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from foreign exchange due to currency movements later in the quarter. If foreign exchange rates stay on current levels, this year will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 compared to last year, or approximately $0.04 per share worse than what we anticipated at the end of the second quarter. Based on the current volatility of foreign exchange rates, we would expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by roughly $0.10 to $0.12 per share. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being mostly offset by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. The most significant non-GAAP adjustment in the quarter relates to tax expense, associated with both the transfer of intellectual property to the Netherlands from some of our other European locations and for planned tax payments associated with approximately $2 billion of cash repatriation associated with this transfer. I will discuss both of these items a little more, when I discuss our tax rate. Also in the quarter, we incurred a charge of approximately $25 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. These charges may increase or decrease over time, as additional facts become available and assumptions more refined. As mentioned in the past, no insurance proceeds, that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included. Looking at sales in the third quarter, our organic growth rate of 7.8% was comprised of a positive 10.2% from volume and mix, the highest quarterly growth level since 2008, while price negatively impacted sales by 2.3%. Acquisitions added 3.4% while FX had a negative 0.2% on sales in the quarter. Looking at our segments, Reconstructive represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 8.5% as reported and grew 8.6% constant currency and increased 4.9% organically. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 11.9% in the quarter, Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 15.3% and grew 7.1% internationally, with 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business, excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have a great success in expanding the market. U.S. hips and knees growth in the period was 8.1% and 6.8% and O-U.S. sales were down nearly a percentage point in hips against a 9% comp last year in the quarter, but up 5.3% in knees on a constant currency basis. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 16.3% on an as-reported basis, 16.6% on a constant currency basis, and increased 11.9% organically. These results benefited from the high teen growth in our instruments business, as we continue to quickly regain share, post the late 2013 relaunch of Neptune. However, even excluding Neptune, instruments grew double digits in the quarter. We also had upper teens growth in our endoscopy, driven by recent acquisitions. Medical had a strong quarter with double digit organic growth, as the hospital capital equipment market began picking up. Sustainability Solutions returned to positive growth in the quarter two. International sales within MedSurg were also up nearly 20% in the quarter and were up slightly over 20% in constant currency, benefiting mostly from double digit organic growth in each of the instruments, endoscopy, and medical categories. The MedSurg Group should continue to see strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, as Neptune has another quarter of easier comps. Although you should note, there will be one less selling day in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine which represents 18% of our sales increased 6.5% as reported, 6.9% on a constant currency basis and 6.5% organically. Growth in the segment was led by double digit growth in Neurotechnology businesses and IVS grew high single digit in constant currency, while spinal implant sales increased in the low single digit range. In looking at our operational performance, gross margin on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2014 were nearly flat sequentially at 66%. This compares to 68.8% in the same period last year. The primary decline in the margin rate in the quarter resulted from both negative product mix and negative price pressures. Our mix was especially negative in this quarter, due to the impact of recent acquisitions and strong sales of our MedSurg products which grew over 16% in the quarter. These products have a lower gross margin rate than the company average. Pricing was down 2.3% in the quarter or 30 basis points sequentially. U.S. hips and knee pricing wireless stable versus Q2, wit the decline attributed to spine and trauma products. Pricing pressure remains challenging and is expected to be down approximately 2% for the company moving forward. Margins were also negatively impacted from foreign exchange movements compared to last year. Note that we anticipate our margin rate in the fourth quarter to be near the rates we experienced in the fourth quarter last year, which are also more consistent with our current year-to-date gross margin performance. Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales, slightly higher than last year in the quarter, this is a 12.5% increase in R&D spending over last year, primarily reflecting a higher level of R&D spending tied to recent acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $851 million or 35.6% of sales in the quarter versus 38% in the prior year period, as we delivered strong sales growth and were able to continue to leverage our overhead and gain traction on driving greater operational efficiencies. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.9% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to 24.4% in the third quarter of 2013. The rate was negatively impacted by lower pricing, acquisition and product mix and foreign exchange rates in the quarter, partially offset by operational improvements and lower selling, general and admin expenses as a percent of sales. Other expenses on an adjusted basis in the third quarter were approximately $25 million compared to $13 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense and these expenses are expected to run at a similar level throughout the rest of the years. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 86.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.9%. This compares to a 22.4% adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter last year. We expect the full year rate will be approximately 22% consistent with our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate. Please note that the renewal of the tax extenders is still reflected in our year and earnings forecast, which if approved, will help reduce the fourth quarter tax rate. However if not approved and made effective this year, it will negatively impact our earnings guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter by approximately $0.05 per share. As we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam. During the third quarter, we transferred intellectual property from other countries within Europe to the Netherlands and also made decisions to repatriate nearly $2 billion from Europe to the U.S. over the next year. Most of these funds will be transferred to the U.S. in the back half of 2015. These actions triggered a tax expense, which we booked in the third quarter of this year. The cash outflows for payment of this tax will occur between the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2015. The transfer of the intellectual property provides us more flexibility in managing our operations in the future and aligns the ownership with where our primary European leadership team will be located. This project will also generate some ongoing tax benefits, which as we mentioned previously, are expected to further reduce our overall adjusted operating tax rate in 2015 by approximately two full percentage points. Currently, we are expecting to reinvest approximately half of these savings directly into our business. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the third quarter at 56 or one day better than the end of the third quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 182 days, which was a three day reduction compared to 185 days in the third quarter last year. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first nine months of 2014 were $1.1 billion, relatively the same as the first nine months of last year. Capital expenditures were $172 million in the first nine months of the year, compared to $139 million in the same period last year. We still have over $500 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as approximately $100 million of share repurchases were made year-to-date. As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 sales guidance includes organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6%, and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. Due to recent FX pressures, we are more comfortable at the low end of that range. Also as mentioned previously, the renewal of the tax extenders remains in our guidance. However, if these are not renewed, it would have a negative impact on our current year guidance of approximately $0.05 per share. Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to talk about really two items. One was the MedSurg performance this morning. I was hoping you could discuss the environment and how you think it evolved in the quarter, both the U.S. and in Europe. And then second Bill, it looks like the gross margin came in lighter than you were baking, maybe a month ago, and I assume part of that is mix, maybe part of it is FX, I was hoping you could tease that out for us a little bit. Thanks. Katherine Owen : Mike, I will take the first part, in terms of the MedSurg performance, and I am overall, really pleased with what we saw in the quarter. I would say for the higher ticket capital products that are predominantly in our medical business, although to a lesser degree, in endo, we are seeing signs of strengthening. How strong that ends up being tough to tell, because this is really the first quarter where we feel comfortable commenting that it feels that the CapEx environment has strengthened. Instruments is really hitting on all cylinders. Clearly, the Neptune relaunch continues to gain traction. But as mentioned, even excluding that, we had solid double digit growth. So its really across the board. Endo really benefited from the acquisition, as we mentioned before, they had challenging year-over-year comparisons. So I think overall, we feel good about the environment, and feel like there has been very strong momentum going into the fourth quarter, which as you know, is typically -- a particularly strong quarter as it relates to CapEx. Bill Jellison : Mike, then on the gross margin rate, as far as our expectation. Actually the margin rates for the quarter came in relatively close to what we were expecting. We were expecting, as I mentioned before that this was going to be our toughest gross margin comp quarter. I'd say that pricing was incrementally a little bit worse than what we expected, so it did have a little bit of additional impact on the rate, but not much in relationship to what we were expecting. We expect it to be relatively close to the rates that we ran at in the second quarter, and as I mentioned, that's pretty consistent with our expectations moving into the fourth quarter this year and as I also mentioned, that should be more in line with kind of the rates that we were running last year in the fourth quarter as well. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: Okay. If I can just ask one follow-up. So Bill, at the analyst meeting, you made some comments just relative to the ability to drive operating leverage in 2015. Can you just, with this quarter now behind you and you have kind of seen what the gross margin progression looks like, is that -- are you still confident in your ability to drive operating leverage next year? Bill Jellison : I think our broader based comments, first just talking about rate improvements in future periods. We generally talk about that over the next few years, but we are absolutely focused on targeting improvements in operating margin rates, not gross margin rates, but operating margin rates on average over time. we did state though however for next year that because of our investments with some of the tax benefits that half of those tax benefits would be actually reinvested directly in our business, and that will also obviously add pressure associated with the rate in that period. Kevin Lobo : So Mike, its Kevin, just to add. So obviously we will give guidance in January, and you should expect to see leveraged earnings. We obviously don't spike out the guidance specifically in every line of our P&L. The last two years on an operational basis, we were able to have gross margin gains over the last couple of years. Clearly, our mix of our business has changed, based on both our acquisitions as well as MedSurg growing, but we do have our GQ&O efforts clearly focused on driving improvement in our comps. But with price now tracking more towards a 2% range, its certainly an area of extreme focus for us. But you will see, when we give our guidance in January, the degree of leverage that we will be delivering in 2015. Operator : And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Good afternoon. First question, Katherine, just based on some of your comments on MAKO. Just a few things I was wondering you could elaborate on; one was, you talked about sales synergies being a little more challenging than you expected, and then also new financing options for customers, and I guess in light of the CapEx improvement, very curious in terms of what does that mean? Are you experimenting with sort of lease type models, reagent rental type models, so those two dynamic sales and financing options for customers regarding MAKO and then I have one follow-up? Katherine Owen : Okay. So to take the second part, we have offered through our Flex Financial Group financing options, because of the capital components that exists within many of our MedSurg businesses. So we have been in that financing area for a number of years. What we are doing, is expanding that and leveraging that expertise over to the recon side, where the MAKO capital fits, and really helping them work with some of the budget limitations that exists between capital and operating budgets within a hospital. So a variety of different options that we are looking at, but its clearly a skill we have, and something that MAKO couldn't, at their point in their trajectory offer to customers. In terms of the integration, I think the most challenging part, and I think its fair to say, we underestimated the complexity of it, but feel very comfortable with the trajectory we are on. Its just integrating a capital salesforce alongside a very large implant salesforce, and going through the necessary training and coordination that has to take place in existing accounts. So its nothing truly unique, its just, it\u2019s a big job to do, given how large our salesforce is. So we are making really good headway, very excited about the pipeline we are seeing and our ability to continue to drive sequential acceleration in robot sales. David Lewis - Morgan Stanley : Okay. That's very helpful. And then Bill, just a question on the balance sheet; obviously with their [indiscernible] event, your balance sheet is going to expand in size here over the next six months. And Stryker is in this interesting position right now, where you basically are the most underlevered company in all large cap med-tech and there is an increasing trend largely to M&A increase that relative rate of leverage. But I am just sort of wondering, given that increase in cash over the short term, which is going to be quite rapid, can you think about the spread between your cash interest and what you can get in the credit markets, that spread is actually pretty narrow. So you start thinking about different level of capital structure that's appropriate for Stryker, given your cash balance is going to expand here rapidly in the next six months? Bill Jellison : Well I think its fair to say that we definitely believe that our balance sheet is very strong across the board and has been. And so we always want to make sure that we are putting the broader based assets that we have to work as efficiently and effectively as we can. I think as Kevin mentioned multiple times, we are absolutely first and foremost focused on acquisitions, but dividends and stock buybacks are also a key part of our overall cash structure strategy. Just keep in mind as well too, that as we move forward here, we have been booking and accruing an amount on our Rejuvenate claims, at some point, those will potentially be paid out. So we have to make sure that we are covered for that situation. But also on the cash repatriation side, also keep in mind that as I mentioned, most of that cash won't occur actually until the back half of 2015. But you can be assured that we are actively looking at how to best utilize that cash moving forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Hi, congrats. Hear me okay? Katherine Owen : Yeah, hi Kristen. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay perfect. Thanks. Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask a question just kind of, if you can give us your broad I guess view on just the overall recon market, and in particular, your performances in Europe or within international markets seems to be improving nicely. Maybe just walk us through I guess, what you are seeing if you're seeing underlying improvement, if you would expect to continue to see improvements going forward sequentially, seasonality, and I think you do have a, one last selling day in the fourth quarter as well, I just wanted to confirm that? Katherine Owen : Yeah. We do have one last selling day in the fourth quarter, and I would say that, it\u2019s a little bit geographic dependent, but clearly the momentum we are seeing in Europe continues, and that's helping that O-U.S. growth, recognizing as we mentioned, we did have some very difficult comps, particularly on the hip side. Japan, with the price cuts have been challenging and also, we have been working through, and largely are past that now, but there were implications tied to the ERP implementation that we talked about previously. But overall, feel pretty good about the environment. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then on the U.S. side, any comments there, in particular? Katherine Owen : Yeah I mean, a little tough, because obviously we don't have all the numbers in yet, but in terms of hips, we feel pretty comfortable that we are growing ahead of the market, even after adjusting for MAKO. These for the past eight quarters, we have kept pace with the market. We may be a little trailing in that this quarter, but we will have to wait and see as everybody else's numbers come in. It does seem like overall, this is a year where the hip market is stronger than the knee market. Seasonality, I think you're going to see a similar dynamic recognizing that was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter last year, so its really difficult to predict if we are going to have that healthy of a seasonality effect. But clearly, Q4 is going to see the benefit of that seasonality. Operator : And our next question comes from David Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. David Turkaly - JMP Securities : Thanks. Just quickly, I think you said that U.S., the knee pricing was stable. Did you guys quantify that in terms of a percent, the pricing impact on those two lines? Katherine Owen : No. What we said was, in the U.S., hip and knee pricing was consistent with what we saw in the second quarter of this year's -- approximately in that mid single digit range. David Turkaly - JMP Securities : So mid single digit range for both? Katherine Owen : Yes. David Turkaly - JMP Securities : And I guess, given the better CapEx environment you guys talked about, I am curious if you guys have any comment on sort of utilization or overall procedural volume or sort of surgeon backlog here. Any thoughts or any updated thoughts on that, post this quarter? Katherine Owen : No. I don't think we have any real insights to offer there. It does seem like the CapEx environment did modestly improve. But again its one quarter, and its tough to know, if that is a trend that's going to be indicative of accelerating unit volume. So overall, feel good about the momentum we are seeing, but we don't really have any insight, as it relates to physician volumes or [indiscernible] and the like. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Hi. Just following to hospital capitals, one follow-up there on strength. You talked about it potentially improving here towards the end of a seasonally strong fourth quarter. You mentioned last year I think Kevin, you had spoken quite a bit about this sort of collaborative approach across to this line, but they are sort of customized flexible financing approach, this contracting with hospitals, based on capital or operating pricing; [indiscernible] capital business lines; what you're seeing in your estimation seasonal and sort of market improvements or to what degree do you think you're taking share because of some of the programs you've put in place? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Okay Matt, first of all for the follow-up, if you are on speaker, I'd appreciate if you could just get off the speaker, because we had a little trouble hearing you. But I think I got the gist of the question, and so clearly, we do have a lot of flexible programs, we are collaborating across our divisions. But I would say at this stage of that work, its really more about our teams executing directly with our customers, and we clearly saw a nice performance in medical last quarter, and the second quarter, and that also accelerated very dramatically in the third quarter. So part of it is, the market is improving. We can see conditions in the market improving, and part of it is our execution. Really difficult for me to parse, which one of those two, and when more people report this quarter, we will have a better sense on how much of it is growing with the market, versus how much is taking shares. My sense is, we are probably growing a little faster, but I can't dimensionalize that for you just yet. I would say, our collaboration efforts, its still early, we were getting some wins, but I wouldn't attribute the bulk of our success to that. Its really more about our -- our team is really performing well in the market. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Thanks for that. The follow-up maybe for Katherine on MAKO. You had mentioned adjusting for hips, and we certainly have heard more interest on the hip side. As you complete this integration and head into the end of the year, is there something that you can give us that we might view as sort of capital as heading into next year. And to what degree is the hip emerging as sort of an important application whereas maybe a year or two ago, kind of view it as sort of maybe a less interesting opportunity than the knee side? Katherine Owen : So thanks. I think there is a couple of things. I would go back to all the products we highlighted, the Stryker products that we are going to be putting on the robot, targeting for 2015. On the hip side, where they obviously have an indication, and we would agree, we are seeing increasing interest there, and then clearly, our expectation to get approval with triathlon on the robot in 2015. So those are probably the two major triggers. Now keep in mind, we are going to have to do training and software upgrades and there is going to be work to be done and make sure this launch is executed in such a way that we can achieve our goals, and that's why we continue to point to -- think about 2016 as the year when we are really going to be on a trajectory where its indicative of us taking meaningful market share gains. Kevin Lobo : What I would add is, Matt, just to add one comment. The hip application, we were certainly excited about it, the software improvements and the last version that was done just prior to our acquisition, and made a big improvement. But surgeons for the most part are pretty happy with our hips, so this requires really a change management with surgeons, to really get to try it and have a good experience and having our implants of course that will help dramatically with that. But we still see the total knee as a much bigger opportunity. There is less overall satisfaction with patients and the perception of improvement we think is far greater than total knee. So there is certainly going to be growth in both areas, but the knee still for us is the biggest opportunity. Operator : And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies: Hi. Good afternoon. I wondered if I could just ask on the pricing environment in the United States. One of your competitors earlier this week talked about worsening pricing, particularly on the hip side, and you are talking about a much more stable environment, and just curious if you have any thoughts around why we would be seeing this dichotomy or this diversion in pricing in the market? Kevin Lobo : I think we are actually experiencing some very similar pricing phenomenon, and so the characterization is last year versus this year, or how things are going from quarter-to-quarter this year. So certainly versus the prior year, we are seeing a moderate acceleration in price pressure, or prices have certainly declined. When we characterize it as stable, its really over the course of this year. But when you compare the prior year, certainly, we are seeing an acceleration, and that's why we are now modeling for total company price decrease of roughly 2%. Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray : Okay, that's helpful. Maybe I could ask one about MAKO as well. I think as you outlined at the analyst meeting, I mean, one of the interesting things about that now for you, is that you seem to broaden the offering in a sense to -- for hospitals in terms of not only offering better potential patient outcomes, but also looking at things like efficiency and infections and other sorts of benefits you might be able to get from the robot? And I guess the question is when we might start to see some of that data, so that you can present the much more compelling case to the hospitals to adopt it? Katherine Owen : I would say that we are obviously continuing to analyze and look at data. I wouldn't point you to anything near term on the data front. I think this is really going to be getting this in the hands of Stryker and other physicians, leveraging the breadth of our product offering and then seeing, just as they did with [indiscernible] the benefits of having the consistency of results, reproducability, better patient experience, all those things that they will get a feel for, as they start to use the robot. I think long term, to think about this becoming more of a standard of care, that's when we are going to have to really look to start to have more clinical data. But I wouldn't point you to anything at the podiums or anything near term. Operator : And we have Matthew O'Brien next with a question. Please proceed. Matthew O'Brien - William Blair : Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Was hoping we can start on the extremity side of things. Kevin, this is an area that just continues to kind of boggle the mind as far as your growth rates go. I think you are about doubling the market in foot and ankle. Can you just give us a sense of -- is that share coming from some of the larger multinationals that are playing there, or coming from some of the more extremities focused companies at this point? And then with the integration of SBI, is there any reason to think you can't, even though you have more difficult comparisons coming up, grow somewhere around the 30%, maybe mid-20s level going forward? Kevin Lobo : Well certainly, I am not going to speculate on the growth going forward, because certainly, they define my expectations thus far. So when you're entering a new market, its really hard to predict. Obviously, when you're in an existing market, its much more easy to predict what the volume will be. I would say, most of the growth is really coming from expanding the market. We are calling on new surgeons that weren't putting in implants before. That has been really the engine of growth. Obviously, new products that we have been launching as well. The STAR ankle really fills a very important gap in the product portfolio. So we are really excited about that. And frankly we see, in a new market like this, continued opportunity for growth. So we are growing the market primarily. We are obviously taking some share as well. But at this point, I think we see robust growth going into the future. But what exactly robust will be, will remain to be seen. But we are extremely pleased with the performance, the dedicated business unit model is working. The certain segmentation that we created is working, and we are very-very pleased with the performance. Matthew O'Brien - William Blair : Thanks. And as my follow-up, the neuro business which seems to get overlooked here, looks like it improved sequentially here in the third quarter, which historically has not done. Can you talk a little bit about what some of the growth drivers there? It sounds like, I think from last quarter, you mentioned hemorrhagic is the primary growth driver. Is the momentum in that business strengthening at this point? Kevin Lobo : We have three business units within our Neurotechnology business and all three businesses are performing very well. In fact, in this quarter, the neuro-powered instruments was really the strongest growth of the three. But neurovascular, which is really just the coils [ph] for neuro, also grew very-very well, as did our craniomaxillofacial business. That CMF business has been sort of a double digit growth business as well. Growing very well, with custom cranial implants and a number of other new products. So all three business contributing very evenly to the nice double digit performance. Matthew O'Brien - William Blair : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Good afternoon. Kevin and Katherine, to my recollection, minus five or -- Katherine Owen : Bruce sorry, can you just speak up a little bit? We are having trouble hearing you. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Yeah, I am sorry. To my recollection, could you hear me now? Kevin Lobo : Better. But if you can speak loudly please. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Yes. To my recollection, mid-single digit negative price in hips and knees in the U.S. is kind of at the high end of historical levels. Has there been a secular change and what might be driving that, and is it reversible? Katherine Owen : I would say, what we see -- there is nothing new in terms of the trends, whether its physicians becoming employees of hospitals and greater alignment there or transparency around patient pricing, and also keep in mind, product cycles. Accolade II for example, we got a nice price premium for that, but you do anniversary those from a couple of years into the launch. The product cycles definitely see an impact. So while it has declined, I wouldn't say, we are seeing a step function change. Mid single digits is in the 3% to 5% range. So again, nothing really significantly different, and clearly stable -- and are largely stable through the first three quarters of this year. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : Okay. And my follow-up Kevin is, clearly you guys -- Kevin Lobo : Bruce I am losing you. I am sorry Bruce. Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse : I am sorry. You didn't expect to have Stryker implants on MAKO this year. What is surprising you about the difficulty of MAKO robot placements? Katherine Owen : I think the biggest thing is just the pace of the integration, and we were probably a bit -- we weren't probably, we were overly optimistic on how quickly we could integrate and do all the coordination that's required between the capital reps and our very large Stryker implant reps, and there is a lot of coordination, particularly when you get into individual accounts. Certain regions have embraced it, they understand the differences in implant sales versus the CapEx sales and how to partner, and there we are seeing great success and uptick in utilization. But we are only a couple of quarters in and its going to take some time here to really leverage that breadth of combining those two sales forces. So nothing that's significant or really different. It was really just us being overly optimistic about the pace of managing that integration. Kevin Lobo : Yeah Bruce. The other thing I'd add is, there were certain parts of the country, where some of our customers wanted better use of their robots. So there was a bulk buy that you may have heard about, that HMA had done. CHS bought HMA as a big chain, and they weren't really pleased with the performance of some of their robots. So we actually went about transferring, and went through a big process to actually transfer and move about six or seven robots to [indiscernible] high performing locations. That look a lot of effort on the capital sales team that\u2019s normally focused on selling, to actually shift and transfer. That will pay dividends for us going forward, but its obviously tied up a lot of activity. So when you integrate a company, you have to go through these kinds of stumbles I would say. It certainly hasn't taken away any of our enthusiasm. The robot sales force is still intact, and the funnel is really nice and filling up very nicely. So we are excited about being able to continue to improve. But those are some of the stumbles we had to kind of go through. Relationships are everything and building relationships for the big recon sales force is time consuming. And so its below our expectations, but certainly the promise is every bit as exciting as we thought when we did the acquisition. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. Good afternoon Two follow-up questions on pricing. One, the mid single digit knee and hips pricing in the U.S., does that include or exclude mix? Or maybe the question should be, are you getting any mix in this environment? And then a question on spine, I think you called that out as pricing getting a little worse. Can you quantify what the spine pricing was, and provide some commentary why the spine pricing got worse? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yeah. So that is pure price. We are getting some mix, which is partly offsetting that, and that's what we report in a combined volume mix number being north of 10%. So a little bit of price, but it does not fully offset what we are seeing on the overall pure pricing side. In terms of spine, pricing there is challenging and that's part of the year-over-year decline in our pricing, to the 2.3% as Bill referenced. Part of it is just the mix of our businesses and greater pressure on certain types of products. But we are managing through that. Really excited about some of the new products and the leadership team that we have got in place there. So we expect to see some improvement going forward, but that's probably the key part that we would highlight. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity : Great. Thanks, good evening. So if I could just leverage off of Glenn's question and switch it over to the trauma. You mentioned pricing pressure on trauma. Maybe I have been paying attention, but historically that hasn't been an area that we have seen a lot of pressure, and I am just wondering, if you could give us more granularity on that? Then I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : So when we say pressure, its certainly a different type of pressure than you see in hips and knees. So its very low single digit. But trauma has historically been sort of flat. Sometimes we are going to be able to get a little bit in price, but if you look year-over-year, certainly, we did have a bit of single digit decline in price. Low single digit, it\u2019s a change, its nothing dramatic, but obviously if you look at how much market share we have taken over the last few years, and we are starting to get a little bit of pushback from some of our competitors, caused a small amount of price erosion, nothing that's concerning. If you look at the overall growth of our trauma business, it hasn't hampered our growth, and not something that we are overly worried about. Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity : Okay. And then just in terms of SBI, it\u2019s a more specific question, but you closed on the international component of that. I mean what -- Katherine, what type of contribution should we expect from them in the quarter's going forward? Katherine Owen : We haven't broken out the acquisition contribution by the individual pieces. I mean, clearly MAKO is the largest piece and we do have to go through the integration process with SBI. But I think with that group, with the foot and ankle up 30% without it, and then leveraging this product, we would expect a pretty healthy acceleration, obviously continuing to be in that double digit vicinity. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Thank you. Good evening guys. Wondered if I could start just one question on the spine side of the business, especially on the implant side, you know that has been kind of bumping along in the U.S. here, plus or minus a couple of points every quarter. We are starting to hear more and more pods or pod participation reversing in that. Any signs of that showing up, it doesn't seem like it in your numbers, but are you hearing anything out in the field along those lines? Kevin Lobo : No, it really hasn't changed. For every pod that goes away and new pods seems to pop up, it seems to be pretty stable overall. The fact that there is some prosecution, will hopefully turn that tide. We haven't seen that trend turn yet. For our business, obviously we had some challenges in the first quarter, we highlighted around some sales force disruptions. We are working our way through those challenges. We are also focused on upgrading our portfolio to have much more MIS products in our mix. Katherine just mentioned, we had spent some time with the spine team this week and very excited about the leadership. We have made some new leadership changes at spine, and exciting portfolio of products that we are going to start to see since the beginning of next year, which will hopefully make us less immune to the kind of price pressure that they have on the core spinal endpoint. Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird: Fair enough. Thanks Kevin. And then Bill, just a follow-up question for you; you mentioned the $0.10 to $0.12 kind of incremental hit, or at least a $0.10 to $0.12 hit from currency in 2015 at current rates. Is that incremental to how you're thinking about it, maybe in the second quarter, is all that from the movements just over the past three months, and I know you haven't guided 2015 yet, but would you kind of take a look at our 2015 numbers and whatever we were thinking last quarter, maybe take that dime out at this point, or how should we think about that? Bill Jellison : Sure. I think, one of the ways to kind of broadly take a look at that Jeff, that you should always be kind of watching. And it is definitely since the second quarter, in fact its really the changes that occurred really since the middle of August, on the rate side of the equation. So when rates move that much, and rates have generally moved about five to six percentage points across almost all the key currencies, we have got roughly 35% of our business is international. So think of in the kind of 2% range on our total earnings, just from the translation related impact. So that kind of should help kind of guide you to the level of impact that we would see on the overall operations. As we move forward, we don't know where rates are going to be as we move through, in the fourth quarter and into next year, right. So as we get a better look on it, we will obviously be giving better visibility when we give our broader guidance for 2015. Kevin Lobo : Plus we are obviously in the process of working through our budget for next year, and whether we will be able to offset any negative pricing is something we will provide more clarity to, in January. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink. You may proceed. Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I could just ask on the capital spending environment. Can you parse out where or what kind of products in the capital equipment domain, within your MedSurg division are -- where you think things are getting better. And is this kind of also applying for bigger ticket items; because it sounded like MAKO, you didn't necessarily have much of a pickup on placing systems, but obviously the lower ticket items within your MedSurg division are -- is that the right characterization? Katherine Owen : No. I would say MAKO is somewhat unique, because yes its capital, but really what we are focused on right now is the integration and the training and driving the coordination between our selling organizations and working with hospitals on the value proposition and the like. That's a little bit insulated or separate right now from the general hospital CapEx trends. I would say, if you look at our medical growth, clearly, very healthy, and that tends to be our larger ticket and more deferrable hospital capital equipment, and we are seeing good momentum and as we mentioned, early signs of an acceleration, recognizing its one quarter. So we will see how the fourth quarter plays out, but we are pretty optimistic about the momentum there. And then if you look at instruments, which has a lower component and a lower ticket CapEx, but still there, clearly whether its Neptune or excluding Neptune, they are seeing very healthy growth, which I think speaks more to the strength of the selling organization and the product portfolio and the value that Neptune brings, less so than a change that we are seeing in the hospital capital environment. Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up on the pricing. I just want to make sure I heard correctly. I think you said spine pricing net of mix was down 10%, is that right? And then two, is there anything specific that you saw in the last kind of three, four, five months, on kind of spine pricing contracts coming out or a big contract coming up? Katherine Owen : No. We didn't quote that number on spine pricing pressure. We are seeing pricing pressure in spine, and that really has to do partly with the product mix and some of the core spine fusion products. So we do think its going to improve going forward. Its clearly one of the contributors to the overall 2.3% pricing pressure we are seeing. Kevin Lobo : As it relates to contracts, they go through different cycles at different periods of time. So there isn't one overall contract that we'd point to. And if you've seen the spine market really, frankly over the last couple of years, a mid single digit decline in prices is what we generally see over a number of quarters. Operator : And our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman - Goldman Sachs : Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the gross margin. And I think the explanation around the trajectory is quite clear on what we have seen thus far. But as you look forward, as you add up the headwinds and tailwinds, at least the way I am thinking about, the headwinds are obviously product mix. In the near term, you have the impact of M&A and then pricing currency. But on the tailwind side, it seems like over time, some of those acquisition headwinds probably abate. You have the GQ&O efforts and then neuro seems to be doing pretty well, as is trauma and extremity. So can we --- what does it take to neutralize some of those forces around the gross margin line and flatten that out on a go forward basis. Bill Jellison : So let me just hit on a couple of the ones that you just talked about. So from an acquisition perspective, absolutely. Acquisitions impacted in a period only, right. Once it anniversaries itself, now its part of our base, and also keep in mind, as we move into the end of the integration of acquisitions, that's actually a piece that helps us improve margin rates over time, because we can ultimately leverage some of the benefits of our broader operations to the GQ&O team to help those acquisitions improve. So its really just the one year, where it wasn't in the base, but its in kind of the current numbers. As far as for the product side of the mix, the general product mix, the large part of that is driven really by how strong our equipment growth and instruments growth has been broadly in this quarter. And at 16% this quarter, that was very strong. So I think we are still expecting to see good instrument strength, and MedSurg growth as we move into the fourth quarter, especially since we have not fully anniversaried kind of the relaunch of our Neptune product. But over time, we would think that that balance would be a little bit more in line with some of our historical related averages. And then, as it relates to pricing; pricing is incrementally a little bit stronger here, and that is something that our broader based GQ&O team is focused on, knowing that we need to be working hard at our broad based cost improvement initiatives to help offset those types of costs. David Roman - Goldman Sachs : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Kevin or Katherine; as you think about the organic growth rate, at the Analyst Day, kind of one of the things that you tried to stress was the company's ability to sustain an above [indiscernible] growth rate, which obviously, based on the results today you're tracking well ahead of. But if you think, on a going forward basis, whether its in the context of the 5% to 6% that you're offering, what are the factors that lead things to be upside relative to either the current run rate, or what you're targeting here? Is it MAKO -- how much would have to come from the MAKO environment, versus anything you can do on the individual product side or share gain initiative? Kevin Lobo : So we're really obviously a growth oriented company, both in terms of the acquisitions that we pursue, as well as if you look at our R&D spend over the last few years. We are spending at a pretty healthy rate in R&D, and our new product cycle across all the division, which I get a chance to visit and do business reviews, are very exciting. So a combination of both internally developed products, as well as acquisitions, will continue to fuel, what Stryker has really been known for, for years and years and years, which are incredibly strong and talented sales organizations, that can really deliver results. And you're seeing that. You're seeing us perform above the market over quarter after quarter after quarter, and with the pipeline of products coming in and feeding into these really specialized dedicated sales forces, we see this as a sustainable engine for continued strong growth. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please proceed. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Hi thanks. Can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes we can. Hi Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Hi great. Good afternoon. So two things, first on the repatriation opportunity, I think this is an obviously question, but I just want to be clear. So that opportunity is an opportunity to bring cash back to the United States, without paying a tax penalty, correct? Kevin Lobo : So the tax penalty that we are talking about, would be relatively minor, and actually, part of the tax hit that you see in this quarter, include the cost of bringing back those funds. So once we, in essence, make a decision that we are ultimately going to be bringing back funds from O-U.S., which we actually did this quarter, we have to actually book that U.S. tax in our GAAP numbers right upfront once we make that decision, because the specific action associated with, on an expectation of how we are going to utilize that cash. So that's already reflected, and we would not expect to book any additional tax charge when we repatriate that, but we would then have the cash outflow of the tax that we have already accrued now. Bill Jellison : So Bob, so obviously the tax charge we have has two components. So it\u2019s a moving of the IP, as well as repatriation. But the repatriation is in the 5% kind of range, its similar to the tax that we paid when we had those holidays to bring back cash, a very-very nominal rate [indiscernible] bring back. If we try to bring back further dollars, then we would have to pay a much higher rate, which is not interesting to us. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America : Okay. I will want to understand the mechanism of that a little better. But I will save that for a later time. The other quick question I wanted to ask was just, back on pricing and the -- I understand the comment about sort of sequentially seeing a stability in the rate of change versus what you've seen over the last couple of quarters. But Kevin as you look forward, just maybe express your confidence that you can maintain relative stability in the level of decline in pricing versus where you're right now, as we again look forward into, not just Q4, but thinking about 2015. I think that's a hot button issue for a lot of investors, and we'd just love to hear reviews on how confident you are, that that can remain stable. Kevin Lobo : Well Bob, obviously I don't have a crystal ball to know exactly what the future is going to hold. I would say there are no new dynamics at play. So these are the same dynamics we have been saying over the last couple of years around physician-hospital alignment, around contracting, the pressure that hospitals are feeling. So its similar dynamics. We are seeing stability over the course of the last couple of quarters. It is a little bit more under pressure than it was in the prior year. But if we saw a new catalyst that would be something that I'd be more worried about. But its really the same catalyst and contracts sort of come and go. There is different cycles that are underway, and as MAKO ramps and as we start to place robots, we really believe that as a fantastic differentiator for us, and something that we will be able -- for Stryker at least, to insulate us from some of the price pressure going forward. So that for us is one of the key advantages. But the marketplace hasn't fundamentally changed. There are no new catalysts. If there were, then that would be -- it would create a lot more uncertainty for me, and what we are seeing right now. We are seeing pretty good discipline among the competitive players in the marketplace. So from that standpoint, there will be some consolidation pending in the industry. I think that's also a catalyst for more stability generally, if you look at other industries and what's happening in other industries. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus : Hi. Good afternoon everybody. Couple of questions; SG&A clearly going down as a percentage of sales. Trying to understand, where do we go from here? How sustainable is this directionally? Is this is a onetime one year, major stepdown or with [indiscernible] charges are a lot more to come. Just help us think about that, if you would? Kevin Lobo : So on the SG&A side of the equation, we have been averaging about roughly 1.5% of improvement as a percent of sales this year. This last quarter, obviously a little bit stronger again than that. But I'd say, when we can grow at the levels that we just grew at, we can absolutely get additional leverage from our broader based operations, and that's what we are generally driving throughout all the goals and expectations for each of the different divisions. We on top of that, obviously have a number of different cost initiatives to try and make sure that we are focused on taking costs out of the organization, where it makes sense. So I'd say that we made good progress on a number of fronts over the last couple of years, and I'd say that we still believe that there is some good progress yet to be made. So I don't think we talk about an endpoint, but I would say that, if we continually can grow north of kind of the 5% range in general, that we can typically get some good leverage off of that, moving forward. Bill Jellison : Yeah, specifically related to G&A. So on the selling side, we have taken out quite a bit of expense on the selling line this year, and some in the G&A area. But in G&A, we still have significant room for savings, by driving more shared services, where we have just a couple of small pockets in Stryker right now, that have moved to shared services. We have not generalized that across the corporation, and that's something we will be pushing forward in the next couple of years. Kevin Lobo : I just want to emphasize, this European headquarters was a massive undertaking. So you're seeing the side of the benefits related to repatriation of cash and tax improvements. But to actually provide system changes and to remap all of our transactions involved, hundreds of people across our organization over the last year to put this change into effect. So we will see those benefits, but those resources were burning a lot of energy on this project. We are now going to turn their focus and their attention on driving more shared services. And so we see room to continue to drive efficiency and leverage. Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus : That's great Kevin. And my follow-up, again I don't know if I should put these in the same sentence, but the $2 billion repatriation and the comment about reinvesting 50% of the tax savings etc, could this potentially help you offset some of the clearly obvious FX headwinds in some way, could you reinvest a smaller amount of the tax savings or be more aggressive. Are these levers we should believe or assume that you're reflecting on as you put together your 2015 plan? Kevin Lobo : There are a lot of dynamics and a lot of variables as we put together a plan. So a lot of what you say will be things that we will think through and will provide clear guidance in January and characterize those elements for you in a very clear manner. Operator : And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wanted to focus on the tax rate. I think you said, if I heard correctly, that you expect it to be down sequentially in Q4, but you still expect to come in at about 22% for the full year, and that the R&D tax credit would be reflected in Q4. I guess, did I hear correctly and that would seem to get you down to about 21%. So maybe if you could help clarify my misunderstanding? Bill Jellison : Sure. Yeah, that's a little bit of a misunderstanding there. But we are expecting -- we have got a year-to-date adjusted operating effective tax rate of about 22% so far year-to-date. That's actually the rate that we are expecting for the full year, which would imply that the fourth quarter will be relatively close to that rate. As we move forward though into 2015, we do expect to reduce our average tax rate from 14 to 15 by about two full percentage points. So if we average roughly 22 this year, you should be thinking in the neighborhood of around 20% next year, as you are looking at 2015. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Got it. So that means, if the -- sorry, go ahead. Bill Jellison : Just maybe one other point of clarification which was around the tax extender comment. So the tax extenders are currently in our year end forecast. So if those don't come, then obviously that puts a little bit additional pressure on this year's tax, but hopefully at the end of the day, if it doesn't come this year, we would sure expect it to come next year and may have like a double year benefit, as we did back in 2012. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo : Got it. That's helpful. And then the Q4 implied guidance, if my math is correct, is 3% to 7%. I understand you have one less selling day in Q4, but is there any reason that you would be towards the low end of the guidance, given the strength and momentum we saw this quarter? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Fourth quarter is pretty volatile as we have seen in the past, and certainly capital equipment is a big thrust in the fourth quarter, and is inherently volatile. So based on how we close this quarter, I wouldn't think we'd be expecting to be at the low end of the range. But it\u2019s a range, and there is unknowns that could happen. But we are certainly feeling -- at this point, we are feeling pretty good, but its always inherently volatile. Operator : And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : We can now Joanne. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks and good evening. Thanks for taking the question. We have heard on a couple of calls say for about O-U.S. weakness, it has ranged from problem in Europe to problems in the Middle East and other areas. Could you please comment if you are experiencing any of this? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So for us it\u2019s a little different given the makeup of our business. So in Europe, we have a smaller business that we have really strengthened over the last couple of years. We had a strong quarter in Europe, again in the third quarter. And so, we may not be indicative of the overall broad market based on our presence. China, we had extremely strong growth, well north of 20%. India was very strong. Now look at all the emerging markets, we were very strong double digit growth. Even if I look at our EMEA, our region had a good performance. So clearly, Russia and Turkey are two areas that are problematic. But beyond those two areas, the rest of our international -- and we feel pretty good about our performance, and the markets are holding up well. The challenges that we had in Japan are I would say more Stryker specific challenges, beyond obviously the price cuts, that everyone experienced. We have some of our own challenges. But international for us is a bright spot, and we are feeling -- our organic growth was very strong in Q3, and the overall negatives that I have heard as well, haven't really applied as much to Stryker. It could be based on our market presence, and the momentum that we have in those regions. Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets : That's helpful. And as a follow-up question, the two points that you will experience in tax reduction in 2015, does that become status quo, or is there still more room for you to move it down? Thank you. Bill Jellison : That's a loaded question. I think that you can assume that we have a number of different areas that we want to continue to focus on, and ultimately can see opportunities for improvement, but also keep in mind that worldwide, pressures within different municipalities around the world, both in the U.S. and other European and international countries, are all looking for ways to increase their broader based revenue. So while we have opportunities on improvement, there is also the broader pressure on areas where governments or different areas are trying to help or reduce kind of those levels, from at least the impact on their overall tax rate. So we are absolutely focused on it, and we are going to continue to make efforts there. But as far as projecting it, we aren't projecting anything in Jan 2015. Kevin Lobo : If you look at the last 10 years in Stryker's performance on this line, it has been pretty steady and pretty meaningful improvements; and this is a big change which required a -- it was a big project. But you shouldn't assume that we are content and that we are going to just sit still. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor - Barclays: Hi, couple of questions. So you had a really nice quarter on your capital business and talk about this improving environment; that's a little inconsistent with some of the other results we have seen and what hospitals are talking about. So I am just curious if there is anything to do with new products or big orders or you really think that they are opening up for whatever reason, is it ACA or some factor in Europe that we are not seeing, because a lot of other things that we have seen so far, seem to point to relatively weak capital market? Kevin Lobo : I would go back to our comments which were -- we are seeing signs of a moderate improvement in the capital environment. Its very difficult for us to know how much of that is just us executing better than competitors, versus an overall strengthening in the market. But just looking at our medical results and looking at our pipeline and thinking about the momentum we are seeing really across our MedSurg businesses on the implant and the capital side, that's what we are seeing now. Again its just one quarter, and we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we feel pretty good about sings of at least a moderate improvement in the overall environment. Matt Taylor - Barclays: And then on ortho, are you seeing any disruption from other big deals that are going on in the space? Is that something you could take advantage of, and what are you doing well in hips and knees that your competitors aren't doing that? Kevin Lobo : So I'd say, related to consolidation and disruption, we are not really seeing much in the way of disruption yet. As we saw with the previous big acquisition, the disruption really didn't occur sort of post implementation. Once implementation begins and people really understand what does this mean to me, that's when we really start to see disruption. So I would say its sort of business as usual right now, and we are seeing a pretty stable marketplace, at least at this point, once the companies integrate, that's usually when we see -- tend to see more turmoil. As it relates to our performance, the story on hips is not a new story, somewhat like trauma. Trauma of course, double digits, and continued sustained performance; in hips, if you go back 12 quarters, we have been growing faster than the market, at a pretty steady rate. A combination of some new products like Accolade II, as well as really strong execution in the field; and then on the knee business, we have just been performing with the market, which is a very good performance, given that we had two large competitive launches, that we have been able to perform well. So our field sales organization has done really an excellent job, and we feel we are in a very good position. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan: I think I had everything answered. Thanks guys. Kevin Lobo : Thank you, Mike. Operator : And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I just wanted to confirm two things, I guess; one on the FX, the $0.10 to $0.12 that is incremental to what you would expect to finish 2014 at? Bill Jellison : That's correct. That's the year-over-year impact that we would see next year. Kevin Lobo : That's if exchange rates stay at their current levels. Bill Jellison : Based on current rates, right. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : And this year, what is the total FX included within your forecast roughly? Bill Jellison : The FX that we are talking about in 2014 is now up to about $0.12 negative impact for us, and that's about $0.04 worse than what we expected at the end of the second quarter. Most of that $0.04 differential is occurring in the fourth quarter. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So Bill mentioned before, once that hit us in the third quarter, if the rates stay where they are now, there would be a $0.03 additional hit in the fourth quarter. So its just coincidental that that $0.12 would be similar to next year. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just a bigger picture I guess, if we look at the overall pricing dynamics of hips and knees down in the mid single digits. We are still seeing really strong, obviously sales growth and I don't suspect mix is contributing all that much, so its really implying you got unit volume growth probably somewhere in the mid to high single digits. How long do you think you can seek kind of this high single digit volume growth, really sustain itself, and what would be a more normalized unit growth environment? Katherine Owen : I think its fair to say that your statements are correct mix. It has just been a modest benefit, nowhere near offsetting price, and the unit volume growth is very healthy. Certainly in the case of hips, we think that is also reflective of consistent market share gains. And its difficult to know exactly what the market is going to grow at on a go forward basis. We have been talking about it being largely stable. We don't see any reason really to move away from that. What we are really focused on though, is how do we drive market share gains, whether its with our existing portfolio and products like Accolade II, or obviously getting into next year and beyond leveraging the MAKO. So its really all about market share being our focus. Its 5 :45, I think we are going to wrap the call up operator. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2014 results will be held on January 27, 2015. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird Operator : Welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cuba and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly reports, before turning to question and answers. Our topline performance in Q4 reflected our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high end of MedTech. With both the fourth quarter and full year revenue increasing close to 6%, excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions, we maintained strong sales momentum and delivered results at the high end of our initial expectations of 4.5% to 6% growth. Q4 results were impacted by one less selling day, which negatively impacted sales by approximately 1%. Somewhat to prior quarters, our diversified revenue base remains a key advantage as all three business segments; Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine, again delivered positive year-over-year gains. In the U.S., Orthopedics, which is up against very tough comparisons from 2013 registered over 7% growth. Trauma and extremities including foot and ankle continued it's impressive multi-year track record with healthy double-digit growth. Hips once again posted strong results while knees came in flat. Turning to MAKO, we're gaining considerable momentum with the sale of 20 robots in the quarter, up from eight in Q3 and the highest level of quarterly units ever achieved. Q4 also represented the highest MAKO procedure volume increasing double-digits year-over-year. Katherine will provide additional details regarding the number of key milestones for MAKO that we're targeting in 2015. U.S. MedSurg had a standout quarter led by impressive organic growth for both instruments and medical. Continued gains for Neptune, our strengthening hospital CapEx environment and strong sales force execution drove these results. Our U.S. Neurotechnology businesses continued their momentum with double-digit growth, which more than offset some softness in our core spine business. Coming off a strong Q3 of this year and strong comps from Q4 of last year, our international businesses grew nearly 4% in constant currency. Our challenges in Japan, which began in Q2 with a difficult ERP implementation continued and were acute in hips and knees. Our other divisions had good performances and we are particularly pleased with our results in China and sustained growth in Europe. Gross margin came in slightly above Q3 levels, reflecting similar trends we experienced throughout the year, including pricing headwinds, the negative effect of mix and foreign exchange, while also reflecting ongoing improvements in cost of goods sold. We remain focused on reducing operating cost with SG&A as a percentage of sales decreasing by 140 basis points year-over-year. R&D increased the year-over-year both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, underscoring our ongoing commitment to innovation, both internal development and acquisitions, the benefits of which are apparent in out topline performance. Looking ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to continue our growth. The new European regional headquarters coupled with our just launched transatlantic operating model will set the stage for multiyear improvement in our growth profile in Western Europe and while some emerging markets have been more challenging, we remain bullish on growth prospects in China and India. Headroom remain most notably a significant negative foreign exchange impact on EPS of $0.30 a share based on current rates. However with a strong topline, ongoing reductions and operating cost and a healthy balance sheet and cash flow, we're well positioned to optimize shareholder value. For 2015, we're targeting organic sales growth of 4.5% to 6% with adjusted EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 a share, up 4% to 8%. Excluding the impact of core foreign currency, our underlying EPS growth would be in the range of 10% to 14%. Given the heightened volatility and foreign exchange rates, we will update these impacts each quarter throughout the year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on the performance of our recent key acquisitions. In early January, we completed our most recent acquisition of privately held CHG hospital beds, which show a series of innovative, low height hospital beds and related accessories in markets across Canada, the U.S. and U.K. The low height design helps reduce the risk of patient falls that are related to entering and exiting hospital beds. Amongst CHG's innovative offerings is the recently launched Spirit One bed, which is an expandable low-height bariatric bed for the acute care segment. With this acquisition we're able to expand medical offerings of products that enhance the quality of care for both patients and healthcare professionals by helping to prevent patient related injuries resulting from a fall from a hospital bed. Turning to MAKO, as Kevin mentioned, we're excited about the increasing momentum we're experiencing. In late 2014 we submitted the 510-K application for our total knee on the MAKO robot and continue to target 2015 for FDA clearance. Given the necessary training and education post approval, we assume any revenue contribution from this indication will be somewhat limited in 2015, we expect to see a more meaningful ramp in 2016. Beyond the total knee, we're targeting Q2 for a limited release of our cement less uni knee on the robot and we're also preparing to launch Stryker's hip power brands including our highly successful accolade hip on the robot this year as well as our X3 poly bearings. In summary, the teams have made tremendous progress on the pipeline over the past 12 months and going forward, we're well positioned to drive adoption and leverage the considerable breadth of Stryker's reconstructive sales and marketing presence. Lastly I'll provide a few comments on one of our most recent acquisitions, Small Bone Innovations, which we acquired in August of last year. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making with sales tracking well against our plan. We've conducted extensive training over the past six months, which will continue into the first quarter and it includes the entire SBI portfolio of products. The STAR Ankle is an important addition to our foot and ankle portfolio and with our dedicated sales force, we expect to see continued strong momentum in 2015. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Jellison : Thanks Katherine. Sales growth was 6.1% in the fourth quarter including a negative 2.6% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 8.6% which includes organic growth of 5.5%. Sales growth for the full year was 7.3% with organic growth of 5.8%, acquisition growth of 2.5% and a negative 1% impact from FX translation. EPF on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter were $0.67 per share versus $1.01 per share last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.44 per share in the quarter versus $1.29 per share in the quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s EPS includes negative impact of approximately $0.06 from FX or $0.02 to $0.03per share worse than the prevailing Fx rates that we signaled on our third quarter earnings call. Foreign exchange rates were very volatile during the fourth quarter and the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, the Euro and any other currencies continue to weaken against the dollar. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the full year of 2014 were $1.34 versus $2.63 last year while adjusted earnings per share were $4.73 versus $4.49 per share last year. CapEx negatively impacted the full year results by approximately $0.14 per share. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter included charge of approximately $116 million net of approximately $179 million of insurance recoveries received associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. The adjustment also included an additional tax expense associated with the transfer of intellectual properties of the Netherlands from some of our other European locations. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time and as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. Looking at sales in the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate of 5.5% was comprised of a positive 7.4% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 2% points. Acquisitions added 3.1% while FX added a negative 2.6% in the overall sales for the quarter. Looking at our segments, Orthopedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopedic products were up 1.7% as reported and grew 4.5% at constant currency and increased 1.8% organically. US Orthopedics sales grew 7.3% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 18.7% and mid-single digit in international markets with approximately 25% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have great success in an expanding market. U.S. hips continued to increase its strong performance and grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter while U.S. knees were flat and internationally sales were down 5% in hips and reflect in knees in constant currency as negative pricing and operational performance in Japan and comps were tougher within the period. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 12.1% as-reported and 14.1% in constant currency and increased 9.4% organically. These results benefited from double-digit growth in our instruments business, as we continued our strong performance across our product lines and reestablished clear market leadership with the Neptune product back on the market this year. These are on a like-to-like comparison with Neptune as we re-launched the product in the first quarter of 2014. We also had upper teen growth in endoscopy, driven by recent acquisitions. Medical also had a strong mid-teen organic and constant currency growth this quarter as the hospital capital market is picking up and we are driving excellent sales execution. Our final segment Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 18% of our sales in the quarter, increased 3.9% as reported and 7% in constant currency with 6.3% organic growth. Growth in this segment was led by double-digit growth in our Neurotechnology businesses and IVS while spinal implant sales decreased slightly. And looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2014 were nearly flat sequentially at 66.1%. This compares to 66.3% in the same quarter last year. The decline in the margin rates in the quarter resulted both from negative product mix and negative price pressures. Our mix was negative in this quarter due to the impact of recent acquisitions and strong sales of our MedSurg products. These products have a lower gross margin rate than the company average. Pricing was down 2% in the quarter and also 2% for the full year. Pricing pressure remains challenging and is expected to be down approximately 2% for the company moving forward. Margins were also negatively impacted from foreign exchange movements compared to last year. Research and development expenses were 5.8% of sales, slightly higher than last year in the quarter and this is a 10% increase in R&D spending over last year, while still nicely leveraging our overall operating expenses in the period. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis expenses were $857 million or 32.7% of sales in the quarter versus 34% in the prior year period. Strong sales growth and our cost improvement efforts delivered over a four percentage point of operational expense leverage in both the quarter and in the full year. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 26.% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The rate was positively impacted by operational improvements and solid improvements in operating expense leverage partially offset by lower pricing, acquisition and product mix and foreign exchange rates in the quarter. Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 43.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6%. This compares to a 24.2% adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned earlier, we have officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam. Last year, we transferred intellectual property from other countries within Europe to the Netherlands and also made decisions to repatriate nearly $2 billion from Europe to the US. Most of those funds will be transferred to the US in the back half of 2015. These actions triggered a tax expense between both in the third and fourth quarter of this year. The cash outflows repayment of this tax will be fully paid out in the first half of 2.15. The transfer of the intellectual property provides us more flexibility in managing our operations in the future and aligns the ownership with where our primary European leadership team will be located. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. And from an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the fourth quarter at 54 or one day better than the fourth quarter of last year or of 2013 and Days in inventory finished the quarter at 160 days, which was a eight day increase compared to 152 days in the fourth quarter last year due to acquisitions and some higher inventory in some of our international locations. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in 2014 was $1.8 billion which was similar to 2013. Capital expenditures were $233 million in 2014 compared to $195 million in 2013. Share repurchases, we still have over $500 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as approximately $100 of share repurchases were made at 2014 but no additional shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter. As we look to 2015, our sales guidance includes constant currency growth of 5.5% to 7% with organic sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 6%. The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels. We expect net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3% to 4% points. Each quarter had the same number of selling days in 2015 as in 2014. Pricing pressure will continue and is expected to be lower by approximately 2% for the company moving forward consistent with the pricing environment we experienced throughout 2014. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2015 will be closer to 20% or over two full percentage points lower than in 2014. As mentioned previously, we plan on reinvesting approximately half of our tax savings associated with European Regional Head Quarters. These additional investments will be to support our new structure within Europe and to supplement our selling and marketing activities. Please also note that the renewal of the tax extenders for 2015 is reflected in our projected tax rate and our earnings guidance for the full year. However, we do not have any benefit planned in our first quarter guidance and we don\u2019t expect them to be approved until late in the year. If the extenders are not approved and made effective again this year, it will negatively impact our earnings guidance for the full year by approximately $0.05 per share. Capital expenditures are expected to be slightly over $300 million in 2015 and as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure and assuming there are no debt increases for acquisitions or significant share repurchases, we would expect net interest expense to run approximately $30 million for quarter on an average for 2015. Based on the current FX rates, we would expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.30 per share for the full year and approximately $0.08 for the quarter -- the first quarter. This is higher than we have shared a few weeks ago as the Euro has weakened further by nearly four to five percentage points and the Swiss Franc suddenly strengthened approximately 15% after it decoupled its currency sealing from the Euro recently. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of FX on earnings is being offset by both natural and real hedges which we continue to layer into our operations. And finally, 2015 adjusted net earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the first quarter of 2015. Thanks for your support and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : Great. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Weinstein : Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Bill Jellison : Yeah we can. Mike Weinstein : Okay perfect. Let me start with a balance sheet question and for those who weren\u2019t at the conference couple of weeks ago, we had talked about the comments that Stryker put in the press release on the preliminary 4Q numbers about utilizing the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, the company didn\u2019t buyback any stock. Can you just talk about just kind of current thoughts on A; why didn\u2019t you buyback any stock in the fourth quarter? And could you just give us some more of your thoughts relative to the use of the balance sheet in 2015 just building off the comments you made a couple of weeks back? Kevin Lobo : Yeah Mike. So this is Kevin. So what I would tell you on that is what I have been consistently saying which is the first priority for cash is for acquisitions and obviously the timing of acquisitions is unpredictable. And that if those acquisitions don\u2019t materialize in a reasonable period of time, then we would be open to larger share buybacks. So right now, we are pursuing the acquisition deal flow and we'll see what happens. Mike Weinstein : Okay and the -- is the plan -- so the plan for now, don\u2019t buyback any stock until you have a better read on the M&A environment and depending on how it plays out, then you would start to buy back stock, but ultimately the goal is the thought process at least is to end the year with a balance sheet that has more leverage than it does going into the year? Katherine Owen : Maybe I will chime in with a couple of comments. There is really no change from our expectations from prior years as Kevin said, M&A is the primary use, in any given year we assume something in the $400 million range in terms of share repurchases and I think that should be the assumption around expectations at the start of this year given what we know. And then if the deal flow doesn\u2019t keep pace as Kevin mentioned before, we would be open to larger buybacks, but as a going in assumption what\u2019s reflected in our range is the normal something in that $400 million-ish vicinity in terms of normal year buybacks. It will vary quarter-to-quarter for a variety of reasons, but that should be a good assumption that\u2019s reflected in the range we put out. Mike Weinstein : Katherine, the comment from the press release and from a couple of weeks back relative to exiting 2015 with a different balance sheet and the company entered 2015. That still holds the idea that the company does have a different view than Stryker had historically on utilizing the balance sheet? Bill Jellison : Yeah Mike. What I\u2019d say, we didn\u2019t put a specific timeframe. In the press release we didn\u2019t say exiting 2015, but what we did say is we acknowledge the strength of our balance sheet and that we do plan to put our money to work. So while we weren\u2019t specific in timing, we do say that over a reasonable period of time, we will not stay at the kind of balance sheet position that we are in right now and it's possible for me to put a precise date on that, given the timing of our deal flows, but the statement was put in there for a reason. And the reason the statement was put in there is to acknowledge the strength of the balance sheet and that we do plan to put it to work, but we were not specific in terms of whether that will be over a six month, nine months, 12 months period of time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead David. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Kevin, I think the one issue in the quarter is lot of strength in a lot of different segments but U.S. recon and obviously O.U.S. Japan you talked about but it wasn\u2019t clear in the U.S. what specifically is pressuring hips and knees. It looks like the price was stable sequentially. Many of your competitors also dealt with more challenging comps. Was there anything specific you can point us to in U.S. subsidies, which could have driven the incremental comp adjusted deceleration? And in your assumptions in 2015 can you give us a sense of what that assumes in terms of this strong CapEx business? Does it also assume a recon here in the U.S. in the first half of '15? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so David. What I\u2019d say is we certainly had very strong comps from the prior year right. We have are plus 10% in the U.S. in hips, we were plus 8% in the U.S. in knees, but we haven\u2019t seen all of our competitors report yet. So I\u2019d really want to wait to see how everybody else reports before we determine how our results stack up versus all of the competition. I would say we didn\u2019t notice the same kind of spike in the fourth quarter of 2014 as we noticed in the fourth quarter of 2013. And so normally, what we see over a six-month period is you'll start to see a big spike and then you see a drop off. So we will see what happens over the course of the first quarter this year, but I would think with the spike being not as dramatic that we won\u2019t see quite as much of a drop off this quarter, but we still believe we're doing well in the market with knees. We've been holding our own over the last couple of years and don\u2019t anticipate that anything major has changed there. And as it relates to the CapEx environment, certainly we had a fantastic fourth quarter of last year across all of our MedSurg businesses and medical in particular had a very, very strong jump towards the end of the year. We're seeing a better environment overall. We're also executing very, very well in the field. So we do expect continued strong momentum in MedSurg in 2015. Operator : Thank you. And now our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Bob Hopkins : Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes, we can Bob. Bob Hopkins : Great, good afternoon. So just to follow up on Mike\u2019s question on basically the guidance and the balance sheet, so you're guiding to $4.90 to $5.10 and Katherine, I think you said that assumes a normalized $400 million in buyback. So is it sort of a logical conclusion here that if there are no larger deals, then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019d have a larger buyback which would put upward pressure on this EPS range that you're providing today? Katherine Owen : I think Bob that the assumption that $300 million to $400 million that\u2019s the normal walking around in any given year level of buybacks and exactly if the pace of acquisitions isn\u2019t such that it\u2019s keeping up with the cash flow we generate, we would be open to doing larger buybacks. There is a lot of variables that go into what could impact the upper or lower end of our range and obviously FX is probably the biggest one but clearly just isolating that to the degree that buybacks are larger and that would be reflected towards the upper end of the range. Bob Hopkins : Okay. And then one follow-up for Bill, could you just walk me through the comment that your guidance here is assuming that you'll drive 10% to 14% underlying EPS growth obviously ex the currency impact. So I guess a little over 5% of that is from revenue growth, 2% from tax rate, a little bit from buyback, how much underlying operating margin leverage are you assuming in 2015 in this guidance? Bill Jellison : Sure actually Bob within a current year guidance, we don\u2019t give operational income related guidance. I think that what we have said in the past is that we do drive to get operating leverage in the 20 to 30 basis points or so per year, on an average, at least over a two or three year period of time. Keep in mind that we also mentioned earlier this year and also just now on the call as far as that we are planning to reinvest some of the dollars associated with the tax improvements in the rate side of equation back into some of the expense categories. So you probably won\u2019t see as much leverage overall within the operating income side as we would normally be driving especially in the expense category. Operator : Thank you. Go ahead. Bill Jellison : So I was just going to add Bob, on the EPS line, the 10% to 14% improvement is clearly a strong underlying performance on earnings per share and the tax benefit is about 1.5. So if you assume that the $0.07 is reinvested, it's about 1.5% improvement. So even if you take the 1.5 out, it\u2019s still growing EPS significantly faster than our top line in 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Kristen Stewart : Hi thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just go over again the international performance within the orthopedic business. I know you commented on Japan, but maybe if you could help us just understand how quickly it will take to turn that around and just remind us again the breakout of what Europe did relative to Japan in the quarter? Kevin Lobo : Yeah so Kristen just a high level I\u2019d say, Japan is certainly the biggest market that we have internationally and we mentioned on past two calls that we had an ERP system that didn\u2019t go very well. That system is now stabilized. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that while we're going through our challenges especially in the hip and knee market which has instruments and sets and where system reliability is extremely important. We certainly lost market share and we now need to regain that market share and just because our system is fixed, the business is not going back to us automatically. So we have to re-earn that business. I would think that we will start to see that improve beginning in the second quarter of next year. I would say Europe overall continues to perform well slightly pacing with growth and slightly pacing above the market. In any given quarter, you can see variations between our capital equipment and our implants and we don't sort of break down every single country and regions between implants in capital, but I\u2019d say that the biggest reason for that sluggishness in recon and particularly in hips is Japan. And that\u2019s a market that historically has been very reliable for us and where we have very strong market share, but certainly it has been a drag in the second half of this year and particularly in the fourth quarter and we're going to turn that around. So I would assume by the end of '15, we will be back but it\u2019s -- like we saw in Europe. It took us a little bit of time. This one unfortunately was a bit self-inflected. I expected that I have a new CIO and a new leadership team in our information technology group. The CIO was hired at the end of May and he has added four new leaders to his team. So I am a lot more optimistic about future ERP implementations but this one certainly has been challenging and had a knock-on effect of losing market share. Kristen Stewart : So just to make sure I understood, you said that Japan is going to continue to be a drag. This year we won\u2019t see improvement until the second quarter of 2016? Kevin Lobo : No 2015. Kristen Stewart : '15, okay. Kevin Lobo : We'll start to see improvement by the end of 2015 -- by the second quarter of '15. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Kevin Lobo : But it won\u2019t get fully back I don't think towards the end of the year. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Raj Denhoy : Hi thank you. I wondered if I could ask you a bit about the Mako performance in the quarter. You may be highlighted the 20 orders that you placed. I am curious maybe you can offer in terms of where are those replaced, what\u2019s driving that demand? And then secondly as you prepare to launch the -- or get approval and launch the knee product in the U.S., when might we see some data in terms of some of the performance attributes of that product? Katherine Owen : Yeah I will take that and we weren\u2019t really pleased. Obviously we had some integration challenges earlier in the year and -- but we worked through a lot of those and being able to really leverage the breadth of our sales and marketing infrastructure. I won\u2019t be specific about which locations and where we placed the 20 robots. I would say though the teams have done a great job of making sure when they do place a robot, it\u2019s in a facility that has a clear surge and champion and that really is key to ensuring that the utilization rates and the procedure volume is consistent with the expectations when we place that. So they're in the right locations and we will continue to drive that strategy going forward. In terms of clinical data, there is -- we will have data at AOS. There is a number of studies that have been done but it will take time. The early adopters will be less focused on longer term follow-up studies, but we're investing a lot in clinical data and understanding importance to driving long-term wide-scale adoption. Raj Denhoy : If I could ask, maybe one follow-up on that? In terms of -- I think you highlighted that when you looked at the investments you made in various areas. Maker really was your investment in orthopedics or has been to date in kind of orthopedics and I am -- I guess I am curious about how you view that investment? Is this really where you're seeing the future of orthopedics developing over time or do you still think there is a role for sort of the old way of doing orthopedics as well? Katherine Owen : Well, we\u2019ve made a number of bets in various sizes within orthopedics if you look at SBI and foot and ankle for trauma in extremities which falls under that umbrella but in terms of the largest bet, yes clearly MAKO is a big bet. We're in the enviable position and given our balance sheet and our cash generation, we can continue to do the tucking deals which tend to be the majority of our M&A, but make these bigger bets. We really believe it is going to revolutionize how orthopedic surgery, reconstructive surgery is performed. We think the total knee, which we filed for in late 2014 is by far the biggest market opportunity and it is a big bet. We believe we can drive meaningful market share gains, which has really never been done on a sustained basis in the reconstructive market. So it\u2019s a clear bet on the direction that the industry is going to go and the benefit that we can bring to patients, to surgeons and to the overall healthcare systems with the technology that we got with the robot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Jason Wittes : Hi. Thank you very much. So last week, I attended a podiatric meeting and I was very surprised at how well you guys have been doing in building out large contract with hospitals, especially in the foot and ankle business, but also amongst trauma and extremities. So I guess, I just wanted to kind of get a better sense of your strategy here. Should we assume that when you're looking at those areas, those are areas that you look at as right for hospital contracting and some type of bundling? Is that kind of the right way to think about it? Kevin Lobo : We'll, we shifted our focus about three years ago to moving towards full account conversions, which is frankly something that wasn\u2019t possible. Five, six years ago we didn\u2019t have the product portfolio to be able to do like a complete account conversion and so we would have niche products in different hospitals around the country and that shift and focus to total account conversion took us a little bit of time, but it\u2019s not working. So we're providing the service, we have all the products in our portfolio either through primarily internal development, but also supplemented by acquisitions where we can actually run the entire trauma service center and service line of a hospital. And then obviously foot and ankle, there is a presence within the hospital, but there is also podiatric surgeons that are operating outside of a hospital. So we have a dedicated team that sells outside the hospital and we have our existing trauma and extremities sales force that\u2019s selling inside the hospital. So we are very pleased with the -- obviously the performance. The market share we've been gaining over the past five years, steady growth as well as getting into a new market and growing our sales in foot and ankle where people were not using implants before. So it\u2019s been a great experience over the past few years to watch the foot and ankle business grow. With the SBI acquisition, we've also acquired some upper extremity products that look very exciting and I think that\u2019s the market that we see as right for growth as well and we will be piloting some specialized sales people in the upper extremities area and we look to grow that going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Derrick Sung : Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I was wondering if I could first get your thoughts on a few aspects around the consolidation that\u2019s happening across the industry namely in the near term, are you seeing any potential advantages from the disruptions with the potential -- upcoming consolidations from one of your large competitors. Longer term, how do you see the price environment evolving with consolidation in the industry and do you see room for further consolidation beyond where we are at today? Kevin Lobo : Yeah so I am not going to talk about further consolidation, but what I would say is every time there is an acquisition in the space, there is disruption. So we certainly saw that with a few [some] [ph]. We saw disruption and many of our competitors as well as us were able to capitalize on that. I think with the upcoming mergers in the environment, there will be disruptions. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. I think once the acquisition happens, you will see some sort of disruption. We plan for that ourselves and we do acquisitions. We did the SBI acquisition we planned for a certain level of disruption. We experienced some disruption of our own when we did the MAKO integration. So integrations will always create some form of disruption. It tends not to be long term in nature, but certainly something that we look to capitalize upon as any competitors of ours would have mergers or acquisitions in their space. Derrick Sung : And what about the pricing environment? Do you expect that to change at all with the consolidation that we're seeing? Kevin Lobo : Yeah what I would rather sort of step back and look at across all industries. When you see consolidation, generally you tend to see a moderating of your price impact. So that will have to play itself out, but normally in any other market when you see the number of competitors reducing, you do tend to see and in our case, obviously a market that has rapid price erosion, you would imagine that that would start to moderate over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. David Roman : Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I want to start with a question for Kevin. You did talk quite a bit about some of the trend internationally. You referenced the Europe experience and now what\u2019s going on in Japan, but maybe you could just talk about more broadly your ex U.S. strategy that sort of looking at your business compared to the peers. International does represent a smaller percentage of total and given some of the fits and starts in that business, are you undertaking more of a broader review of how international is being run and what gives you confidence in the sustainability of a turnaround in those franchises? Kevin Lobo : Yeah so for us, emerging markets represent 8% of our sales and still does now and obviously, even with strong U.S. dollar, which is driving up its share of our overall sales. In that, we had strong growth in emerging markets, strong double digit growth. China continues to be a fantastic market both the premium segment as well as the lower price segment. Those lower price segment products we're going to be launching in India, which had very good growth, but albeit at a small market. So I would say within emerging markets, China and India are going to be two areas that we're going to focus very heavily on and that\u2019s from a position of strength. Where we're weaker are in some of the other markets like Russia and Turkey and Brazil and frankly all of Latin America where we've historically had a much lower market share. We were starting to invest and obviously you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happening in those markets. It\u2019s actually not a bad time not to have a huge presence in Russia and Turkey and some of these markets. So we're not going to be hit as hard as some other companies. I think we're going to delay those investments until the market gets a little bit more healthy. Europe, we're obviously really focused on Europe and we're investing. We\u2019ve created a reporting structure that has sales and marketing organizations of Western Europe reporting into our divisions that are based in the U.S. and I think that change is dramatic. It\u2019s going to drive focus. It's going to drive specialization and our market shares in Western Europe are far below where they are in other markets. So Japan to me, this is an anomaly. This is a market that we've historically been very, very strong and same as Australia. It's a very strong market that had another great year in 2014. Challenge is there, you have foreign exchanges working heavily against us and obviously, Bill talked about the magnitude of foreign exchange impact in 2015 but this is not doing complete overhaul of international. We're dialing back in some of the emerging markets, continuing to invest very heavily in China and India, focusing on Western Europe, which I have talked about for the last three years and actually accelerating that impact with this transatlantic model that we're launching. Japan was an unpredicted and it\u2019s a business of our size with the breadth that we have, things sometimes go wrong. So this was a case where we put an ERP system in it. It didn't go well. It uncovered some other problems, which actually changed some of the leadership in Japan to turn around -- things don't always go smoothly. So I wish, I could tell you something, but it's not that the strategy was wrong in Japan. We had these types of strong business in Japan for many, many years. We just hit a speed bump and we have to get back on track. David Roman : Okay. That's our perspective and for Bill, one clarification, I am not sure I heard you correctly. I think you said in your prepared remarks $30 million of net interest per quarter, but that would be materially higher than what you've been running, was that right and if so why? And then secondly on CapEx that $300 million number for 2015, is that the new run rate or is there something specific going on in 2015 that boost that number above the normalized trend? Bill Jellison : Sure, so first on the CapEx side of the equation, we actually stated that even already last year in advance, so it's going into this year. We actually didn't spend that same level. Some of that got carried over already into 2015. We are planning on spending a little bit heavier on an ongoing basis here for a number of reasons as we talked about both reinvesting in some of the IT technology base throughout the organization as well as just covering the faster growth of the organic growth side of our business that we've got and then investing in those businesses around the world. So one, I think that that's relatively consistent. We should be actually spending at a higher CapEx level as we mentioned more consistently moving forward over the next, three, four, five years. If you talk about the interest expense side, we actually were running pretty close to that same similar level throughout most of 2014. There is actually some adjustments for a couple of different things that have taken place within different periods, but that's pretty much what our average run rate has been throughout this year or throughout the 14 year and as we move into '15, it should run at a similar level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Matson : Thanks. Just a question on the hedging program that you're implementing, I am just wondering is this sort of a moving target? In another words, as the currencies keep moving pretty sharply does that sort of push out the point at which you would be fully hedged? Kevin Lobo : No. so the program that we talked about before, the layered hedging as for transactional related hedges and as we mentioned before a hedging program ultimately mitigates or minimizes some of that volatility in the risk in any specific period. It doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk. So if rates went down and stayed down, you're ultimately going to see the impact of those as you continue to move forward. We generally have for our transactional base about six different quarters that are hedged at any point in time and it's a rolling hedge program. So you're in essence getting the average of those six quarters in your transactional related purchases, but we're really getting the full impact each quarter of any other translational side. So as we've earnings in a specific country, each quarter those earnings get translated at whatever the current rates are and so you'll see that level of impact, but our layered hedging is pretty much in place and should continue to be in place as we move forward. Mike Matson : Okay. And then just with the MedSurg business growing so much faster than your other businesses, I was just wondering if you could remind us what the impact -- what impact that has on your gross and operating margins for the company overall? I seem to remember that it has a negative impact on your gross margin, but at the operating line, it's not all that different from the other businesses? Kevin Lobo : Yes, so we've not given specific feedback on any of our divisions or groups, but I think directionally that's absolutely correct. So our margin rates within our broader base MedSurg Group are lower and actually that is one of the negative mixes that we talked about as MedSurg has been obviously growing much quicker than some of our businesses, especially during 2014. And from an overall operating income perspective, all of our businesses perform extremely well within the broader base environment, but some do have slightly lower rates, but just not to the same degree. So in categories like MedSurg while margins would be low -- gross margins would be lower, you would also be having some level of lower expenses to support that maybe our orthopedic group we have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Bruce Nudell : Hi, thanks so much. Kevin could you talk briefly in your view about the importance of cement less knee especially in the younger population, is that going to be enabled by the robot and if you're able to get a cement less knee, does that have intrinsic cost of goods advantages? Kevin Lobo : Yes, so we did launch a cement less knee with a 3D printed to their base plate about a year ago or started to see that perform very, very well and the 3D printing manufacturing enabled a very poor structure, which adheres to the bone very effectively and we launched it very sort of slowly with the limited launch last year. That's gaining steam and as you all know, the cement is used in most keens whereas hips are cement less as it occur in the United States. We do think that's going to be important for the future. The robot will make it even easier, but we already have a product on the market right now that we're trying to push and we're going to push that more aggressively in 2015. But if the robot will enhance that and enable that longer term, then we do believe that, that is going to become a big part of the market. It has obviously taken longer than it has in hips, but that's something that we see of being important in the future. Also for the robot, I think the team pertaining for knee where you keep the ACL intact. I think that could become a very big part of the market. It's obviously tiny today and will take years to play out, it's starting to prove that, but again that's extremely hard procedure and really will not be able to be done very effectively and consistently without the use of a robot. So there is a lot of reasons why we make that on MAKO, it's not just to be able to put in the existing procedures the same way they're being put into today, but also being able to develop these new procedures as you've just outlined. Bruce Nudell : And could you just elaborate a little bit on the transatlantic approach to U.S. and European sales and like just some of the nuts and bolts aspects that you think will be impactful? Kevin Lobo : Yes, so we have let's call it eight divisions and we have a number of business units underneath those divisions. So each one of those divisions is going to have a Vice President and General Manager in Europe that will have their sales and marketing people in all the big countries reporting to them directly. And how that affects the nuts and bolts is in the past we didn't have that business focused on Europe. So you had sales reps selling a wide bag of products that weren\u2019t very focused and the management team when they looked up their organizational chart, they didn't necessarily know that business to the same degree of the specialization and had the same support whether it's marketing materials, training, access to head office. Now that's going to be in a tight organizational alignment and we spent a whole year preparing for this. So during the year, when Europe hit their number this year and really did perform very well, the country managers weren\u2019t sure what their job is going to be? Were they going to be one of these General Managers or going to stay at the country level. So it's been a whole year preparing for this and establishing these eight key roles. In Western Europe, we still have country managers. The one of the mistakes we had made in prior -- in our prior iteration was taking away the prominence of the Country Manager role. We still have that role very much in place. It's a play out and supportive role and to make sure that the things are going well in the country and the key account role with hospitals and with surgeons, but what is going to drive the specialization focus and we've seen in every market where we have specialized sales forces we win. It's a straight formula. It's a truism whether it's in Australia, it's in Canada, obviously the United States and we just never got into that stage in Western Europe and we never get to that stage if you just have the country budgets the old way we did it before. Now that we've emerged those divisions, so the person who is our President of let's call it hips and knees, our Field President of hips and knees, you have a P&L that includes Western Europe and the United States. And when you have that office P&L you have a lot more flexibility with your dollars, because you've bigger marketing budgets, you've bigger R&D budgets, you can move money around and so if you see an exciting opportunity in the U.K. or an exciting opportunity to invest in France, you can balance that against opportunities that exist in the United States and you can move resources more tangibly. It also used to take us -- lot of amount of time to get sort of launches and training aligned between Europe and the United States that will be facilitated. So part of the investment obviously is creating these eight roles. Putting them all in Amsterdam, having a state of the art center in Amsterdam where we can actually train surgeons, these are investments that we just haven't made in Western Europe historically and that's one of the reasons why we've just never moved the dial. We've been trying for 10 plus years and we've changed the leadership multiple times to change the organizational structures within Europe multiple times and we haven't been able to change the dial. So this for us obviously will be a leading Western Europe. He made the first really big improvement over the last two years to get us back on a let's call it market performance or slightly better, but to take the next leap and gain significant market share, this only can be enabled with a dedicated focus across business units. So while out of time, when most companies are leading away from Western Europe, we're leaning in Western Europe and it's just because of our current market share position, which is far below what it is in many other countries in the world. So whether you're excited about it, it's going to take obviously a number of years to play out, but obviously his idea is still involved and he is still the head of Europe and he is fully supportive of this initiative and really believes that we're doing it the right way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Joanne Wuensch : Hi, can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes we can. Katherine Owen : Yes we can. Joanne Wuensch : Terrific. Thank you. We've been talking about capital purchases to be increasing about the level almost since we started talking about the raw material. What you saw in the fourth quarter, do you think that's a sustainable level and do you think it's just sort of a fourth quarter yearend push? Are we finally starting to see more patient call the need for more capital equipment? Katherine Owen : Hi Joanne. I think it's a little tough to know if it's more patient is a function of ACA. We started to see this improvement in the third quarter. Clearly the trend continued into the fourth quarter. Whether hospitals are through the biggest part of their IT investments that they've been making over the last few years or at some manifestation, the increased patients tied to ACA, it's really difficult to get that level of granularity or for just taking market share. What I can tell you is that teams are executing really well and we're seeing a clear strengthening in those businesses that we believe is sustainable and we feel pretty optimistic about the momentum that we're going to have for 2015, but I think it's a little difficult to be able to say it's a function of ACA of increased patient demand without a little bit more time under our belt. Joanne Wuensch : Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up what should we be looking for at AAOS this year? Katherine Owen : Well we have a number of things going on including booth tours and clearly MAKO is going to have a big presence there with all the milestones that we talked about upcoming this year and then we will be highlighting a number of products across the portfolio, not just within reconstructive, but trauma, extremities, the SBI ankle, the additions that we made with PIVOT COALESCE. So there will be a lot of products that's out there, but obviously MAKO does get a lot of attention. Joanne Wuensch : Terrific. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from William Plovanic out of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question. William Plovanic : Great. Thanks. Good evening. I just want to check my math. Looking at the knee business, assuming that you had MAKO, you didn't get much for MAKO in the fourth quarter of '13, I think it seems like the U.S. knee business really slowed down, down maybe 4% to 5% by my math, if you strip out MAKO, may be I am off on that. Just wondering if you could comment on that at all? Kevin Lobo : Yes so, obviously we had a very, very strong fourth quarter last year. It was up 8% and then this year if you strip out MAKO, I think you're little high in your math, but yes, we were slightly down this year. If you exclude the MAKO, we don't obviously parse that out precisely, but yes, we were down slightly, but overall if you look over the two year period, I think, we're still tracking pretty consistently. Again, not everybody has reported yet, but we also didn't benefit and I think there is a temporary benefit if you launch a new product. We saw that with our Accolade II. If you get them priced with the mix advantages for about a one or two year period, we haven't been getting that since our system isn\u2019t a new system to get some of those temporary benefits. But certainly from a customer standpoint, we don't feel reducing really any market share at all and that's been a pretty consistent position that we've had for the last three years. William Plovanic : Okay. And then a follow-up is one of the comments was that there was one less selling day in the quarter. I think that's unique to you and I am just curious, was there actually one less day or was it how vacation sold during the quarter and holidays. I think when you say one less selling days, wondering if you could just quantify that and if it was U.S. only, O.U.S. globally, that's it. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Obviously we have with all the different countries and we do our math within Stryker based on holidays and in last year we had about one extra day in the first, one less day in the second, one extra day in the third, one less day in the fourth and every quarter we called out whether it was an extra day or less a day and then we give you their organic growth. You can see, it's really -- clearly see our organic growth over the full period. The third quarter we also had big, big numbers. We called out one extra day and said we had one extra percent. It's just based on how out calendars are lined up in different parts of the world. In '15 I am very pleased to say that we're not going to have any quarters with extra days or less days. It's not something I enjoy talking about. It's kind of a frustrating thing, but it's just based on the way the calendar was laid out '14 versus '13. Fortunately in '15, the calendar lines up the same as it does in '14. So we won't be talking about this for the next year, but we were pretty transparent, over the full year, there was no difference in days. In 2014, days were the same as '13. It's just the way the holidays fell and we had one extra day in the first, one less in the second, one extra in the third, one less in the fourth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question or comment. Larry Biegelsen : Hey thanks for fitting me in. two clarification questions, one real question. I just wanted to confirm that the first knee that you're going to launch from the MAKO system total knee is going to be Triathlon you mentioned earlier by [Crusher] [ph] retaining knees. Second clarification question, emerging markets grew double-digits, I heard you say earlier, could you give us the exact growth rate on a constant currency basis. Thanks. Katherine Owen : Yes, we're targeting with our 510-K submission to launch the total MAKO with our Triathlon system in 2015. We don't break out the specific emerging market country growth if that was the second part of your question. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. And then for my real question, your Neurotech businesses accelerated this quarter, can you talk about the potential benefit from the MR Clean study, which you mentioned in the past as being important for that and have you seen an impact from that yet, thanks? Katherine Owen : I wouldn't say that we've seen an impact from the MR Clean study. clearly, we're really excited about it and the potential it can have longer term as we start to build the necessary clinical data to help drive adoption to help further educate and position this to the benefit for this treatment of ischemic stroke. But that's going to take time. It's a very positive first step, but there is a lot of market development work that still has to happen including referrals and education and more peer review data, but certainly we're really pleased with it and that group will continue to build on that momentum. Kevin Lobo : Yes we obviously had strong double-digit growth across all of our three Neurotech businesses and neurovascular in particular has been gaining market share for the last couple of years in the hemorrhagic segment and MR Clean would potentially open up the ischemic segment of the market and would build upon an already very strong growing business. So we've been really excited about the Neurotech businesses and both give us access to our new market. It may take some time, but it can certainly grow because as you know there are more ischemic strokes to non-hemorrhagic. So it will take some time in the market. We estimate it's probably about $100 market right now. Could become a market somewhere between the $500 and $1 billion over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann. Please go ahead with your question. Richard, please go ahead, your line is open. Richard Newitter : Hey, sorry. Thanks for taking the question. I had a quick question on the -- so I appreciate that the fourth quarter has a tough comp as it differ us to the industry, from the results referred so far, and your year-over-year growth rate in U.S. knees if your remaining competitors were to report something better and it does appear that you lost share, can you maybe -- first I want to understand why that might be. And then in the first quarter of '15 you should have an easier comp, so all comp adjusted, is there any reason why you shouldn\u2019t be growing a lot in the market once comps are taken out of equation? Katherine Owen : Yes, I would just reiterate the fact that on the knee side, we were up against very tough comps, actually for both hips and knees, the 10% and 8% growth that we talked about with Q4 of '13 being exceptionally strong seasonality effect that we didn't see this year. So the biggest factor where the comps and as Kevin also mentioned, we're not seeing the same mix benefit given the fact that Triathlon is not a new system. We do not believe we're losing market share in volumes and as we go forward, particularly with the anticipated launch of the MAKO total knee, we feel really good about our competitive position. So clearly Q4 had some challenges, Q1 we wouldn't expect the same level fall off given again it wasn\u2019t a strong Q4 seasonality. Weather is a wild card, I can tell you right now there weren\u2019t a lot of surgeries happening in Boston and there won't be happening tomorrow either, but we did have severe weather last year. We're just going to have to wait and see how the rest of the quarter plays out as it relates to the year-over-year comparison from a weather perspective. Richard Newitter : Great. Thanks and just quickly I know you guys have a reverse shoulder and limited launch I think that's correct, can you give us an update on what you see there for the contribution in '15? Kevin Lobo : Yes so the product is performing extremely well. We had a limited launch and we're going to be rolling that out more extensively in 2015. It's obviously a lot of competitors in the market, so I would call it a measured launch and I don't think we will be able to grab the market share as quickly as we had certainly in areas like foot and ankle. But we're looking at sort of a total, the reverse shoulder as well as the upper extremities products that we've acquired through SBI and we're looking at how we want to attack other extremities and we have a couple of pilots planned. I would think by the middle of the year, I would be able to give you a much better idea on how I think the growth profile will be. I think it's still early days for us. As you know, we've been a little bit late in the shoulder market. It's an exciting market. We believe we have very good products now and we're going to start to put that to work. We just want to be careful that we invest the right way and that we get a good return on our investment. Again it's not a new market. This market already exist, but we now feel like we've got a competitive offering, which clearly not the case two, three, four years ago. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Andrew : All right. Good afternoon. I was hoping to get some thoughts on the MAKO performance in the quarter on the run rate basis. Should we look at that placement rate and extend that through '15 as you all roll it out with additional versions of the product and at what point does that become a significant piece of your domestic knee business? Obviously you can't separate the two anymore. But how should we think about that in terms of the timing. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : I am sorry, okay. Okay. I'll take that question, sorry, we're having a audio problem here. So obviously with the launch of the Total Knee and the launch of our Stryker hip products on the robot. The robot is going to start to gain a lot more adoption and then our primary end points are going to also be placed on the robot. So the increased run rate works with the existing products, with the MAKO products. Our plan is to have as many robots as possible all over the country and that all of our end plants will be placed using the robot as many as possible. It's going to take a long, long time for that to happen. So standard instrumentation and standard implants are going to be put in by the majority of surgeons, but our goal is really to increase that run rate, increase the adoption. It's going to be a lot easier for hospitals to afford a robot when they know that they can put other products on it and the implants from a company like Stryker that implants that they know and that they're comfortable with. And so yes, you're going to see it increasingly take up more and more of our business and we shouldn\u2019t think of it as a separate business like separate from our existing core business, that's clearly the strategy and it's going to get messy to analyze through say '15, '16 and then it's really going to become part of our normal business. It's such a disruptive play that frankly predicting exactly the cadence of the robots, we do expect to sell a lot more robots in 2015. There is some seasonality to it. So obviously the first quarter, you shouldn't it to be more than the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter will always be the highest quarter. That's kind of how hospitals buy their capital. We see that with our other MedSurg businesses but we do plan on having a full array of products on the robot, so that the robot will be a lot more meaningful and should consumer much more of our overall volume. Ben Andrew : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question. Joshua Jennings : Hi, thanks a lot. I just wanted to start quickly on the U.S. knee business and one of your competitors has implemented a strategy of selling reconstructive joints direct to U.S. hospitals at a meaningful discount. You didn't call it out as a competitive headwind in the quarter, but was there any impact in 4Q and can you share your thoughts on the potential impact in '15 and beyond in terms of dynamics of the U.S. market? Katherine Owen : Yes, Josh, we have not seen any impact from the -- we're well aware of -- this attempt and it's something that's been tried previously and we didn't see an impact then either and as we look ahead to 2015, it's not something that we were factoring in. Obviously we pay attention and we don't want to just make assumptions, but so far we've seen zero impact from it. Joshua Jennings : Great. And as a quick follow-up on the spine division, we had a few positive pre-announcements from some small cap pure spine players earlier this month. Can you talk about your expectations for the U.S. spine market growth in '15 in terms of acceleration stability or deceleration from '14 levels? And now you've seen 4Q results and are you comfortable with the strategy in play for Stryker to regain share and accelerate growth in that specific unit? Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Yes, so certainly the spine market has gone through a lot price challenges over the past four, five years, but innovation has been rewarded. I think the market is trying to turn and we're seeing a positive trend in the market overall. We're really excited about our spine business. Obviously we had some challenges at the beginning of this year and overall the results certainly from a profit standpoint were solid. Sales standpoint were not fantastic but I'm very excited about 2015. The CoAlign acquisition is a fabulous product. We've also launched some other memory invasive products in a lot of areas that have been a little bit weak for us. We have a new R&D leader that started over a year ago that has really nice looking pipeline. We have a new general manager, a new head of marketing. So the management team that we have at Spine is fantastic. I went to the spine meeting -- sales meeting earlier this year. I can say the momentum there is better than it's been in many, many years because they have a nice flow of innovative products that you can still gain good price and growth with as we've seen with some of the spine-only companies. So I think we're in much better position now than we have been over the past couple of years in spine. In fact the market is trying to look better. So it's a space I am excited about. We have a team in offence that should enjoy significant success in 2015 and the years ahead. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just one quick follow-up or not even a follow-up, just one clarifying question, on the R&D side, I know you don't guide line item guidance on things like R&D but in the last few years kind of growing R&D 2X the rate of sales have done faster, is that how we should think about the company going forward here over the next few years. We think that maybe some of the MAKO investments start to drop off, maybe some of the Neurotec studies in clinical trial cost start to fall off, but I would like to hear maybe if R&D should keep growing at that rate going forward? Bill Jellison : Yes Jeff, this is Bill. So as far as R&D is concerned, as you know we've increased our overall R&D spend as a percent of sales throughout this year. In fact the whole year ended up about 40 basis points higher kind of north of 6% and I think that you should expect that it's probably in that kind of slightly north of 6% range moving forward. I say it's going to be more consistently growing kind of at our broader base sales level, maybe slightly faster, but not at the level that you saw in 2014 as far as from a growth perspective, but as a percent of sales perspective that's probably reasonable. Jeff Johnson : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2015 results will be held on April 21, thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Baird William Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity Operator : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lakiba and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during the conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stryker\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide several updates, including MAKO. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers. Our first quarter results continue to reflect the strength of our sales and marketing teams, our diversified businesses and the payoff we are realizing from our investments in innovation. We had another strong quarter of organic sales growth of nearly 6% and EPS topped a high-end of our projected range for the quarter. Trauma and Extremities, Sports Medicine, Interventional Spine and our Neurotechnology franchises all continued their momentum from last year with excellent growth. Our medical business also had an outstanding quarter, marking three successive quarters of stellar performance. And our U.S. Hip business helped to fuel the strength in Orthopedics. We are pleased with the continued progress on MAKO, which was a highlight of the recent American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Meeting. And we continue to have a high level of conviction regarding the long-term potential for robotics in orthopedics. We are encouraged with launch of our transatlantic operating model, as Europe posted another good quarter of growth and with strength in divisional leadership is set up for accelerated gains in the years ahead. As a reminder, we have used some of the benefits of our lower tax rate to invest in Europe SG&A. Growth within the emerging markets was solid again, as was our performance in Australia. Like any quarter, we had some challenges, including U.S. supply disruptions, which adversely impacted revenue for both Instruments and MAKO implants. The MAKO issues will be resolved in Q2, while the Instruments situation will linger into Q3. Despite these challenges, both businesses managed to post positive growth in the quarter. In both cases, we see delayed sales and no material loss of revenue for the full year. Japan is on an improving trajectory and we expect this trend to continue as we move through the year. Growth from our recent acquisitions was also modestly below our expectation in the first quarter, but our teams are excited about the future of these businesses as they work through early integration. Foreign exchange was a negative impact, in line with our Q1 expectations. And if rates remain at current levels, we will generally be in line with the full year guidance communicated in January. We have also repurchased $280 million of our stock year-to-date, $130 million of which occurred during Q1. In sum, we are off to a strong start for 2015, with top line strength across our three business segments and balanced globally. We are driving earnings results with disciplined expense management, while continuing to invest in R&D to ensure long-term revenue growth. Our solid balance sheet and cash flow generation remains a key characteristic of Stryker and positions us well as we continue to look for the best ways to invest in our future. As an organization, we are focused on consistently delivering on our targets as we strive to optimize shareholder returns. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on MAKO, progress with our Transatlantic Operating Model or TOM as well as some comments on the recent clinical studies regarding acute ischemic stroke. With respect to MAKO, we are pleased with the continued progress we are seeing following the integration of this business during 2014. In the first quarter, we placed nine robots versus two in the year ago quarter, with the placements representing a nice balance between existing Stryker customers and competitive accounts. We did have some challenges with our MAKO knee implants going to a temporary product supply disruption during the quarter, the impact of which will be fully resolved during Q2. Adjusting for this, our U.S. Knee growth would have been modestly higher. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the strength of the pipeline, which reinforces our conviction in the growing interest in robotics. And with sales force integration complete and new robotic indications now cleared, we are well positioned for 2015 and beyond. With respect to the latter, our Stryker Power Hip brand, including Accolade are now compatible with the MAKO hip application. Additionally, our X3 polyethylene bearings have also been cleared for use with the MAKO Uni implants. Our Total Knee 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA late last year and we are continuing the dialogue with the agency. Turning to TOM which went live at the beginning of the year, this initiative will enable us to drive a multi-year improvement in our growth profile in Western Europe. The structure is fully operational, with eight transatlantic division Presidents now having full P&L responsibility for the combined U.S. and Europe businesses. They each have a General Manager, all based at our regional headquarters in Amsterdam with direct responsibility for sales and marketing in Western Europe. The RHQ represents a flagship for our presence in Europe as we bring in HCPs into the site for training and education on our Stryker products. We believe this will be key to strengthening the Stryker brand in Europe and enhancing our relationship with physicians and hospitals. As we discussed approximately half our lower tax savings is being reinvested into our European business in terms of additional sales and marketing headcount and support to help further accelerate growth. Lastly, over the past four months, an impressive amount of strong clinical data had been released supporting the use of device-based treatment of acute ischemic stroke. From the acquisition of Concentric, we have pioneered this space in our unique and differentiated products. Trevo represented the majority of the products used in the pivotal MR CLEAN study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January. We expect the market will take time to evolve, which will require the automation of EMS transport and inter-hospital transfers, establishment of clinical guidelines, position incentives and investment in new human and physical capital to absorb new patient volume. Clearly as the data comes out, it reinforces our excitement from the ischemic stroke market and its longer term revenue potential. We believe we are well positioned and we will continue to invest in this therapy through further product development, the funding of next generation trials and supporting the full continuum of care for stroke. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Bill Jellison : Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 3.2% in the first quarter including a negative 4.2% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7.4%, which includes organic growth of 5.6%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the first quarter were $0.58 per share versus $0.18 per share last year in the first quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.11 per share for the quarter versus $1.06 per share in the first quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.08 per share from FX. Foreign exchange rates were very volatile again during the first quarter with the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, euro, Swiss franc and many other currencies weakening against the dollar. The weakening of the Swiss franc and our layered hedging program helped to mitigate the additional weakening of other currencies that occurred within the quarter. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relates to charge \u2013 a charge of approximately $54 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II and an additional tax expense associated with the transfer of intellectual property to the Netherlands from some of our other European locations. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. Looking at sales in the first quarter, our organic growth of 5.6% was comprised of a positive 7.1% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.6%. Acquisitions added 1.9%, while FX had a negative 4.2% impact on the sales in the quarter. Looking at our segments, Orthopedics represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopedic Products were up 2.4% as reported and grew 7.5% at constant currency and increased 6.5% organically. U.S. Orthopedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities once again had another standout quarter, with sales in the U.S. increasing 18% and 11% in international markets in constant currency, with over 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business or roughly 20%, excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have great success with our product offerings in this expanding market. U.S. Hips continued its strong performance and grew 7.5% in the first quarter, while U.S. Knees increased 2.4%. Internationally, sales were down 1.3% in Hips in constant currency and increased 4.5% in Knees in constant currency. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 4.6% as reported, with 7.7% in constant currency and increased 4.3% organically. These results were led by double-digit organic and constant currency growth in our medical business as our sales force, combined with a strong product offering, continue to execute in an improving capital equipment market. We also experienced mid to upper single-digit constant currency growth in Instruments, Endoscopy and Sustainability. Our Instruments business was negatively impacted in the first quarter and will also be negatively impacted in the second quarter by product supply issue at one of our suppliers. We believe Instruments organic growth for the quarter would have run at least in the upper single-digits if supply was fully available. This issue was expected to be resolved by early in the third quarter and should have modest impact on Instruments full year results. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 18% of our sales in the quarter, increased 2.1% as reported and 6.6% in constant currency and 6% organically. Growth in this segment was led by double-digit growth in our Neurotechnology businesses and IBS, while spinal implant sales increased slightly in the quarter. And looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2015 were 65.6%, relatively flat with the back half of 2014 and compares to 66.6% in the first quarter last year. Gross profit includes a re-class of expenses in all periods of approximately 30 basis points, which came out of SG&A for consistency. The decline in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year predominantly resulted from negative pricing pressures and negative mix related to our recent acquisitions. Pricing was down 1.6% in the quarter, better than last quarter and last year, which both ran approximately 2%. Pricing pressure remains challenging and we still expect pricing to be down nearly 2% for the company moving forward. Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales, relatively flat compared to last year in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $854 million or 35.9% of sales in the quarter versus 36% in the prior year period, despite reinvestments to strengthen our European selling and regional headquarter activities. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.3% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 24.1% in the first quarter of 2014. The rate was negatively impacted by pricing, FX and the mix of recent acquisitions, along with activities to support our European business. These impacts were partially offset by operating improvements in the period. Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $28 million compared to $24 million last year in the first quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense in the period. Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 40.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.5%. This compares to a 24.1% adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended up the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also have $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended in the first quarter at 58, slightly above last year\u2019s first quarter. And days and inventory finished the quarter at 173, just a little bit better than the 174 days in the first quarter of last year. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first quarter of 2015 were $380 million compared to $209 million last year in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $70 million in 2014. However, capital expenditures are expected to run higher than last year as we move through 2015. We also repatriated approximately $700 million in the first quarter and expect to do approximately an additional $1 billion later this year. We now have over $2.3 billion available for share repurchase under our recently expanded authorization as approximately $280 million of share repurchases were made so far in 2015, with $130 million of that repurchased by the end of the first quarter. We will continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next 2 to 3 years. Based on our solid first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year, we are well positioned to deliver on our full year sales and earnings guidance. And we are now increasing the lower end of our guidance for both sales and earnings for 2015. Our sales guidance now includes constant currency growth of 6% to 7%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, with the second quarter sales projected to be impacted the most and slightly over that range. Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be nearly 2% for the company moving forward, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced over the last year. The benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year end earnings guidance and represents approximately $0.05 per share for the year. We continue to expect that they will once again be approved. However, we do not expect them renewed until late in the year. As such, we do not have any benefit from them in our actual results or our planned earnings guidance until the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect that our adjusted tax rate will run at or below the level achieved in the first quarter and will be noticeably better when the benefits from the tax extenders are approved. As mentioned previously, we plan on reinvesting approximately half of our tax savings associated with the European regional tax \u2013 regional headquarters. These additional investments are supporting our new structure within Europe and will also supplement our selling and marketing activities. Based on current FX rates, we expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share for the full year, with approximately half of that occurring in the first half of the year. The further weakening of the euro and most other currencies since our original guidance, along with our hedging program has not resulted in an additional FX impact on us as the Swiss franc has also significantly weakened in that period. That weakening along with the euro makes all of our European produced products less expensive and combined with our layered hedges has fully offset the additional translational impact which occurred. Keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rates movements is largely driven by the translational component of FX, which we do not hedge. And finally, we have heightened the lower end of our earnings guidance for 2015, with adjusted net earnings per share now in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.20 for the second quarter of 2015. Thanks again for your support and we would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : Thank you. We would now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is going to come from Rick Wise out of Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Good afternoon. Can you hear me clearly? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Rick Wise : Great. If I could start off with a question on acquisitions, you highlighted that acquisitions were somewhat below expectations can you help us understand a little more detail which were below plan, why and just what the drag on growth and how it all gets resolved? Katherine Owen : Yes. Hi, Rick. It really is the recent deals because \u2013 as they pass the 1-year mark, they have become part of organic growth. And nothing that we would call out beyond some of the early normal integration challenges. It\u2019s primarily around the Berchtold acquisition, which we anniversary in the second quarter and within our endoscopy segment. We feel really good about the pipeline and the visibility we have for that revenue to improve as the year unfolds, but it really is just the normal integration, early challenges we have when we bring a new business in. Rick Wise : Yes, thanks. And just as a follow-up on MAKO, Katherine can you give just a little more color on the MAKO performance this quarter, was this as you expected and is this how we think about the quarterly run rate going ahead with obviously fourth quarter because of the capital spending always being a little stronger? Thanks. Katherine Owen : We are certainly pleased with the increase in year-over-year placements going from two to nine and that it was balanced between existing customers, but also competitive accounts. Clearly, there is a seasonality component to this given the significant capital piece of Q4 to Q1. You are always going to see that drop off. But I would say it was essentially in line with what we were targeting, recognizing we did have some supply disruptions on the knee side that the impact from that was relatively modest. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Katherine Owen : Hi Bob. Kevin Lobo : Hello Bob. Operator : Bob, if your line is on mute, please un-mute it. Okay. Our next question is going to come from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hi, I guess you guys can hear me, right. Kevin Lobo : Yes we can. Katherine Owen : Thanks Kristen. Kristen Stewart : Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the re-class was exactly. And then just on the tax rate, it seems like based on your commentary you would expect the tax rate to be a little bit lower than perhaps what you had previously had commented, I just want to make sure that I was hearing about that correctly? Kevin Lobo : Sure. So the re-class is really just for consistency. It\u2019s really one of our groups were classifying some of the expenses the same way. So it\u2019s a re-class of some of the freight costs that are coming out of the SG&A category and going into COGS and it\u2019s about 30 basis points, pretty much on average for this year. But all of the restatements will be reflected in the financials in both periods. As far as the tax rate, yes we stated early on in the year that we were expecting at least two full percentage points of improvement off of last year\u2019s rate. I think that we feel very good about kind of one, where the rate came out for the quarter and are pleased with realizing kind of the benefit associated with that. And as we mentioned, we do believe that that rate is sustainable throughout this year. And then also keep in mind, in the fourth quarter when the tax extenders, if they do get approved at $0.05 a share that will affect it by about another full percentage point. Kristen Stewart : Okay. So we should be thinking, instead of a rate of close to around I guess 200 basis points lower certainly something greater than that? Bill Jellison : Yes. In total greater than 200 basis points, yes that\u2019s correct. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Thanks, Kristen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein : Thank you. So first question I guess it\u2019s all really guidance questions. First question is the underlying growth actually came in probably a tad below industry where the street for that, obviously very good quarter, so it\u2019s very Stryker-like in terms of the breadth, but you are raising the kind of organic and constant currency guidance for the year, so maybe just touch on what\u2019s driving the increase, given what was a good quarter but not one of your blowout quarters? Kevin Lobo : Well, Mike, this is Kevin. I would tell you, we feel very good about the quarter and certainly the outlook for the rest of the year. All of our businesses are performing well by segment, by geography and we even had a challenge within instruments, which is one of our largest divisions that had a supply issue that will get rectified. Obviously, MAKO implants was the more modest, but even that had supplies. So, we fought through some supply challenges, still delivered almost 6% organic growth and feel very good about the position that we are in right now. The expenses are well under control. You heard about bill on the tax rate. So we really have all of our engines firing. And we are feeling very positive as we look through the rest of the year and that\u2019s why we felt confident in raising the lower end of both sales and earnings. Mike Weinstein : Okay. And then on the earnings piece, making sure I have got all the moving parts. So it sounds like the answer to Kristen\u2019s questions on the tax rate is that the tax rate for the year instead of being 20% may end up being closer to 19%, I just want to double check on that. And then the FX thing obviously surprised us because the dollar has gotten over the course of the last 3 months since your last call, on the fourth quarter you guided to $0.30 of impact for the year and now you are saying $0.25 to $0.30, so that\u2019s just the function of basically the Swiss manufacturing and the interchange between the euro, the dollar getting stronger versus euro, but the Swiss franc weakening at the same time? Bill Jellison : Yes. So, both of those questions, on the tax side of the equation, yes we do expect the rate to be lower than the 20% that we talked about. So at least, two if not obviously closer to three which is more in line with kind of where that first quarter is and especially if you add extenders in there, we should absolutely be able to deliver on that \u2013 on the tax aspect piece for the entire year. As far as FX is concerned, you are absolutely right. FX rate definitely weakened further against the U.S. dollar for most currencies. And fortunately, the Swiss also weakened along with it. And if you recall, the Swiss franc actually strengthened when it decoupled away from the euro at the beginning of this year, which actually caused our FX exposure to increase just prior to our guidance for the \u2013 at the beginning of the year. So based on that weakening of the Swiss along with the euro and the hedges that we currently have in place, we believe that we are fully offsetting at least the additional impact of the translational side that\u2019s occurred since our original guidance. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. I will let some others jump in. Thank you, guys. Kevin Lobo : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I wanted to just start on capital deployment, obviously you made the comments around the share repurchase activity that took place both year-to-date and in the first quarter, could you maybe just talk \u2013 and then I think, Bill you also provided some context as to the timing of when you expected to use the authorization, could you maybe just talk about what were the factors influencing your decision to buyback stock, I think it\u2019s in several quarters since you bought back this type of \u2013 this type of stock and whether we should think about this as a change in the capital deployment priority scheme or just how it fits into the broader strategy? Katherine Owen : Yes. I would \u2013 David I would view it as very much consistent with the capital allocation strategy we have tried to articulate. We still view M&A as the primary use with the dedicated BD folks in all of our divisions who are actively looking at targets. We also have with the cash flow, the ability to do buybacks as well as the dividend. And so there is no change. We did increase the authorization. It gives us the flexibility. And we expect to use it over the next 2 to 3 years. I couldn\u2019t predict in any given quarter we will be at these same levels. We usually have an assumption of around $400 million of share repurchases in any given year. This year could be higher than that. It just will depend on how the year plays out, other potential uses of cash and also recognizing the constraints that we along with many others have given where the bulk of our cash is generated being outside the U.S. So, no change whatsoever to the capital allocation strategy. And we are in the \u2013 we have the ability to continue to pursue multiple avenues. David Roman : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the P&L, Bill, I think in your description of the gross margin for the quarter, you talked about it being essentially flat with the second half of 2014. Are we \u2013 is that commentary meant to reflect a view that we are sort of coming to an end of the gross margin declines in some of the headwinds that you have sort of soaked up here, whether it\u2019s mix from acquisitions or price or FX are starting to abate in some of the factors here like mix, for example, could actually turn into a headwind as things like your neuro and spine business start to do better or am I reading too much into that? Bill Jellison : No, I think that, that\u2019s at least a fair comment. I think as we \u2013 as you look toward kind of the back end of this year, the remaining part of the year, I think you should expect that our gross margin rate differences on a year-over-year basis should be much narrower than what you have seen over the last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Kevin, just want to come back to where we left off at AOS. I think we and many investors sort of took some of your comments at AOS to be particularly bullish for the outlook for Stryker. And I think certainly your guidance implies acceleration in the back half of the year, but we sort of took your commentary at the academy meeting to be more about years to come, specifically 2016. So, as you think about 2016 and the potential for driving faster growth at Stryker, what are the few things you would point us to which gives you that kind of conviction as we head out into the out years? Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks, David. I would say the first thing I would point to is MAKO. As you can see the kind of momentum we have already started to build with 20 robots in Q4, 9 this quarter, a number of our implants getting approved on the robot increased level of interest. And so I would see MAKO as one growth accelerator. Second, I would see the acute ischemic stroke as another area that with all the great data that\u2019s coming out would be another engine. Now, that might take a little bit more than \u201816, but it should certainly start to ramp in \u201816. Our transatlantic operating model, we are very pleased about the upside that, that has. Not so much in the implant side, but certainly, if you look at MedSurg and even parts of Neurotechnology, we have a lot of room to grow our market share and we are very pleased with the start. It\u2019s early \u2013 only one quarter since it\u2019s gone live, but had a very strong quarter and I would see that also accelerating in 2016. So, a number of those levers and then the acquisitions that we have done, we have done a number of, I guess, 6 over the past \u2013 just over a year of bolt-ons. And those bolt-on acquisitions, whether it\u2019s CoAlign, Pivot, Berchtold, all of those go through sort of early integration issues. And then those will start to accelerate. So, I really am excited about the prospects. 2015 will be a solid year. And I think 2016 could set up to be an even better one. David Lewis : Great. And just a quick follow-up on capital deployment, Kevin, there has been a dramatic amount of focus on what you are going to acquire in these last 6 months. Shifting away from what you are going to acquire to the class of thing that you are looking at. There seems to be at least in our view a lot of focus from investors on purchasing for accretion and it takes you some pressure if there is any multiple and really driving accretion. Do you feel that type of pressure? Does the board feel that type of pressure? And where does Stryker come out right now in terms of your preference versus acquisitions for growth versus acquisitions that could be growth or growth and accretion? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : So, maybe I will take the first part and then ask Bill to chime in, since Bill obviously, the finance group has a big say in terms of making sure we are creating value over the long-term, but we really look to strengthen our businesses and we are looking to do acquisitions. We want to strengthen our market position in the areas where we are playing today and that could be big deals, small deals or medium sized deals, but we want to make sure we are strengthening our position and encouraging our divisions to continue to drive growth. So, most of the acquisitions that we pursue and you have seen this are catalysts for growth and we tend to plug those into existing divisions and then drive accelerated growth. But we are disciplined in terms of the deals that we look at and the price that we paid for deals. Clearly, in the case of a MAKO, that was a disruptive deal, which is a little bit out of the ordinary. But all the other deals go through very rigorous screening to make sure that we are paying the right price and that will create value. Maybe I will turn to Bill in terms of the parameters that we look at when evaluating our acquisitions. Bill Jellison : Sure. So, I would say that we are all very aware of also the need for accretion in the earnings as we do acquisitions. But as we have talked about before, whether we have done maybe some non-accretive deals in the past or not, I think each deal that we look at is really looked at from the standpoint that we think that it ultimately creates value for the company over the mid and long-term as well. And would we be looking or would be willing to still look at an acquisition that necessarily doesn\u2019t or that doesn\u2019t necessarily have accretion in the first year or so? We would. It\u2019s all about whether it ultimately adds value on the back end in an earlier stage business, which we think has much higher growth for the organization than even our base level, we would absolutely make that investment \u2013 another investment like that today. But all of our acquisitions are based on the value that we think we can ultimately create for the shareholders, but we aren\u2019t restricted on just accretion as one aspect of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask one, I guess, on your repurchase change here. So, you did talk about kind of a normal level of $400 million on this call and past calls. And if you just do the 2 to 3 years for the $2.3 billion, obviously, that\u2019s a higher number. So, are you saying that you are just leaning more towards your purchase here, because you don\u2019t have the same kind of M&A pipeline or things aren\u2019t hitting your targets or you are not trying to change your staff at all, I guess I am just a little confused and want to clarify? Katherine Owen : Yes, no change in the staff in terms of BD being a priority and then folks as I mentioned out there are actively looking at targets. We have upped the authorization, because we feel we have the flexibility if we decide M&A is inherently unpredictable. So, we wanted to have the flexibility to potentially purchase a greater level. $400 million isn\u2019t exact number it\u2019s a rough number walking around. It could be higher than that this year and obviously to use up the entire amount over 2 to 3 years, we have to increase the level. So, if it\u2019s done in 2 years, we have obviously accelerated the share repurchases and some of that will depend on whether or not BD targets make it through to fruition. As you know, the vast majority of names we look at never translate into an actual deal. Matt Taylor : And then your pricing actually got a little bit better, I guess sequentially looking at the price decline year-over-year. Are you seeing any major changes in price? I mean, there has been some concerns I have seen with investors around value-based purchasing, but maybe too early to call that as a negative factor? Katherine Owen : Yes. Pricing has gotten, well, obviously, negative, modestly better over the last few quarters and that\u2019s nice to see, but it\u2019s still in that approximate range of around 2%. It moved around quarter-to-quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t view the 1.6 as some \u2013 indicative of some big change in the pricing environment. It\u2019s still challenging. We still assume it\u2019s around 2. It will be great if it\u2019s less than 2, but there is no change to our current thinking. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Katherine Owen : Hey, Bob. Kevin Lobo : Bob, are you there? Operator : Mr. Hopkins, your line is open. Katherine Owen : Okay. Maybe the third time will be the charm with Bob. Operator : Okay. Okay, I will have him re-queue back up. Our next question is going to come from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Mike Matson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I had one on MAKO and then one on the Neurotechnology business. So, just on MAKO, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the hip side of that business and how big of a deal do you think it is to have the Stryker hip family now available on the RIO system? And then just on the Neurotechnology business, I understand the commentary around the standard Trevo product, but how fast \u2013 sorry, have you seen any impact yet, just given the strength of the data that\u2019s come out of those recent studies? And how fast do you think the market is growing neurovascular overall? And do you think Stryker has been gaining share? Katherine Owen : So, on MAKO, clearly having the Stryker power brand, particularly Accolade, which has been very successful on the MAKO robot, we think it\u2019s going to help increase the value proposition at particularly given the small clinical data, we still believe total knee is the biggest market opportunity overall, but we do think we can strengthen the interest level and momentum on the hip side as we add our proven clinical hip line to that products. On neuro, it\u2019s going to take time with the market development. We have seen an increase in volumes in some of established stroke centers but the majority still need to work through a lot of the items that we listed off on the call around being able to have physician alignment, inter-hospital transfers and really making sure they are established as a stroke center and that\u2019s going to take time. So it\u2019s really focused on the longer term potential as well as some additional clinical trials that are underway including DAWN and the SITS Open trial, but those are probably not going to be completed in 2016 or even 2017. So we are building the base of data. MR CLEAN is a great study. I think it reinforces our conviction, but it will take time overall. In terms of the market, if you are talking about the ischemic segment, it\u2019s very healthy growth. But remember the base is still very small here for the device-based treatment of that condition. So while it\u2019s double-digit growth, it\u2019s off of a pretty small base. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And I think one of the questions you asked was neurovascular in general I would say that the bulk of the business is really on the hemorrhagic side as you know. And we have consistently been taking market share over the past 2 years or 3 years with a slew of different product introductions around our target brand, different sizes, different shapes and that product continues to perform extremely well around the world. Mike Matson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : I am so sorry about the phone difficulties, I apologize. Katherine Owen : We just have really big expectations for this question now Bob. Bob Hopkins : Yes. I am afraid I am not up to the task. So two quick things, first, on the spine side, Kevin at the recent AAOS meeting, obviously this is one of areas where you have expressed a lot of excitement about the portfolio, about the sales force and about the products you have coming down the pike, I was wondering if you could just kind of set them expectations as we look forward as to when you think we could really start to see some noticeable acceleration in the spine business, is that something that you can do organically here over the next couple of quarters or do you think it\u2019s going to take longer? Kevin Lobo : Well, as I mentioned before, I am really pleased with our spine business. Certainly, we have a very profitable business. And we have been improving our organic profile. The CoAlign acquisition was a very important one, are providing very innovative products. We have strengthened our management team at spine. And so this first quarter was, I would say a good quarter. I think we are going to start to improve over the course of 2015 and also continue to look at other opportunities to add products, whether it\u2019s through organic or inorganic means over time. But it\u2019s a business that\u2019s going well. The management is in really good shape and I expect this to be a better year than we have seen in the last couple of years. Bob Hopkins : Okay. And then lastly I apologize if this was asked Katherine, but did you guys spell out explicitly what sort of buyback is assumed in your guidance for this year, just I think, originally you had said it was just sort of the normal $400 million when you first gave guidance, I am sorry if I missed this, but I just was curious exactly how much buyback is assumed in this new guidance? Katherine Owen : Yes. So what we say is at the start of any year we assume some level of buyback activity. And there is a lot of different things that factor into a range, obviously. So we say $400 million, but that could be plus or minus $100 million. And you have seen some years it\u2019s not that and some years it could be higher than that. I think with the open authorization increase, we clearly have the ability to buyback more stock. We haven\u2019t made any explicit changes that you should be assuming a new level because really it\u2019s going to depend on other priorities and how big year unfolds. And it is again why we have a range of $0.15 range and obviously everything else being equal, which won\u2019t be true but everything else being equal, we buyback more stock. It\u2019s going have a positive impact there. But there is no explicit assumption at this point. Bob Hopkins : Okay. So there is no explicit incremental assumption in these new numbers, it\u2019s sort of the same as it was at the beginning of year just by the authorization? Katherine Owen : Yes. And we think we will use that up over 2 years to 3 years, which, obviously a bit \u2013 it\u2019s a bit lower end of that we are going to have a higher level and hopefully that will translate into a better performance within the range. But there is a lot of factors in that range as you know that can offset things pretty quickly. Bob Hopkins : Great. Okay, thank you very much. Kevin Lobo : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good afternoon guys. I had a question on recon pricing, in the press release you called out recon pricing down 3% and I was wondering how is that comparing to your plan, and if you can give us any color on U.S. recon pricing whether it\u2019s above or below the 3% you have in the press release? Thanks. Katherine Owen : Thanks Glenn. We breakout pricing on a worldwide basis for the three business segments and you can see that in the press release. We don\u2019t break it down further by geography. Clearly, the greatest pricing pressure is within the Ortho segment at that 3% level. No real change from quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s all the same trends we have seen \u2013 we have been seeing. I mean pricing got incrementally better for us, but still negative, but I wouldn\u2019t point to any significant change in any of the business segments that would be worth highlighting as it relates to price. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, once again U.S. foot and ankle, better than 30%, I don\u2019t know how many more quarters you have left and you would keep doing 30%, but maybe talk about the sustainability of that number and in the end markets, I know the end markets can support that, but how much longer can 30% last? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Well, thanks. First of all, just to clarify, so if the greater than 30% growth was aided by the acquisition of SBI. So, on an organic basis, we grew around 20, still a very, very impressive number, given the multiple quarters of organic growth that had exceeded 30%. But we are really excited about the potential, we are still penetrating and new markets are very exciting because they are hard to predict. You don\u2019t really know and as you are continuing to penetrate the market where more and more implants are being used. Getting a total ankle, it was a huge move for us. In the foot and ankle market, it was a good gap that acquisition is really just starting to gain steam. So we still think we have plenty of growth ahead for our foot and ankle division. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Some hospitals are reporting better volume in the first quarter of 2015, is that partly what drove the improvement in your Ortho numbers in Q1 and your U.S. hip number was very strong, are you already seeing the benefit from the Stryker Power brand on the MAKO robot? Katherine Owen : I would say we haven\u2019t seen any real change in volumes in the first quarter beyond the normal seasonality that we see. So nothing that has changed dramatically there. And I think it\u2019s too early given when we got the clearance of the MAKO of the Stryker Power brands on MAKO to point to that. As you have seen we have had really good momentum there for a while and I think it\u2019s just the strength of the overall portfolio. Kevin Lobo : Yes. In the U.S. our hip brands have been growing above market for about 3 years now. So this is a continuation of the strength that we have had over time. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. And then that\u2019s my follow-up. I guess I am wondering if you are seeing anything so far from the Zimmer-Biomet merger or from Wright-Tornier, anything in terms of disruption? Thanks for taking the question. Katherine Owen : Yes. Nothing that we would point to, although it\u2019s too early with \u2013 the deals haven\u2019t closed and you typically see that disruption occur later in the integration process. And whether or not that translates into any shares shifts, we are not assuming that. I think we are really well positioned between our portfolio and the MAKO line and the underlying strength that we are seeing in foot and ankle. But I wouldn\u2019t point to any disruption that we are seeing of any significance at this time. Kevin Lobo : Yes. It\u2019s too early and certainly if there is disruption, we will be well positioned to take advantage of it. But at this point, it\u2019s too early to see anything. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good afternoon. Wondering if I could ask a bit on MAKO, as you get closer to launching that product, the total knee on \u2013 the product in the United States, I am curious if there is anything you can share with us in terms of how you will position that product, what the attributes will be that you will stress the customers, whether it\u2019s better alignment or better efficiencies or just anything that can support the rollout of that product? Katherine Owen : Really the overall value proposition of MAKO hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s built on improved patient benefits and clinical outcomes. And we think we are going to be uniquely enabled to be able to show procedural enhancements and improve patient experience and then improve patient satisfaction. We think with this technology the consistency and reproducibility of the surgery is really going to elevate and allow for greater standardization and better overall outcomes. And then longer term, hopefully next generation of implants that regardless of surgeon\u2019s skill is simply not achievable today with traditional planar cuts. Raj Denhoy : Okay. When asked about kind of the products you are most excited about, I think you highlighted MAKO is the biggest one. And I am not sure if you have ever given us anything in terms of your expectations about what share you could gain or what the product could actually do for your position in the marketplace. Have you \u2013 are you ready to do that or give us anything in terms of expectations? Katherine Owen : No, we haven\u2019t and it\u2019s early, obviously, we don\u2019t have the total knee and that\u2019s going to take time even when it gets approval, it\u2019s going to be a methodical and measured ramp up as we train and educate. Clearly, MAKO is something we are very excited about. The ortho team is very excited about it. But if you really look at the history of Stryker, with all the different businesses and franchises we have, all rolling our products, it\u2019s much more story about singles and doubles and the totality of all those products that drive the organic sales growth. It\u2019s very rarely any one single product that we would point to. And while MAKO has the potential obviously to be a big driver, overall, it\u2019s the totality of that portfolio. Raj Denhoy : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on Raj\u2019s question here previously. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about the total knee rollout? I mean, we are getting fairly close I think here to getting that approval. So, once you do get the approval, how do you go out to the hospitals that already have an existing system? Is there an upgrade program that we should expect? I think the installed base is right around 250. And then are you hearing from hospitals at this point right now that are already waiting to see the total knee application before buying the system? And then I have a follow-up. Katherine Owen : Yes, I think again it\u2019s going to be a very measured launch post-approval. And we are still I mean we filed with the FDA stage and then when we get the clearance, we are going to have to be very measured, we are going to have to train and educate to make sure that surgeon experience is appropriate. We don\u2019t want to mess this up. There is going to be upgrades that have to happen from a software standpoint. So, it is something as we have articulated in the past, it\u2019s going to be a number of quarters before we start to really see the trajectory that\u2019s indicative of us taking market share gains. And nothing has changed with that expectation. What we saw in our due diligence is a range of people. There is the early adopter with any new technology. There is those who want to see more of an established clinical brand of implants and that\u2019s what we are doing as we add the hip power brands, for example. And then there is those who want to wait and see more indications. So, I am sure there are surgeons out there who want a total knee before they really are going to be convinced to go the robotic route. And that\u2019s just indicative of the various ways of technology adopters you see both with the robot or any new technology. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Fair enough. And then for my follow-up question, the Trauma and Extremities business continues to be quite healthy, that selectively is around a $7 billion category growing mid to upper single-digits. And I think your sales force is pretty established here. You have a full portfolio of products in both areas. Is this some \u2013 is this a category where over the next kind of 5 to 7 years you could essentially double your revenue base here? Katherine Owen : So, your market estimates on a global basis for Trauma and Extremities are ballpark. And we are really pleased with the performance we are doing there. I don\u2019t think we want to get into that type of multiyear projections in terms of the revenue potential. But clearly, we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing, the ability to consistently take market share. And we think that\u2019s going to remain the case going forward. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I would see this as we see with Neurotechnology, Sports Medicine, Trauma and Extremities, these are really growth businesses for Stryker, and they have been for multiple quarters. And I think in the years ahead, we are going to continue to focus on them. If you think about upper extremities, we are still a relatively small player in upper extremities. And for us, that\u2019s an exciting area for the next few years. There are established players. It\u2019s not like foot and ankle, which is a brand new market. But for us, there is plenty of room to grow in the upper extremities space and even with some of the products we acquired through the SBI acquisitions, we think we are well-positioned there. So, for us, it\u2019s definitely has been a great business for the past multiple years and we continue to see that as an exciting growth business in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Kaila Krum : Hi, guys. This is Kaila in for Ben. Just back to the MAKO commentary and understanding the seasonality of the business, but recognizing the pretty steep sequential step-downs from the fourth quarter, can you just talk about the cadence of those capital sales during the quarter and if you are hearing about any material interest following AOS? Katherine Owen : So, it was clearly a big part of our booth presence and the focus and the excitement that we saw at AOS was around MAKO, which is great to see, because it obviously reinforces our long-term conviction. We have been in the capital business for a long time with our MedSurg businesses and see a very similar pattern, where you have strong year end capital sales as hospitals are looking to use up budgets and then the appropriate drop off in the first quarter, so nothing about that sequential decline surprised us. And I think it should really be reflected in expectations going forward. Now, it\u2019s not always going to be perfectly aligned with what we saw this year, but it\u2019s pretty indicative of the pattern of capital sales. Kaila Krum : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to your efforts around ICG, can you touch on any \u2013 some of the product specifications of the system, how it might be differentiated in currently available technologies and how do you plan to approach the marketplace with this device? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, I am not going to get into a lot of details as we haven\u2019t yet launched the product. It will be launched probably in the next 6 to 12 months sometime in that timeframe. But what I can tell you is it\u2019s going to be integrated into the light source that we have and that that will be a huge advantage versus having to purchase additional capital. And if so, we probably feel very good about and it will integrate exactly right into our light source, be very convenient, it will obviously be lower cost than having to purchase extra capital. And it will operate as you would expect, it will light up the common bile ducts that we will see very clearly as you are doing your dissection that you won\u2019t be able to have any kind of injury. So, it\u2019s a safety play. We are very excited about it, but again, we haven\u2019t launched it yet. And more details will become available as we get closer to the launch. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Bruce Nudell. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. This is Matt on for Bruce. Can you hear me okay? Katherine Owen : Hi, Matt. Unidentified Analyst : I was wondering can you elaborate a little bit on the supply issues in Instruments and MAKO as far as \u2013 in Instruments, what products were affected and what sort of caused the disruption and what gives you comfortable that you are back on the market when you think you are? Katherine Owen : Normal supply issues, there is nothing significant that we would call out that was of major concern, which is while we have visibility in terms of the supply returning around that related to our power tools, we should have that resolved to allow for a much stronger performance with respect to Instruments in the second half of the year. With MAKO, it will be largely resolved or will be resolved during the second quarter. Kevin Lobo : Yes, but I would think about this more like a back order and back orders happen in our industry a lot. So, it\u2019s not like we are off the market, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have to be a supply that we normally have people to fully meet our customer orders. So, that\u2019s why when I \u2013 in my prepared remarks I talked about this really being a delay. And so back orders, that typically happens as you lose the sales for a period of time, but you don\u2019t lose the sale to another company, the sale just gets delayed. And that\u2019s what we are experiencing in the Instruments area as well as MAKO. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up. Any updated thoughts on competition from lower cost offerings in hips, knees, trauma, are you seeing any change there, any increased traction, and do you see that as a significant threat this year or down the line based on what you have seen so far? Kevin Lobo : Well, I wouldn\u2019t go beyond this year. We are always going to be watching and watchful, but I\u2019d say for this year at least thus far this year, we haven\u2019t seen any change whatsoever related to either trauma or our reconstructive division and don\u2019t expect to see much or at least over the course of this year. We are always going to keep an eye on it, but thus far, no change whatsoever. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to start off with Japan business and give a little bit more color on the improvement in Q1 that you experienced. And as you annualize the ERP implementation challenges next quarter, can you quantify at all the headwind from Japan that goes away throughout the rest of 2015? And how meaningful is it to the international recon growth? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, we obviously don\u2019t provide all the details by country. What I can tell you is Japan really did turn around in all of our divisions, except for Reconstructive. So, Reconstructive, given the surgeon relationships does take a little longer to sort of gain that business back, but I was very encouraged with Trauma, with Spine as well as our MedSurg businesses. The ERP systems are all resolved. We are regaining share slowly. But I would expect that certainly by the third quarter we should be back to kind of the same level of market share that we had in the past. And so I am really pleased with how the new management has approached the challenge, like I say, in Spine and Trauma, ahead of schedule, recon is going to take a little bit longer. Josh Jennings : Great. And just on the medical unit, it\u2019s been a big driver of growth for MedSurg business, can you just talk about the organic growth rate for that unit and what\u2019s driving that and is it \u2013 is the bed replacement cycle a major component of that and capital allocation by hospitals moving away from IT? Thanks a lot. Katherine Owen : So I would say there is a small component because we did the acquisition... Kevin Lobo : CHG? Katherine Owen : Earlier in the year, but... Kevin Lobo : It\u2019s early in the year, but it\u2019s largely organic growth, virtually all of its organic growth. Katherine Owen : And I think it\u2019s very reflective of just the strength that we are seeing in the capital markets right now. We feel good about this because it\u2019s been several quarters of them really outperforming how much of that is a shift of dollars out of IT priorities, it\u2019s very difficult to get that level of granularity. What we would say is we do feel good about the momentum that we are seeing in capital across the board. The supply issue is notwithstanding because clearly we were seeing the demand there. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening, just two quick questions here. One, just on the knee business, U.S. knee business kind of two quarters in a row in the flat to up 2% range, anything specific contributing to that, competitive launches or anything else or how we should think about your U.S. knee business maybe over the next few quarters? Katherine Owen : I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific that we are seeing in that business that was clipped modestly as we mentioned by the MAKO supply issues. But there is nothing major that we are seeing in the market are different on the competitive front. Obviously, you haven\u2019t seen everybody report so far, but nothing that we would call out. Jeff Johnson : Okay. And then on the spine implant said, it sounds like that number was maybe a little bit better than fourth quarter, any changes in the end markets there, anything you can talk to on pods or payer pushback or anything, is that continuing to get a little bit better or is it still hard to tell on that front? Kevin Lobo : Yes. To me it seems like a very stable market, our performance is starting to improve. And that\u2019s what I think I spoke just earlier on the call that our management team and some of the products we have launched in the MIS space where historically we had less presence in MIS. It\u2019s starting to help us gain momentum. So it was modestly better in the first quarter and I would expect that trend to continue. Jeff Johnson : Understood. Thanks guys. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. William Plovanic : Great. Thanks. I just have a financial question for Bill, just what is the normal share dilution per year that we should think of with options coming into the model without share buyback, just normal? Bill Jellison : Yes. So I mean, based on the numbers that Katherine was talking about, I mean we would need maybe a third of that kind of level, maybe a little bit more I guess then to offset the dilution that\u2019s occurring at the same time from the share issuances? William Plovanic : So if I take your share issuances, what does that breakout into number of shares annually roughly without buyback, just what\u2019s added normally? Bill Jellison : It is probably \u2013 I mean it\u2019s only \u2013 it\u2019s just a few million. William Plovanic : Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much. Bill Jellison : It\u2019s not much associated with that. Kevin Lobo : It\u2019s pretty small. William Plovanic : Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Okay, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2015 results will be held on July 23. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

Jennings - Cowen & Co. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity Operator : Welcome to Stryker's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide updates on MAKO, neurovascular and our Transatlantic Operating Model. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers. The second quarter results underscore the momentum we are seeing across our three segments as we leverage strong sales and marketing execution and realize the benefits from both internally developed products and acquisitions. We are focused on growing organic sales at the high end of MedTech and this marks our ninth consecutive quarter of achieving organic sales growth of at least 5%. Our strong U.S. businesses which represent about 70% of our sales had stellar growth of over 9% led by double-digit growth from medical, trauma and extremities, neurotechnology and instruments. Medical and trauma continue their excellent performance and neurotechnology has been bolstered by new clinical data that Katherine will discuss. Instruments had a nice recovery from Q1 as much of their product [indiscernible] issues have been resolved. Our U.S. Spine business was also a bright spot posting 9% growth in the quarter. We are encouraged about the growth of recent product launches such as AccuLIF from the CoAlign acquisition and have a robust pipeline of new products that will be launched over the next few years. This product flow when combined with the strength in management team positions Spine well for the future. Outside the U.S., our performance was largely consistent as strength in Europe and a continued improvement in Japan was offset by some softness in other markets including parts of our China and Latin America businesses. Looking at the P&L, the establishment of our European regional headquarters and related tax benefits are tracking ahead of our expectations. As previously conveyed, we are reinvesting roughly half of our tax savings to support our new structure within Europe, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in SG&A. Our strong top line, disciplined expense management and better than expected reduction in tax resulted in adjusted EPS of $1.20, which was the upper end of our $1.15 to $1.20 range that we targeted heading into the quarter. We expect our first half momentum to continue including an improved tax rate, and consequently we are raising both our full year sales and adjusted EPS targets to 5.5% to 6.5% and $5.06 to $5.12 a share respectively. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen: Thanks, Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on MAKO, progress with our Transatlantic Operating Model or TOM as well as some comments related to our neurovascular business. Starting with MAKO, we placed 13 robots globally, representing a Q2 record. This follows a Q1 record level of nine and a Q4 2014 record of 20 robot placements. Of the 13 in Q2, we placed two in Australia which represents our first sales in this key market for Stryker where we command a market-leading position in hips and knees. During the quarter we initiated robot upgrades which will enable Stryker hip implants to start being used on the robot in Q3. The upgrades to the installed base will continue throughout 2015 and into next year. As you are aware, our Total Knee 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA late last year and we have responded to the agency's questions with no current change to our target for clearings in 2015. Shifting to TOM, with the completion of Q2, we are six months into our new Transatlantic structure and are pleased with the progress we are making to optimize our European presence. We continue to invest in this initiative through a portion of the tax savings and all of our key leaders and commercial structures are in place. We continue to see improving top line momentum in Europe and believe we are well-positioned for further acceleration particularly as we head into 2016. Finally, the European regional headquarters represent the flagship for our presence in Europe as we bring [HCPs] [ph] into this site for training and education. We believe this will be key to strengthening the Stryker brand in Europe and enhancing our relationships with physicians at hospitals. Lastly, I will make some comments relating to our neurovascular business. As Kevin mentioned, we like the momentum in neuromuscular space and the recent update of AHA/ASA guidelines are one of the multiple drivers to market expansion. We expect to see similar guidelines coming from Europe and Japan. Specifically in June for the first time, the AHA recommended that patient should receive endovascular therapy with a stent retriever for the treatment of ischemic stroke which represents the vast majority of the roughly 800,000 strokes that occur annually in the U.S. alone. These guidelines represent the first new stroke treatment in two decades to win AHA's strongest backing. The usual treatment of an ischemic stroke is to administer a clot dissolving drug known as tPA. However, the drug must be given within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. With stent retriever, the clot can be quickly removed in the patient to restore blood flow to critical vessels in the brain. Late last year and earlier this year several major studies including the MR CLEAN study found stent retrievers dramatically cut the risk of death or disability in patients whose clots persisted after treatment with tPA. The new AHA guidelines recommend patients be treated with a stent retriever if it can be done within six hours of symptom onset and if they have a severe stroke caused by a clot in a large artery. Clearly the mounting clinical data and support from AHA underscore the opportunity for endovascular treatment of stroke. However, it's important to note that much work needs to be done to further develop the market, including the optimization of EMS transport systems and inter-hospital transfers, protocols and hospital infrastructure and investment in the human and physical capital to absorb the patient volume. Stryker remains committed to continuing its investment in stroke innovation with the recent launches of Trevo 6mm, 3mm and the 40/30 or long Trevo, this combined with further clinical studies such as the DAWN trial for late and wake-up stroke patients. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. William R. Jellison: Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 2.9% in the second quarter including a negative 4.7% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7.6%, which includes organic growth of 6.9%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the second quarter were $1.03 per share versus $0.33 per share last year in the second quarter, while adjusted EPS were $1.20 per share for the quarter versus $1.08 per share in the second quarter of last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.07 per share from FX, in line with our original guidance. Most foreign exchange rates were again weaker against the dollar than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc along with our layered hedging program helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter as many of our products are manufactured within Europe. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relate to a charge of approximately $112 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II, offset somewhat by a favorable legal settlement with Zimmer Biomet. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. Looking at sales in the second quarter, our organic growth of 6.9% was comprised of a positive 8.7% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.8 percentage points. Acquisitions added 0.7%, while FX had a negative 4.7% impact on the sales in the quarter. Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of orthopaedic products were up 0.6% as reported and grew 6.2% constant currency and increased 5.3% organically. U.S. orthopaedic sales grew 8.3% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities had another standout quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 18%, reflecting approximately 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business, including strong double-digit organic growth. U.S. hips continued its strong performance and grew 5.7% in the second quarter, while U.S. knees increased 2.8% against a tough 7% comp last year. Internationally, sales were a positive 1.1% in hips in constant currency and increased 5.3% in knees in constant currency. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 3.9% as reported with 7.4% in constant currency and increased 6.7% organically. These results were led once again by double-digit organic and constant currency growth in our medical business as our sales force combined with a strong product offering continue to execute. We also experienced upper single-digit constant currency growth in instruments as we restored shipments from a supply issue which negatively impacted the first quarter. Endoscopy grew by 3.2% in constant currency against double-digit organic comps in the second quarter last year. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 19% of our sales in the quarter, increased 6.4% as reported and 11.5% organically. Growth in this segment was led by strong double-digit growth in each of our Neurotechnology businesses including neurovascular, CMF, and NSE. Spinal implant sales increased mid-single-digit in the quarter and high single-digits in the U.S. as new products energised the business. In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2015 were 66.3%, compared to 65.9% in the second quarter last year. The increase in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year resulted from negative pricing pressures which were more than offset by favorable mix, FX and operational efficiencies. Pricing declined 1.8% in the quarter, in line with our expectations of approximately 2 percentage point decline. Research and development expenses were 6.3% of sales, slightly lower than last year in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $879 million or 36.1% of sales in the quarter versus 35.3% in the prior year period. The cost increases were driven in part by our decision to reinvest roughly half of our tax savings to strengthen our European selling and marketing activities and support our new European regional headquarter. We also incurred higher compensation cost including commissions tied to our stronger sales performance, partly offset by improved cost controls in many of our indirect spending categories. Adjusting for these items on a year-to-date basis, we would be delivering leverage of 30 to 40 basis points and we are confident in our ability to deliver at least this level of expense leverage in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key initiatives in this area. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.8% in the second quarter of 2015, nearly flat with the second quarter of 2014. The rate reflects solid operational improvements coupled with favorable mix, largely offset by our investments to support our European business, negative price and compensation cost tied to our strong sales performance. Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $30 million, which is flat with last year in the second quarter. Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 2.2 percentage points, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 16.8%. This compares to a 22.4% adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter last year. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately a third of it held in the U.S. We also had $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended in the second quarter at 55 days, slightly below last year's second quarter, and days in inventory finished the quarter at 173, just a little better than the 177 days in the second quarter last year. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first half of 2015 were $737 million compared to $579 million last year in the first half. Capital expenditures were $114 million in the first half of 2015 compared to $124 million in the same period last year. However, capital expenditures are expected to run higher than last year as we move through 2015. We expect significant cash outflows associated with our Rejuvenate settlement in the second half of this year with a major portion of the funding occurring in the third quarter. So far in the third quarter we have paid out $786 million and we expect to fund a total of approximately $1.2 billion this quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is expected to be sourced from OUS cash. Also, as we previously mentioned, we have repatriated approximately $700 million in the first half of the year and expect to repatriate nearly $1 billion more late in this year. We still have over $2 billion available for share repurchase under our recently expanded authorization, as approximately $324 million of share repurchases were made by the end of the second quarter. We will continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next two to three years. Our strong second quarter results give us additional confidence in our ability to deliver improved operating results for the year. We are increasing our guidance for both sales and earnings for 2015. Our sales guidance now includes constant currency growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect the net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3.5% to 4%. Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be nearly 2% declines for the Company moving forward, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced over the last year. The benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year-end earnings guidance and represents approximately $0.05 per share for the year. We continue to expect that they will once again be approved. However, we do not expect them to be renewed until late in the year. As such, we do not have any benefit from them in our actual results or our planned earnings guidance until the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect that our adjusted tax rate will run at or below the level achieved in the first half of the year and will be noticeably better in the period the tax extenders are approved. Based on current FX rates, we expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 per share for the full year. Keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rate movement is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge. And finally, we are also increasing our earnings guidance for 2015. Our adjusted net earnings per share is now $5.06 to $5.12, with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 for the third quarter of 2015. Thanks again for your support and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert A. Hopkins: Congrats on a really good quarter. So just two things I want to touch on, one for Bill and then one for Kevin. First, Bill, one of the questions that we've gotten pretty consistently from investors relates to your ability to drop through operating margin leverage and I know you made the comment about 30 to 40 basis points of drop through, so was that an SG&A or an operating margin comment and is that the kind of leverage you want us to expect you to be able to deliver as we look forward? William R. Jellison: Sure. That comment, Bob, was specifically on our SG&A component and we wanted to just make that clear because we're making some nice reductions within that area currently. However, as you can tell, that's obviously being masked by a couple of things this year and we wanted to highlight that. I think also as we relate to 2016 comment, we're highly confident in our ability to create that leverage, but again that's just at the expense level and we'll talk more broadly about our operating income levels as we give our regular guidance. But you should expect and you're seeing our gross profit margin improvement currently show up and as I mentioned earlier this year, we should have better comparables against gross margin as we move through this year. And so if we're getting any level of gross margin improvement, which we believe should be flat to a slight positive in a more neutral FX related environment, along with some of the SG&A related leverage that we just talked about, you should expect leverage at the operating income line as well moving forward. Robert A. Hopkins: Great, thank you. And then for Kevin and Katherine, obviously you're seeing some clear strengths across your businesses and as you think about capital allocation, does the strength of your business change at all, how you think about capital allocation priorities, does M&A remain the top priority, if you could just speak to that how this [clear strength] [ph] in your business might be impacting your thought process there, that would be helpful? Kevin A. Lobo: Thanks Bob. Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged and we still have M&A as our first priority and use of cash and you can see based on the activities done over the past couple of years, they are contributing to our esteemed organic growth performance because after the anniversary of the first year then they become part of our organic business, and we still see significant scope for acquisitions within the three segments that we planned to date. So that continues to remain number one and as we've mentioned previously, dividends we intend to have steady increases at least as fast as our earnings growth, potentially a little bit faster than that, and then share repurchase is the more fungible one which really varies depending on the timing and the flow of deals which as you know is inherently uncertain. But no change to our strategy, the strength of our business frankly reinforces the strategy that we've been deploying over the past few years. Operator : The next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Lewis: Kevin, what I find interesting about this particular quarter, if we look at various segments that you were enthusiastic about at AOS, namely spine, neuro and MAKO, they've all come through and frankly I think most would agree have come through faster than most were expecting, so I think it would be helpful, based on your earlier enthusiasm, what's sort of your conviction on a continuation of the trends you're seeing here in the second quarter in those key businesses, spine, neuro and MAKO? Kevin A. Lobo: So I feel very good about all three of those businesses. Neuro has been a trend we've seen frankly for multiple quarters and it's now being accelerated because of the ischemic stroke segment that Katherine mentioned which will be a multiyear journey, and that was based on the Concentric acquisition which we did in October of 2012. So neuro has been really a continuation of a multiple quarter experience. On MAKO we turned the corner really about the midpoint of last year and you've seen sustained improvement and I expect that to continue. We're of course very anxious for the Total Knee approval which we believe will be another catalyst for enhanced growth, but our organization really has embraced this, the sales force integration is now really humming. So we're feeling very, very good momentum and excited. We got over our back order issue that plagued us a little bit in the first quarter, we were able to get through that on MAKO in the second quarter, so feel good about that. Spine really is the one business that's turned the most and the most recently, and I'm really encouraged because it's based on a combination of product launches and numerous product launches. If you look over the past two years, we've launched more than we did in the past four years. If you look in the first half of this year, we've launched more in any six-month period than we've launched probably in the last three, four, five years. So we've really gained momentum, we have new R&D leadership that has an exciting flow of products, and of course we've added some acquisitions as well with CoAlign, with the BIO4 biologics. So we have a number of products and the product flow going forward I feel very good about, and as you've seen in spine, innovation is rewarded and you grow through innovation in new products and that's a truism across large and small players in spine. So the innovation is alive and well in spine and our management team has been strengthened over the past year or two. So I feel very good about our prospects of spine going forward. David R. Lewis: Okay, very clear, thanks Kevin. And maybe just a deeper dive, Katherine, on MAKO, I think what's interesting is that business has basically gone up every quarter last four to five quarters. This particular quarter you doubled MAKO installed systems year-on-year but we still haven't seen a significant impact from either product approvals on hip or potentially obviously the knee in the latter half of the year. So what is driving the momentum in MAKO? Is it simply a sales reorganization focus or are we starting to see the enthusiasm for existing approvals and the approvals coming obviously in a few months? Katherine A. Owen: I would say, David, it's more the former as we've got the integration challenges that we had early on last year behind us and the team is really working together in leveraging the considerable breadth and depth that we bring along with the MAKO expertise. We are in the process as I mentioned around doing the necessary software upgrade that will enable us to start to put our hip implant on the MAKO. We have the clearance but we have to do that work and that will continue through this year and into next year as well. And then the knee indication, we are looking to get that clearance hopefully sometime in 2015, it's in the hands of the FDA. But keep in mind it is going to be three, four quarters before we've gone through the necessary training and upgrade and work that's going to be needed to be done to make sure that that launch is truly optimized. So I would make sure to just consider that it will not be a light switch when we get that indication. It clearly enhances the value proposition of having a robot, but it is going to take some time to make sure we really optimize that launch. Operator : The next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David H. Roman: I was hoping we could come back to the neurovascular business. Understandably, Katherine, in your comments you talked about the need for training and development and educating the market around the new guidelines, but if we look at the numbers that your key competitors put up in their most recent quarter as well as the step-up we saw in your business today, it does look like the market was sort of ready to get moving here. So maybe you could just help us think about how we should size this opportunity on a go forward basis and whether the growth rates we're seeing now are reflective of something sustainable or some type of pent-up demand waiting for clinical data and new guidelines? Katherine A. Owen: I think that there are some well-established in the minority stroke centers that were well-prepared for this clinical data that we're expecting it to be positive but they had done a lot of that market development and had the patient inter-hospital transfers and the various work that needs to be done completed. So they were good to go but that does not represent the majority of places where patients would need to go. So I think you're seeing an early benefit but there really is going to need to be a lot of market enhancement work done between us and others as well as additional clinical data. So we feel really excited, the data is truly compelling and the impact that this can have on patients is just it's clear that these devices have a very clear role to play, but it will take time for this to be broadly applicable with all stroke centers which is what we're trying to signal. I think it's too early for us to size the market up. We'll just have to see how this plays out on paper with roughly 80% of the 800,000 patients who have a stroke being ischemic and get to some very big numbers, but I don't think we want to get too far ahead right now until we've got some more time to see how the market develops and the neurovascular community embraces the data and the market development work. David H. Roman: Okay, and maybe just secondarily, and another question on MAKO, I think Kevin one of the things you talked about at AOS was your different ways to sort of get the capital out there and target some of the Biomet accounts. Could you just maybe talk about how any sort of the changed commercial strategy may be impacting the business today and any opportunities that may arise out of the Zimmer Biomet transactions, some of the divestitures that were required for completion there around Unis? Kevin A. Lobo: I'm not exactly sure I follow your question there. Just so in terms of relating the Unis the Zimmer Biomet to MAKO, is that your question? David H. Roman: I think as one of the divestitures required for FDC clearance was some of the Zimmer Uni product, so are you seeing any disruption in the market thus far that would provide an incremental opportunity for MAKO associated with that transaction? Kevin A. Lobo: I would say it's really too early. I mean this deal is just closing right now. We haven't seen much of an impact there. The MAKO already had a very sizable portion of the Uni market as it was and certainly every time there is a change, any type of acquisition, whether we're doing an acquisition or whether someone else is doing an acquisition, as the companies integrate there usually is opportunity. So we'll see how that plays out but right now it's too early to say. It really didn't impact this quarter, that's for sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen M. Stewart: I was just wondering if you can just reconcile the change in guidance just in terms of the EPS. I know that looks like FX is a little less negative relative to where you were guiding previously. I think in the first quarter you had said it was going to be a $0.25 to $0.30 headwind. I think the tax rate went down and the organic growth went up and you're reinvesting a little bit. So maybe just help me understand some of the moving parts just in terms of where numbers are going, how much of it is organic moving versus reinvestment and so forth? William R. Jellison: Kristen, this is Bill and I think that as far as our overall guidance is concerned, we've obviously had some positives on a number of fronts. I mean our sales and operations are doing very well, we've increased our top line sales guidance obviously. Taxes obviously also a little bit better than our \u2013 quite a bit better as well than talking about earlier, at least for the street, and then as far FX is concerned, that might be $0.01 or $0.02 better for the whole year than what was there. But I think that there's also on an ongoing basis there's a lot of other dynamics that are in the marketplace as well that we need to make sure that we're taking into account and it's truly the combination of all those positives and negatives that we're looking at. Also keep in mind on the tax side that we have stated all year long that we've been expecting to reinvest about half of that which is what you're seeing in kind of the SG&A side. We have been expecting that investment upfront in the year and so that's also reflected in the numbers that you're hearing. Kristen M. Stewart: Okay. And then, so I guess the best way to think about it is, if not for the reinvestment, you guys would have clearly \u2013 I guess what would've been the underlying operational EPS growth if not for the reinvestment? William R. Jellison: Keep in mind on the reinvestment, [talk] [ph] to the reinvestment is actually to support that overall project which is running through the SG&A and other part of it is what we've talked about upfront with our Transatlantic Operating Model and some of the additional support that we want to be putting in our sales and marketing efforts, especially within Europe, and I think that we're also already seeing some at least positive motivation in activities around that move at this point and we expect that that's got a multiyear benefit for us. And as we talk about kind of the leverage that we've got with our underlying operating expenses, we believe that we're actually delivering that already this year and that's why we're also committing to some level of that at least externally as I mentioned on the call earlier. Kevin A. Lobo: I think, Kristen, this is Kevin, just wanted to underscore what Bill said, so a good portion of the reinvestment is establishing that European structure and there's cost related to that. So the tax benefit, it's not like a one-time event that's a windfall. This is like remapping our transactions, creating a structure, creating this headquarters. There was a significant amount of cost involved in creating that. Of course it's driving significant financial benefits through the tax plan and those benefits will be there for years to come. So this for us is an investment that is clearly paying off but it is directly related to each other and it's not that the tax area is just a windfall and comes for free. There was a cost associated. It appears on two different lines of the P&L, but net, it's a huge positive for us and one of the contributors to our raised guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael N. Weinstein: So let me start off, I'll pick up actually and maybe push a little bit on the guidance as well, if I went back to really the tax discussion, it goes back to the analyst meeting right last year and that's when you disclosed that it would be a couple of hundred basis point benefit from the European setup and that you were going to invest half of that, but since the start of the year the tax rate guidance has come down by what would basically imply say about 350 basis points, so that's like $0.20, and then initially the FX headwind was $0.30 and now it's $0.25. So that's $0.25 of kind of incremental call it less headwind or call it incremental tailwind for you guys and you've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.16 since the start of the year but you've only raised the top end by $0.02. Are you putting earnings away at this point for a rainy day? Tell us just, reconcile the math I just walked through versus how much you've raised guidance so far this year. William R. Jellison: Sure. Mike, I think one point to make is really around the tax rate side of the equation and we in taking a look at kind of the expectation this year, we clearly knew that it was going to be a better than 2% impact for this year. From a directional perspective to the street, we wanted to give guidance to say that it was a meaningful improvement but we really didn't fully like identified that until we saw that run through our number. We wanted to commit to it. And just like with our investments that we were doing within that area, same thing. We were spending a certain amount of money upfront that we knew we were comfortable with but we also were holding some back and making sure that we wanted to see that realize through our earnings statements before we really are releasing that. But our total expectation for the project is in line and which was the commitment for us to reinvest half of that total savings back into the business, both to support that structure which was pretty significant to support the change in the structure that we have within Europe, but then also to really ramp up some of our sales and marketing activities there. Michael N. Weinstein: Okay. So the answer is, you are not putting earnings away for a rainy day, and I have one follow-up so the operators don't cut me off, but just talk for a minute about U.S. spine because obviously this is the best quarter in a while and just would love to hear your thoughts on it. William R. Jellison: Mike, so just getting back, so for our guidance, obviously the guidance is really for our operational performance and so things \u2013 when we give our third quarter guidance, that's where we believe our operational range will be for the third quarter. Of course if the tax changes, we've now after six months of our original headquarters, we've now got a very good view of our tax rate. So you're not going to see as much volatility in our tax rate in the third and the fourth quarter. You can be much more reliable. As you enter a new structure like this, there's a lot of unknowns. We worked through those unknowns in the first half of the year, so now we're feeling a lot better about that. So you won't see as much volatility as we saw in the first six months and we do try to guide around what's going to happen operationally and then of course things like FX and unknown things happen over the quarter that can move us up or down within the range. On spine, so it's been a while in the works, right. So we hired, I mentioned I think at academy a year ago, not this year but the prior year that we had hired a new spine R&D leader and re-established a real focus on innovation which had been lacking in our spine business, and we've launched a lot of products in the first half of this year and we have a really robust pipeline. So product flow is I would say number one issue. We also have enhanced some of our management team in spine, stabilized the sales force, and so we really have a good offense. We were running a very profitable business before but we weren't growing very fast and we've now turned on the engine of growth really behind new products. And it's not something that I see as a one-hit wonder. Of course each quarter is dynamic. This is one good quarter. But I do see a sustained path for good results for multiple quarters going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew C. Taylor: I have a couple of questions I guess, one was just, if I look at the pricing in Recon, it actually got a little bit better this quarter, it was the best it has been in I guess six quarters. So I wondered if there was any real change there or if that's just within the range of normal variability? Katherine A. Owen: I would put that in the range of normal variability. It can bounce around in the 10s of basis points. So obviously it's better when it improves or it's less negative, but I wouldn't point to any change or difference in what's going on in the market. Matthew C. Taylor: Thanks. And have you seen any disruption from the ongoing combinations at your different ortho competitors and maybe just comment on how you're seeing such strong growth in trauma and foot and ankle. Katherine A. Owen: We haven't really seen any impact from the Biomet Zimmer merger recognizing that. It had just recently closed. So we'll see how that plays out. We're certainly not going to underestimate them as a competitor. They are two formidable organizations but we are also very focused on continuing to drive growth and execute on MAKO. And then on trauma and extremities? Kevin A. Lobo: Just on trauma and extremities, this has been a multi-year story, right. So if you look at 2012, 2013, 2014, each of those years in the U.S. we grew at least 15% and based on the first half of this year it's safe to say it looks like we're going to deliver another 15% or more growth. So that's four years in a row. So we've just seen sustained performance. Foot and ankle has been a huge contributor to that, that continues to grow extremely well and it's a little bit like the stroke market Katherine is talking about, it's been a market development story, so kind of hard to predict. It's frankly exceeded our expectations when we created the foot and ankle business unit but that's a team that knows how to perform, it's been performing consistently year after year. So we're excited. We still have a lot of room for growth in upper extremities. So while we're very pleased with our performance, it's not that we've reached the end of the growth opportunity. We're still actually a smaller player in upper extremities and we see that as potentially exciting area for the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Glenn J. Novarro: I wanted to just follow up on pricing in light of what CMS announced with respect to this pilot program on bundling, we've been getting a lot of incoming questions about does this put pressure on price longer-term. So my first question Kevin is, what are your thoughts on this whole bundling project? Kevin A. Lobo: So what we saw with the initial pilots on the bundled payments is we really didn't see any different dynamic in pricing. So the price pressure we expect will continue as it is currently. Once they start to focus on the total episode of care in a bundled payment, they tend to make much more focus on post-acute costs, which frankly outpace the cost of an implant. So we see this as a trend that really doesn't disrupt the implant pricing. We'll have the same pressures we had before. If anything, it might start to drive them to rationalize towards less suppliers of implants. In that world, we like that kind of consolidation to us is an environment where we feel we're well-positioned to win. So to us this is a dynamic that we've seen in pockets and we haven't seen our business adversely affected by a move to bundled payments. It's like I say, the post-acute costs are very significant and once they're shown in spotlight that's where I believe more of the focus will be placed than on the implant cost. That's not to say the implant costs are not immune from price pressure, but I don't see it as a new catalyst. Glenn J. Novarro: Got it. And then just on medicals and other, it was a very good strong medical quarter, and I just wonder if that's a function of the favorable CapEx environment that we're in today or is it a function of your new product cadence or maybe both? Katherine A. Owen: I would attribute it to both. The medical group is doing a great job executing on product launches, some of which you may have seen at our product fair in June. The environment is stable, it's inherently volatile as we've seen over the years, but the outlook is very stable right now is how I would characterize CapEx, particularly for medical. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : First question for Bill, you mentioned the 30 to 40 basis points of SG&A leverage in 2016 and you said flat to positive gross margin leverage in an FX neutral situation. Can you just describe what kind of pricing dynamics or decline, what's the threshold at which maybe it's flat to negative? William R. Jellison: Sure. So that obviously relates to the gross profit margin piece of it and from that perspective we still are expecting about a 2 percentage point price decline level. As we've talked about before, as you're in that kind of 2% level, we believe we can get a normal kind of FX related environment. We believe we can still keep margins flat and actually hopefully still improve them slightly based on kind of all the cost initiatives that we have in that area. If pricing improves and is like 1.5%, we've talked that that actually creeps up to maybe into the 20 to 40 basis points of improvement level, and obviously if it goes north of 2% that also has a more negative related impact. But again we see prices pretty much in line with where we are this year which is right in that 2% range. Richard Newitter : Okay, that's helpful. And then for Katherine, the total knee on the MAKO solution sometime in 2015, should we be thinking that when you do in fact get approval there, even though we might not see it in the actual kind of implant numbers for knees and the growth rates there, should we expect some sort of step-up in your ability to play systems, are there customers for whom the value proposition will become that much more apparent? Katherine A. Owen: Without a doubt those customers who are going to see greater value in the robot with more applications and the total knee is the biggest one. I have no doubt there are some who have waited and I'm not sure I would necessarily model some step function change or bolus, this is a tough business to model, but it clearly strengthens the value proposition, but really the real driver will be a few quarters out once we start to do the upgrades and see more and more traction. So I think in theory it makes sense, I think we'd be a little bit hesitant to get too aggressive and modeling any type of step function change. Operator : Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Rajbir S. Denhoy: Just wanted to ask a question on spine business, when that business was not performing well, there were lots of questions about whether you would want to do an acquisition there to perhaps jumpstart the performance. I guess my question is, as you've now seen a resumption in performance and you've described it as kind of being longer-term or at least having some durability, does that change your view on that business and really how much, how long you'll wait for it to grow, if that makes sense, I apologize? Katherine A. Owen: I think the way we continue to view it as clearly M&A is the primary use of our cash as we've talked about, we have dedicated BD people in all of our divisions who are actively looking at targets and that's the reason why we were able to identify CoAlign and seen the benefit of that product from that acquisition. So they are always going to be out looking at ways to augment the portfolio, but first and foremost we look to invest in the business and build it organically. And so we're never going to rule out acquisition targets in any area and they're going to vary in size. As you know most of ours tend to be relatively small to midsized targets but those BD people will continue to look at market opportunities. Rajbir S. Denhoy: I guess as that business performs better, do you have more patience in a sense for it, or do you still feel like you need to do something to it, because I guess you described wanting to be bigger in that business longer term? Katherine A. Owen: I don't want to speak to any specific division. We said we're focused on our core and key adjacent markets and spine is one of them but we also do a lot of relatively smaller deals that I'm not going to rule out continuing to augment our portfolio. We do that when businesses are performing well and we continue to invest in them. So there's no deviation or change in the overall strategy. Each deal will stand on its own merits but I wouldn't want to single out any one division and say they are off the BD market for any period of time. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Jason H. Wittes: Just a couple of follow-ups. First, the reinvestment that you're doing in Europe, can we assume that that's finite period, I mean basically just through the end of this year or how long will that reinvestment period run through? William R. Jellison: So the investments that we are actually making there would be investments that would occur on an ongoing basis but off of the same level, right. So we're investing about half of that tax savings this year but you should think of that just a normal step-up for what we're doing within the European side, but as we're moving forward we would expect to grow that new base level and leverage it as well against our sales growth as we would anything else, and that's why we wanted to reiterate that you should expect to see at least that 30 to 40 basis point of improvement in the SG&A line category for next year. [Indiscernible] like a one-time investment, this is an investment that changes the base of business moving forward. Jason H. Wittes: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Trevo, I think Katherine based on your comments, it sounds like the large stroke centers have pretty quickly picked up on the data and have changed their practices but if you start going to more regional or smaller centers it's unclear whether they are moving in that direction just yet. Is that the right way to think about what is going on in the marketplace right now? Katherine A. Owen: Yes, it's going very well with established stroke centers that are very sophisticated and who are ready to go. I think a lot of those other stroke centers are waiting for data to be a catalyst to say we have to start to do this work, and this data that's come in like MR CLEAN and will be coming in is certainly that catalyst but it takes time. If you think about that laundry list of market development items I mentioned, those are not something that will happen in a quarter or two, it will be a few years but it's clearly supported by the data that I think will prompt many of those to start to make those changes in investments. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead. Mike Matson : I guess first of all I just wanted to see if the selling days this quarter were the same as the year ago quarter. Katherine A. Owen: Yes, there's no change in selling days. Mike Matson : Okay thanks. And then I know it's a smaller deal but I was just wondering if you could comment on the [indiscernible] medical acquisition that you did. Katherine A. Owen: We are excited about that. The medical group is clearly excited about it. We had a relationship with them, a distribution agreement going back to 2012. The company has been around for nearly 50 years, a private company based out of Turkey, and they've done a great job. They specialize in the design and manufacture of hospital beds and structures and they've been primarily serving the Turkish market around eight countries. So it's a great opportunity for us to build a presence in that segment with a premium value product. We know them well, so we are comfortable with where they are located in their manufacturing facilities, and it really helps to further strengthen our portfolio longer-term. So it's a small deal, [indiscernible] very modest, not material incremental sales but clearly a great product franchise to further bolster what medical is doing. Mike Matson : And are those products intended to be sold globally or is it more for the European markets or emerging markets? Katherine A. Owen: It's primarily for the Turkish and surrounding countries as well as some in Latin America. Longer-term we'll wait and see what direction we're going with this but you should not be thinking about that as a near-term U.S. product offering. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence H. Biegelsen: So just starting with neurotech, so we understand that a lot of physicians prefer to use an aspiration device with a stent retriever, do you guys have any plans to introduce your own aspiration device and if so what's the timing, and I have a follow-up? Katherine A. Owen: One of the great things about neurovascular, both the hemorrhagic and ischemic side, is there is so much opportunity for innovation and you've seen that over the last few years with technologies coming out and we have a very robust pipeline on the R&D side. I'm not going to get into specifics at this time around which products and the timing of them, but I will say we're very comfortable as one of the market leaders here and with the talent in our R&D team, we are well-positioned both with our current portfolio and future generations of products that we'll be introducing, but I'm not going to get any more specific at this time around timelines. Lawrence H. Biegelsen: I understand. And then Kevin, you mentioned some softness in China, can you talk about what you're seeing there? And just very quickly, Bill, on the tax rate, I'm a little confused what tax rate to use this year. I mean last quarter you said less than 20% but it's like trying to get about 18% in the first half without the R&D tax credit. Kevin A. Lobo: I'll start with the China question. So we saw a really good performance with our implant business. Where we saw the slowdown was in capital equipment. We saw that quite sluggish in China in the second quarter and we even saw in Latin America also the issues that we had were more pronounced in capital equipment than in our implant business. William R. Jellison: And associated with the tax rate question that you asked, our year to date operating tax rate is about 18.1%, and as I mentioned in the call script, we're comfortable with a rate for the full year at or slightly below that. Keep in mind as you mentioned the tax extenders are not in that number yet. So when the tax extenders are ultimately approved, hopefully by the fourth quarter of this year, in that period you will actually see the tax rate dip down again in that one period obviously but because that would be a full-year benefit of those extenders being picked up in the fourth quarter, but for an average rate for this year we would expect to be a little bit below what our average trend rate is right now and I think that that's relatively a consistent tax rate that you can project for next year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew OBrien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matthew OBrien : Kevin, as I look across the businesses, it looks like the performance is quite strong across the platform but it seems like it's more volume driven than anything that we've seen historically the last couple of years I should say. Is that a function of benefiting from things like ACA, the deferrals in CapEx that are now kind of coming through and then AHA guidelines in neuro, and is that something that you feel comfortable being able to smoothly transition through or lap as we get into next year some of those benefits not being as much of a tailwind? Kevin A. Lobo: So it's hard to generalize because every division has its own story. So if you look at trauma and extremities and the performance there, that's a lot of innovation, creating a new business unit for foot and ankle. So I think each division has its own story. The overall tailwind around capital equipment is undeniable and I think you see that in the marketplace. So that's been a real positive. But if you look at our instruments division as an example, even before the tailwind they were really performing at a very, very high level and double-digit growth kind of performer and getting Neptune back on the market and growth there. So I feel really strongly about all of our divisions' leadership, their innovation pipeline, looking at the way they look at acquisitions, I get a chance to go around and visit with every division and we strengthened our leadership in many areas and we have very, very strong positions. So we were growing faster than the market when the markets were a little bit down. Now the market is certainly moving up in the capital equipment side and we're taking full advantage, but you can see even in an area like medical that's done two deals just in the past year, they are smaller deals but they are adding to the innovation that they are doing organically and innovation wins. And so when the market is good, you see the numbers are buoyed but I'm not worried about as we get into comparatives that are a little bit higher that we can sustain strong growth. Matthew OBrien : Okay, very helpful. And then as a follow-up question, just looking at the environment that we're in right now with extremely low interest rates and robust equity markets, I'm just curious on the asset side of things. You've done a couple of smaller deals recently but are the valuations that are out in the marketplace right now for some of the larger acquisitions, even midsized acquisitions targets getting to the point where it just doesn't make sense or you are unable to meet your internal hurdle rates with some of those assets, and if that's the case, are you willing to, given the environment, adjust your internal hurdle rates? Katherine A. Owen: I would say clearly valuations have moved up. We are always confronted with challenges around valuations, sellers' expectations even in an environment that hasn't been quite as strong as recently. So it's always going to be a factor that we've got to consider, it hasn't changed our priority around M&A but it certainly does become an issue on some deals and that does impact the numbers we look at. At this time there's no change in terms of \u2013 sorry, the second part of your question when you talk about our hurdle rates and returns, we're pretty disciplined and the approach we take there we think that makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne K. Wuensch: Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but briefly in China you made a number of investments there over the years, I remember Trauson very well. Do you have the footprint there that you want to have? Kevin A. Lobo: Overall, we still have a long way to go in China. I would say the Trauson acquisition was a great deal for trauma and spine and we're expanding in China. We are still about to launch in India, so we don't sell Trauson yet in India. We're launching that in the second half of this year. We are still waiting for approvals in Brazil. We will launch that next year. So I think Trauson has a lot of room to grow outside China. Inside China I'm very pleased with that but we don't yet have lower-priced hip and knee offering. That's something that you could see in the foreseeable future, that's something we'd want to pursue. We're not still covering all of the territories in China, so we're continuing to grow our sales force in some of the more remote areas where we still don't have access. So we've been growing our China business very strongly over the past five, six years in both the premium segment as well as the lower-priced or mid-tier segment, but we still have a long way to go. I would say that the market potential in China is still very significant. Right now obviously you're hearing a lot about the China slowdown but I think within healthcare we still believe we have a lot of room to grow, and certainly on the MedSurg side that's been an area of the endoscopy business, it's been a very strong business but our other MedSurg businesses don't yet have a very, very strong footprint in China. So we still see a lot of opportunity and we are learning a lot about the mid-tier segment and Trauson was our first foray into that segment and figuring out how to win in that marketplace with other products is something that I see maybe not the next year but in the next five years as very important for Stryker. So we still have a long way to go. Joanne K. Wuensch: I appreciate that. As a follow-up, one of the areas or one of the ways that spine has grown is investment in the sales force. Is there a way to qualitatively talk about how much larger that sales force looks like today versus 12, 18, 24 months ago? Kevin A. Lobo: In which country, sorry? Oh, she got cut off, I'm sorry. The question was in China, so we obviously use a distributor network in China and we have a separate set of distributors for the Stryker premium business and a separate set of distributors for the mid-tier segment. And what I mentioned to you is we've got very good coverage in the big cities and in some of the surrounding areas but pushing to the western part of China we still have room to grow and that will largely be through expanding the distributor network. So it's not so much about direct sales force, it's more about making sure we have the right distributors to cover the rest of the country. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Joshua T. Jennings: I just wanted to start on MAKO, Katherine you mentioned two systems placed in Australia and maybe if you could just give us an update on plans for OUS launches in other countries or are we getting ahead of ourselves? Katherine A. Owen: I think it's going to continue to be dominated by the U.S. robot placement. Australia is a market where as I mentioned we have very strong market positions in both hips and knees. So it's a market that made a lot of sense but I think as you go forward I would really focus on U.S. is going to be the primary driver of the placements. Joshua T. Jennings: Just in emerging markets business, pardon me if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about \u2013 you talked a lot about China but just other avenues within emerging markets where you are in terms of your trajectory this year and actually in the first half of 2015 and any initiatives you can to accelerate your emerging market growth? William R. Jellison: So I would say after China, which has been a really strong market, our strongest emerging market is China at Stryker, after that I would say I'm really pleased with our progress in India where we're growing very, very well from a small base admittedly but we're having very good performance starting from last year in India and it seems to be very sustained growth. The other priority market is Brazil and Brazil obviously is going through a pretty tough recession right now. We also had some issues where we had to change one of our spine dealers in Sao Paulo and that caused a bit of an issue in our spine business, and so we have that from time to time in Brazil which represents roughly half of Latin America. So Latin America is for the future very important for us and we're quite a small player, but I would say this year because of the recession in Brazil, it's not going quite as well as it has in the past couple of years but certainly an important market in the long term. Areas like Russia and Turkey are actually doing quite well but you can imagine those are not exactly the most attractive markets, at least at the moment, but those are the other two emerging market countries that are going to be a top priority for us, but we are measuring our investments. We had planned, if you look back maybe three years ago we were planning to really invest more vigorously in Russia and Turkey and given the macroeconomic conditions there, we have tempered our investments in those two countries. But clearly it represents about 8% of our sales at Stryker emerging markets and we would like that number to be much higher but the conditions have to be right and we want to make sure we get a good return on our investment, but those are a couple of markets that are doing very well and there are other ones that I think we're going to be a little bit more measured in the pace of our investments. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic. Please go ahead. William J. Plovanic: First on the foot and ankle, that's grown really well for you. Would you say that you're creating the market with procedural kitting or do you think that's more taking share from existing players in the foot and ankle piece? Kevin A. Lobo: With the kind of growth we've had over the past few years, I would say the bulk of it is market development, but you can't grow at this kind of rate without taking some share. So I'm sure we've taken some share along the way but this has been really more about a new market story where we're getting people that weren't using implants to start to use implants. That's been the biggest engine of growth within foot and ankle. William J. Plovanic: Okay. And then on MAKO, as you place these systems and that's reaccelerated, is this based more on an alternative financing method or are these kind of direct sales? Kevin A. Lobo: I would say we have a flex financial unit within Stryker that provides various options to make capital easier to acquire and we have used that for some of the sales of the robot. But frankly though the vast majority have been direct purchases thus far, so the hospitals are finding the capital and they are [pruning] [ph] it up but we do have an arsenal of, a range of options for them to choose from, and I think going forward \u2013 certainly Europe is an example, as we start to expand MAKO in Europe I think using financing will be much more prevalent than it is here in the U.S., but in the U.S. they've been, the vast majority have been direct purchases. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo: So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the [second] [ph] quarter of 2015 results will be held on October 22, 2015. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Anna and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, the participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : (01:20 \u2013 01:25) 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, and Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers. Our Q3 results represent the tenth consecutive quarter of delivering a minimum of 5% organic sales growth, which reflects the strength of our diversified model and our commitment to achieving revenue gains at the high end of MedTech. Once again, all three business segments delivered year over year sales growth, as continued strong momentum in the U.S., which represents approximately 70% of our sales, more than offset modest constant currency gains outside the U.S. This performance was notable given the tough year over year comparisons in MedSurg. Top-line standouts in the U.S. included trauma and extremities and neurotechnology, which continued their string of double digit growth. I am also pleased with our U.S. performance in MAKO, hip, knee and spine, which are all showing good momentum since the beginning of the year; and despite tough prior year comparisons, instruments and medical continue to perform well. Katherine will discuss MAKO in more detail, which included another strong quarter of robot sales and FDA approval of the total knee application. International markets proved more challenging, as softness in China and Latin America offset strong performance in Australia and Europe, the latter which is benefiting from the launch of our Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of this year. Building on our success in Europe with this new structure, we have recently announced changes to our leadership model in other regions of the world. These changes will be effective in 2016, and will drive stronger engagement with the regions and our product divisions. We believe these changes will enable us to accelerate international growth over time, although we do expect the market conditions in emerging markets to remain challenging into 2016. Turning to the P&L, we drove leverage through improving gross margin, ongoing focus on G&A and a lower tax rate, owing to the establishment of our European regional headquarters. As a result, we have been able to continue to make key investments in R&D and sales and marketing to help sustain our top-line momentum while ensuring we are achieving our financial targets. Our adjusted EPS for Q3 of $1.25 represents an increase of approximately 9% versus prior year, which is at the high end of our targeted range of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. With three solid quarters now complete, we are well positioned to meet our full year sales and revised adjusted earnings guidance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on MAKO, with a particular emphasis on our planned rollout of our triathlon total knee on the MAKO robot. Firstly, with respect to the quarter, we sold another record level for Q3, with 17 robots globally in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 41. These robot sales represented a nice mix of existing and competitive accounts, while also reflecting both direct purchases and lease agreements through our Flex Financial Group. Looking at the total knee, recall that we received FDA clearance in August for this key robotic indication, which we believe will drive considerable differentiation in the reconstructive market. Momentum continues to build for the MAKO total hip and the Uni has gained considerable market share. Beyond these indications, we have a high degree of conviction regarding the opportunity for the robot with the total knee, which we anticipate will enable us to drive market share gains following full commercial release. Against that backdrop, we wanted to provide greater visibility regarding the launch of the total knee, as we focus a significant amount of our time and effort on the front end to enable an optimal physician and patient experience. Given the anticipated impact of the total knee, we are committed to extensive training with our 1,000-plus sales force as well as our surgeon partners. We also will look to collect data that will further strengthen the value proposition as we analyze the ability of the robot to positively impact a number of clinical and economic outcomes. The initial phase of our launch, which will get underway late this year, will target a small group of existing robotic users who represent the key opinion leaders in the surgeon community. This will help drive a database of outcomes that will allow for a presence at key podium presentations beginning in 2017. We will also target current non-robotic surgeons who are also KOLs and have extensive experience with our triathlon total knee. By observing outcomes for both groups, we will be able to enhance the training protocols prior to full market launch. A broader market release will get underway in the second half of 2016, setting the stage for full commercialization as we head into 2017. Note that beyond this critical training and stage release, there is considerable support being provided as we upgrade the existing robots in the field to enable for total knee placement. In sum, we're committed to leveraging our leadership in reconstructive surgery to help ensure that this transformative technology for total knee replacement has an optimal rollout, while setting the stage to collect key data that will further validate its value. As we have stated previously, our approach to market launch will limit the revenue impact for this indication in 2016. However, we anticipate we will be on a path to demonstrating market share gains in total knees beginning in 2017. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 1.3% in the third quarter, including a negative 4.6% impact from foreign translation. Constant currency sales growth was 5.9%, which includes organic growth of 5.3%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the third quarter were $0.79 per share versus $0.16 last year in the third quarter, while adjusted EPS was $1.25 per share for the quarter versus $1.15 in the third quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.06 per share from FX, in line with our guidance. Most foreign exchange rates were again weaker against the dollar than last year in the same period. The weaker Euro and Swiss Franc along with our layered hedging program helped mitigate some of the impact in the quarter, as many of our products are manufactured within Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rate in the period. However, significant currency weakening within the emerging market regions and general weakness in the Japanese Yen, Australian and Canadian Dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relates to a charge of approximately $149 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions more refined. Looking at our sales in the third quarter, our organic growth of 5.3% was comprised of a positive 6.6% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.3%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 4.6% impact on sales in the quarter. Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopaedic products were up 0.3% as reported, and grew 5.8% constant currency, and increased 5.5% organically. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9% in the quarter, despite facing tough comps in all three of our Orthopaedic businesses. Trauma and Extremities had another standout quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 15%, including Foot and Ankle organic growth of nearly 20%. U.S. Hips continued its strong performance and grew 5.7% in the third quarter, while U.S. Knees increased 5% compared to last year. Internationally, sales were a negative 0.4% in Hips in constant currency, and increased 0.2% in Knees in constant currency, resulting from tougher macro market issues in China and Brazil. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 0.6% as reported, with 4.1% in constant currency, and increased 2.8% organically. These results include mid-single digit constant currency growth in our Medical and Instrument businesses, as we begin to go up against strong double digit sales growth periods. Endoscopy grew up by 1.4% in constant currency, as customers await our new camera launch late in the fourth quarter. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 19% of our sales in the quarter, increased 5% as reported, and 9.9% organically. Growth in this segment was led by strong double digit growth in Neurovascular and NSE. And CMF increased high single digit, and Spine sales increased low single digit in the quarter, including mid-single digits in the U.S. In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2015 were 66.9%, compared to 65.7% in the third quarter last year. The increase in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year resulted from favorable FX, product mix and operational efficiencies, partially offset by continued pricing declines. Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales in both the third quarter of 2014 and 2015. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $862 million, or 35.6% of sales in the quarter versus 35.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven in part by our decision to reinvest roughly half of our tax savings to strengthen our selling and marketing activities and support our new European regional headquarter. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses again in 2016, as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 24.9% in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2014. The rate reflects strong gross profit rate, partially offset by the impact of negative price and our investments to support our European business and sales team. Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $33 million, which includes higher net interest expense and FX transaction losses in the period. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 12.8%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 16.4%. This compares to a 19.9% adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter last year. The tax rate this quarter brings our adjusted rate to 17.5% on a year-to date-basis. We still expect the extenders to be approved late in the fourth quarter; however, if not approved, it would negatively impact our full-year per share earnings guidance by $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 30% of it held in the U.S. We also had $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the third quarter at 56, consistent with last year's third quarter, and days in inventory finished the quarter at 187 days, slightly higher than the 182 days in the third quarter of last year. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first nine months of 2015 were $228 million, compared to $1.1 billion last year in the first nine months. Capital expenditures were $191 million in the first nine months of 2015, compared to $172 million in the same period last year. As mentioned last quarter, we did make significant payments this year associated with our Rejuvenate settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from the OUS cash. Also, as we previously mentioned, we have repatriated approximately $700 million in the first nine months of the year and expect to repatriate nearly $1 billion more late in the year. We still have approximately $2 billion available for share repurchases under our expanded authorization, as approximately $446 million of share repurchases were made in the first nine months. We continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next two to three years. Our strong third quarter results give us additional confidence in our ability to deliver improved operating results for the year. Our sales guidance continues to be constant currency growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 4%. Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be down 1.5% to 2% for the company moving forward, relatively consistent with the pricing environment we have experienced over the last year. We expect that our adjusted tax rate for all of 2015 and in 2016 will be in the 17% to 18% range. Also keep in mind that the potential benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year-end guidance, and represents approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share for the year. Based on current FX rates, we still expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 per share for the year, and again keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge. And finally, we are narrowing our earnings guidance for 2015 to $5.07 to $5.12. Thanks again for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Moderator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question. The first question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the Orthopaedic trends that you're seeing in the United States. It was a very good quarter across the board for the business and particularly within the Hip and Knee franchise. Just wondering if you're seeing early benefits just from MAKO and just being out there and talking through having the system, or if you're seeing just kind of any acceleration in the market or just some disruption from some competitors that are out there? Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kristen. This is Kevin. Look, we're very pleased with the quarter, both in Hips, Knees, as well as MAKO. I would say that the team has done a terrific job in driving organic growth within Hips and Knees. Hips you've seen for the last three years we've been driving terrific performance. We're very pleased with the Knee momentum that we're seeing, and I think we got a bit of a shot in the arm with the launch of our cones, our 3D-printed cones for revisions. But it's been momentum building throughout the year. It's just really strong leadership, strong execution. The robot sales, of course, help. I wouldn't say that we've seen much in the way of disruption, so this is really more just driving organic growth and really building throughout the course of the year. Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just in terms of the comments for outside the United States, with some disruption between China and Latin America, any level of visibility in terms of when that would turn around? Or, I guess just \u2013 for now \u2013 just expect that to continue into 2016? I guess that's the takeaway. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, in my opening remarks I mentioned into 2016. I don't have a crystal ball, so it's really difficult to predict when the macro conditions will improve. We referred to capital equipment being particularly tough last quarter. We did see that spill over into implants, with distributors starting to lower their inventory levels, and we really don't have great visibility into how long it will last. I think it will certainly continue through the fourth quarter and into 2016, but it's something we're going to have to update you on as each quarter unfolds. Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But Europe is turning around with the help of the Transatlantic model? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Europe had a terrific quarter. A really excellent \u2013 we're in the sort of mid-single digit growth in Europe, and overall, you know Europe GDP is not growing at that rate, so we're very pleased with our performance in Europe and expect that to continue. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Kevin, I wanted to come back to SG&A for a second here. I think incrementally, across the year, I feel like the company has talked about more material opportunities for SG&A reduction. Can you give us a sense of what that opportunity is, perhaps the size of the opportunity, when we could hear more about it? And a related question for Bill \u2013 what's a reasonable level of leverage we can expect sort of going forward here at this level of sales? I think last quarter you told us maybe 40 basis points. What's an appropriate level as we think about 2016? And I had a quick follow-up for Katherine. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, all three of us. So I'll start. David, we've been working all year on plans around SG&A. We've taken a number of measures already, and we're working on evaluating some more significant measures. We still have significant scope for improvement in SG&A. We've talked before about the fact that we have very little in the way of shared services. We have many IT systems across our disparate organization. So there are significant opportunities. I'm not yet ready to quantify that and discuss that with you. Once we reach that stage, we will definitely tell you. We will be very thoughtful, as we were with GQO. We gave you a five-year road map with the amount of savings planned over that five-year period. You should expect to hear something like that related to SG&A, but we're just not ready yet and I don't want to speculate on exactly when we'll be ready to communicate. But work is ongoing, and it will be something you will hear in the not too distant future. William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : And just as a general comment associated with the leverage expectations, pretty consistent with what we were talking about before. So if you're seeing kind of this mid-single digit sales growth, we believe we can grow our broad based operating margins kind of in the 20 to 40 basis points, 30 to 40 basis points range on an average basis over a three- four-year period of time. I think that that's pretty consistent with our expectations, and if you look at where that should come from, price is a key factor. So as we mentioned in the past, as price is kind of still up close to around the 2% range, we'd expect very little improvements at the gross margin level, and most of that would really be taking place through the SG&A related leverage. If price is 1.5% or less, which we don't expect \u2013 we expect it to be in the 1.5% to 2% range \u2013 but if it was less than that, we would expect to be able to drop some through at the gross margin level. And obviously if the price went above 2%, then we think that that could cause some detrimation (23:57) to the overall gross margin rate, but the operating margin rate would still be able to provide some level of leverage. Next year, on the SG&A side of the equation, as we talked about before, this year we had heavy investments for both the RHQ structure to support our tax and some of our new sales and marketing related efforts with the TOM model, but we do expect to get good leverage out of the SG&A category next year to be able to deliver on those results. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we can. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good afternoon. First question, Kevin, I just wanted to follow up on the emerging markets. Interesting that you'd see it spill off into implants. I know you don't have a lot of visibility, but what's your best estimate right now from what you're hearing from the field in terms of why this is happening? Is it simply just the economies over there or just any other color would be appreciated. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean what we're seeing is \u2013 certainly in Brazil \u2013 it's a market slowdown, complete slowdown in the market, and that's obviously the biggest country we have in Latin America, and so it's both capital equipment as well as implants. In China, we saw capital equipment slowing down earlier in the year. This quarter, we saw implants starting to slow down. And it really, as far as we can tell, is related to macro concerns, and the distributors are just nervous. They're worried about their cash flow. And so, it's not something that I think will continue indefinitely, but it's something that we saw, certainly in certain parts of our business. We see it in Spine and Trauma more acutely than we saw it in Hips and Knees, but it was pretty broad based, and that's something we'll continue to monitor. But I don't have great visibility, honestly, into how long it will last. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then the second question. Kevin, I'd love you to comment on capital allocation. We haven't seen a lot of deals from you guys. Just talk about the environment there. And then also if you don't mind, just talk about your confidence as you look at your business going forward into next year, confidence in being able to continue to grow the top line in that 5% to 6% area. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Bob. First of all I'll start with the second part of your question. I feel very good about the health of our business overall, with the one exception of the emerging markets, which I think will continue to be difficult. If I look at just across our businesses, the management teams we have in place, our ability to execute, we've had 10 quarters in a row of at least 5%, and I do believe it's sustainable. Like every year, in 2016 we're going to have our share of tailwinds and headwinds, but \u2013 and we'll give our guidance in January as you know \u2013 but I feel very good about our execution, our management teams and our ability to consistently deliver strong sales growth. Now, related to \u2013 what was the first part of the question \u2013 on capital allocation? I would tell you, you know that all of our divisions have BD people that are out looking at targets. I would say there are plenty of targets that are out there. We haven't closed very many deals, at least, not as many this year as we have in the past couple of years. But that's not a function of lack of targets. It's just making sure that the valuations work, and that the deals are going to be value-creating for Stryker. So as you know, M&A is difficult to predict in terms of timing, but we do feel that there are a significant number of attractive targets out there and our teams continue to work on that. And that does continue to be our first priority in terms of using cash. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan, please go ahead. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. I just want to follow-up on some of the questions that have already been asked. So first question would be can you peel the onion a little bit more on the OUS performance? I mean, you've talked about Brazil really slowing down, and Europe, you said, was still mid-single digits. Do you have any geographic breakdown, whether it's developed world versus emerging markets or Europe versus Latin America versus Asia? Any other insight you could give us? Because U.S. looks great this quarter, obviously with the Ortho business. International barely grew, so some more color there would be great. And then the second point of follow-up, you talked about the 20 to 40 basis points of expected annual margin expansion. I just want to be clear. Is that what our expectation should be for 2016 or do you think you can do better than that next year based on what you're working on? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Hey, Mike, it's Katherine. I'll take the first part of the question. International really was very much driven in terms of the headwinds we were facing by China and Brazil, and it was really an extension of some of the trends that we saw in the second quarter. With China, it was capital has been challenged there, given that's government self-pay, but with some of the pull-back we have seen that impact the implant business as well. And then in Brazil, with the country in a recession, that has impacted that business. So really outside the U.S., it's very much China and Brazil that are pulling down the numbers. Europe, with the Transatlantic Operating Model, we're really seeing very good momentum. I think Kevin cited the mid-single digit growth we're seeing there, and stronger performance in other geographies like Japan and Australia. So really, I would say it's very much isolated to the emerging markets of China and Brazil. Bill, do you want to? William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Sure, on the operating margin side of the equation, as I mentioned before, we are generally comfortable with kind of that 20, 40 basis point improvement moving forward. We think our businesses are structured in a good way to deliver that. A key part of that is based on price and also based on our top line sales growth. Kevin mentioned, or alluded to, at least, being comfortable with kind of something in the same type of sales growth range, even for next year. If we deliver in that type of a range, we would still expect to get reasonable operating margin leverage off of that. We have not given any guidance, obviously, for 2016. We'll have to take a look at kind of where FX is as well as the markets are at that point in time, and we'll give better guidance with our next call. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, Bill, just one follow-up to that. So just on FX, do you have a sense at this point, assuming no change in rates, what the FX spillover would be to the bottom line next year? Like, what incremental headwind you'd have in 2016 to earnings versus 2015? William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Yeah, I'd say that right now based on where current rates are at, we would only expect maybe somewhere in the $0.05 range of a negative impact for next year, but again, it depends on where rates change over the next quarter on what we look at and when we give our guidance. But that's probably a reasonable range at this point. Operator : And our next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. Back to MAKO, Katherine, you talked about opening current new accounts. You came in a couple of systems better than I was looking for. And just in talking about the new accounts, it's early I know, but can you give us a little perspective? Are these new accounts impacting share? Are you seeing pull-through? How/when do we start to see that? And I assume that MAKO should have another good fourth quarter. I assume you expect fourth quarters to be typically normally seasonally strong. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, with all of our capital businesses, the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter and MAKO would be no exception on that matter, so we would expect a solid fourth quarter. I think it's just too early. Clearly, the Knee indication has sparked a lot of interest in the clinical community and there's a lot of excitement around it. But I think at this point, how early we are in starting to roll out and in fact that we're in really the training stages, and not being in full commercial release until late next year, it's just too early to say. I think what you're seeing on the organic Hip and Knee performance in the U.S. is a lot of good execution, certainly bolstered by MAKO, but MAKO isn't having the impact, for example, on our Knee or Hip momentum that we would expect to see particularly with the former as we head into 2017. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And, Kevin, maybe my second one for you, can you talk a little bit more, give us a little more color on some of your comments today? You talked about some of the OUS. leadership changes. Can you maybe give us a little more detail about some of the specific changes you're making, some of the specific marching orders you're giving the new team? Where you've done these things I think they've had an impact. What are you looking for and what results should we expect over the next year or so? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so what we've done and we announced during the quarter that we are phasing out the role of the Group President of International. So that's a role that Stryker's had for a long time, and we're eliminating that position. And as a result, the other regions are going to report directly into our businesses. It's a big change for Stryker. It's going to enable us to be much more closely connected, to have the regions very, very closely connected to our product divisions. That's what we saw as the key benefit with Europe. I could tell you that movement in Europe is ahead of our expectations. And so, this is a natural evolution of this Transatlantic model. We knew that we wanted to get Europe done first. We had the biggest opportunity for share gains are in Europe. That did accompany some investment. We don't necessarily feel that we need to make the same degree of investments in other countries, but we saw the benefit of that region to product connection, and we know that that'll also drive value in other markets of the world. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is actually Yong Lee (33:50) in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess regarding MAKO, a strong system number this quarter. Just wondering what's the breakdown between purchase system versus financing? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : We don't break out the mix, although I would say it's still dominated by purchases, but there's a decent component of leases as well. And that's really aided by our Flex Financial Group that's been around for a number of years now and exists throughout all our capital businesses within MedSurg as well as Ortho. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great, thanks. And on Foot and Ankle, the growth is strong, nearly 20%. Is that largely market growth or are you starting to take some share? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say that the market continues to be a very attractive segment. We're doing well in the market. We're very pleased with the SBI acquisition we did a year ago, which rounded out our portfolio. But you've seen over the past three years, we've been experiencing great growth. I would say it's primarily market driven, but in some cases we are taking market share. But I would first look at the market as being the major driver. Unknown Speaker : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Miksic from UBS. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we can. William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Yes. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking our questions. So a couple of follow-ups on some of the topics that folks have hit on already. One, MAKO, you talked about the uptick in Hip and Unis. Maybe Katherine, or if you could talk a little bit about what kind of traction maybe? Any color you can give on the kind of traction you're seeing with Hips? And I have one follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I would say just reflected, and as we continue to place more robots sequentially, you're seeing the impact it's having with our very large sales force out there, articulating the benefits of using a Hip in both robotic. They don't need to establish a lot of credibility in market share in Uni so the gains there are less significant. But in Hips, having our sales force well into the integration now being able to articulate the benefits has really helped drive that adoption. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Any impact of some new software or new applications? I know you're probably on version two or three or four now in terms of the system. Anything there that's starting to make things a little easier for folks? Or any color? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, I think any time we do any improvements, it certainly helps. But I think the biggest factor is having our considerable sales force obviously much, much larger in size out there, aligned and coordinated with their MAKO counterparts, going into hospitals. And those are both our own customers, as well as competitive accounts, and being able to place a robot and then drive the adoption obviously with Uni and Hips. And then as we go forward, the economic value proposition only improves as you start to layer in the Knee. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then on Spine, appreciate the Q&A and access last week in going through some of the new products. The business is still obviously not, I would assume, where you want it in terms of growth perspective. What can we look for there in terms of catalysts to sort of get that moving? Is it launches? Is it sales force? Is it strategic activity? Any color would be helpful. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, we're really pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the Spine business. And that really is several years of increased investment in R&D. We have a terrific R&D leader in there, who I think you saw last week at NAS. We've launched something like 10 new products in the last six months. That's more than we've launched in the last two years, collectively. And we have a nice pipeline of new products slated to be launched as we're going forward, so we're going to focus on R&D, driving innovation, and optimizing the sales force and that's all the things that the current leadership is executing on. So, that will be the focus. There's no magic bullet here, but we're going to continue to look at that and clearly pleased with the impact some of those products are having. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, certainly you've seen the numbers in the U.S. pick up and we're encouraged about the U.S. We have work to do outside the United States. A lot of those products have not yet been registered. We haven't launched many products including the CoAlign acquisition, which has given us a shot in the arm in the U.S. We're just working through all the manufacturing transition into Stryker. So, the product tail does lag a little bit outside the U.S. We have work to do there, and certainly OUS was also impacted by the slowdown both in China and Brazil. So, not pleased with the OUS results, but very pleased with the momentum in the U.S. and as we launch those products outside the U.S., I would expect the OUS business to pick up. Operator : And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one has to do with cross-selling amongst your portfolio and what you're seeing in terms of being able to leverage your Orthopaedic as well as the other areas. And then the second question has to do more broadly with any changes at the CMS level for the pilot program for bundled payment, what you think that may or may not impact your business. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I'll take the first question. I would say cross-selling is something that we do wherever we believe that the customer is interested in dealing across our businesses. So the area that we tend to see this the most is in Neurotechnology, where our customers will express an interest for a Neurotechnology offer, and then our divisions will then work together collectively. So it's generally in response to a customer request. It's not something that we do proactively and that we're pushing from the center. It's really in response to customer needs. But our divisions work extremely well together. Katherine cited an example of Flex Financial which is a unit that sits inside of our MedSurg group that helps MAKO sell robots within our Orthopaedic group. So collaboration does work very, very well at Stryker, but it's something that tends to be very based on customer needs, and not pushed from the center. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : And then, Joanne, with respect to your second question, I would say that since this is really not new to the industry, really more moving over the next few years within Medicare to a mandatory, what you tend to see in this situation is a much bigger focus on the post-acute care, particularly patients that are discharged to rehab because the dollars there and the opportunities for cost savings are much, much greater than any of the other areas. So what we've seen is they tend to focus there is significant disparity around the U.S. in terms of what patients are sent home versus those that go directly to rehab. And we'd expect that trend to continue. Doesn't mean pricing pressure isn't going to go away. We just don't believe that's going to be a trigger to change dramatically the pricing backdrop within the implants. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I had two follow-up questions on Spine. Kevin, the U.S. Spine number came in better than we thought, and I'm just curious, is that a function of a stronger Spine market in the U.S.? In other words, better unit growth, less payer pushback and pricing pressure? Or is this market share gains given your new product rollouts? And then as a follow-up, in the past, Kevin, you've talked about wanting to grow Spine organically and inorganically. Given the strength of the current pipeline, should we start to assume that internal development is the way you're going to go versus M&A? Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, first thing I'd say is the Spine market's been a pretty stable market over the last couple of years, and so I don't believe the market is suddenly improving magically. I would say the last two quarters we've been very pleased with our performance in the U.S., and we believe that's because of the new products that we're launching and that we're growing faster than the market. Now, of course, not everybody has reported yet, so we won't have a full picture on our share gains in this quarter until everyone else reports. Related to the organic versus inorganic, we're very pleased with growing our business organically. That's always the best way to drive value in our businesses. And as it relates to inorganic, all of our divisions are constantly looking for acquisitions. I certainly don't feel compelled to do a deal, because you can see we're posting nice growth with our organic performance. But we're always on the lookout for acquisitions. But that's not unique to Spine; that applies to all of our divisions. Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And next question is from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask a bit about MAKO, and you laid out your plans over the next couple of years in terms of collecting data before you go broader with the technology. And I'm curious as you start to think about the data and where you think the opportunities are to present the compelling case to hospitals to adopt it, is it primarily going to be focused on efficiencies and hospitals running their practices more efficiently? Or will it be focused on patient satisfaction, or perhaps both? Anything you could give us on that would be helpful. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, sure, Raj. I think as you think about what we said in terms of the early launch, was we're really looking at observational outcomes with both existing robotic and non-robotic users, but really focusing on the key opinion leaders who really have a presence at the podium. And we're going to be evaluating everything from implant positioning, adverse events, ligament releases, patient satisfaction, that's going to be a lot of the initial focus. Absolutely over time we'll be developing, I'm sure, more robust clinical evaluations or trials, but right now that's going to be the focus initially. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : So less on the cost side it sounds like initially in terms of hospitals being able to do orthopaedics more efficiently or cheaper. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I think that's something that will come over time as surgeons move up the learning curve and gain greater experience. But given a very limited launch early on as we look to optimize the training protocol, that won't be the focus. Operator : Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I want to just start with a strategic question, and Kevin, this does relate to your comments around emerging markets. I think if we look back a few years, those regions represented a significant priority for you as some of the U.S. businesses were a little bit more sluggish. But maybe in the context of what you're seeing today, can you maybe just help us understand where you're prioritizing your investments? And as you think about those investments, where should we expect to see the greatest return within your business? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, sure. Right now, emerging markets represent about 8% of Stryker's sales, and that's clearly below MedTech. It's not a bad time to be less exposed to emerging markets, but that doesn't mean we aren't committed for the long term. Our India business is doing well. China will be an important market for the future, so certainly we're not going to invest at the same rate that we've invested the last couple years while we weather the current storm. But we are in it for the long term and we do plan to grow in emerging markets. It's just \u2013 we had planned previously to be a little bit more aggressive in areas like Russia and Turkey. That's currently not a good a use of our investment right now, so we'll sort of hit the pause button in those countries. And then as the market conditions improve, we'll dial up the investments. Very pleased with the investments we made in Europe; those are driving terrific returns. As an overall company, we do want to grow our business outside the United States. Our strong U.S. business continues to perform very well, and we do plan to grow outside the U.S., and that's why the Operating Model changes are extending even beyond Europe to include the other countries of the world, because I think that direct connection to our product divisions will drive growth everywhere else outside the United States. And Europe is very instructive. What we've seen in Europe we know we can replicate in other countries. David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, then maybe just a follow-up from maybe a combination of a macro and a micro question. If you look at some of the businesses in which you operate, whether it's some of the MedSurg business or procedure volume, exposed areas, we have seen a nice pickup in growth. And while, clearly, you have some new product momentum in those areas, how much do you think of the growth we're seeing is a catch-up from prior periods of some headwinds versus what might be entering kind of a new normal steady state growth rate for some of those franchises? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm not sure what catch-up you're referring to, because if you look at the last year's third quarter, we had knee growth of 6.8%, hip growth of 18.1%, trauma 15.3%. So we're posting strong growth this quarter on the backs of pretty strong growth in the prior year. So for 10 quarters \u2013 consecutive quarters of over 5% organic growth \u2013 it's not like we're catching the tail of periods of slow growth. We're posting consistent, steady, strong growth. Now, from quarter to quarter there's some variation between businesses, but overall, this is a very steady growth story that you're seeing at Stryker. I'm not sure I understand the question, or if it's a specific business you're referring to, because on an overall basis, we're posting growth on top of prior growth quarters that were pretty strong. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Keeler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking the questions. First, can you help us think about the MAKO total knee opportunity? You talked about MAKO success in Uni and the share gains \u2013 I think 17% over four years. Once the total knee is launched starting in 2017, do you see the potential for a similar magnitude of share ramp going forward from there? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, we haven't quantified the targeted gains. We have been very clear that we do expect, once it's in full commercial release, to begin to get on a trajectory to gain meaningful market share, and we would expect to be on that trajectory in 2017. I wouldn't be assuming quite that level of share gains, but we also want to get some experience under our belt. This is brand new to the industry, and \u2013 but we're really excited about the impact it will have in terms of driving share gain in 2017. I think as we get closer to that timeframe and we think about setting our targets for 2017, we'll be able to have a better sense of what that could practically mean. Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. And just I'll stick with MAKO. As you invest in training next year as you get the launch underway, do you expect that to be a drag at all on margins ahead of when you're fully launched in 2017? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : No, I think you should just assume that'll be contemplated within our normal spend. Operator : And our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me. One on MedSurg. One on Neurovascular. Starting with MedSurg, the growth has slowed a little bit this year. I know you talked about a new camera, I think in Q4, in endoscopy. Could you just talk about just when \u2013 how long it will take to kind of re-accelerate the growth across MedSurg, and some of the other kind of new product cycles we should be thinking about? And I had one follow-up. Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, so the first thing I'd say about our MedSurg businesses is they had an absolutely huge quarter in the third quarter of last year. If you look back at the numbers that we posted, close to 20% growth in a number of our \u2013 of those businesses \u2013 so very tough comps. And we're very pleased with our Medical division and expect them to continue to perform very well. Endoscopy, certainly we've had a few challenges related to the Berchtold integration. That's starting to pick up steam, and I'm feeling very optimistic about that. That camera launch, it's sort of the end of the 1488 camera cycle; we're moving to the 1588 platform. That will be launched toward the end of this year, and certainly there was a little bit of a delay in orders as people are anticipating that launch. The one product area that is later in its cycle is our system 7 power tools, within instruments, but if you look at the instruments numbers, they continue to post pretty strong results throughout the rest of their portfolio. But that's one area as you look into 2016 where you can anticipate maybe a little bit of a moderating of growth as it gets towards the latter part of their cycle. But they have another range of products that they can sell, and they're performing very well. So I would tell you I'm very pleased with our MedSurg performance. I know that the absolute growth in this quarter looks a little smaller, but again, on the back of an outstanding third quarter of last year. It's not like our business is slowing down or that we're losing momentum or losing share. I feel like we have very, very solid businesses that will continue to perform well. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Kevin. And then on neurotech and Neurovascular, the growth's obviously been very strong recently. Can you help tease out how much of that growth is from the Trevo benefiting from the new stroke data versus your coils and flow diverters also growing? And any update just on how the stroke market is evolving since all the new positive data earlier this year? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, well, I would start by saying when you look at our portfolio it does address both hemorrhagic and ischemic, but the majority of the revenue is still driven on the hemorrhagic side, which is going to be the coils and related accessories where we're seeing growth. Ischemic growth is certainly outpacing that, but it's a much smaller market at this point in time. And it's certainly benefiting from data, whether it's the MR CLEAN study that showed using stent retrievers, including the majority of the retrievers used in that device was our own, absolutely have a benefit on patients, and this was further enhanced with the AHA guidelines that came out earlier in their year. So that data is really underscoring the benefits of these devices that are the only devices that have clinical data supporting their use in ischemic patients. So growth there is much faster, but obviously off a much smaller base. Operator : And our next question is from Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hi, everyone. This is GP (51:57) in for Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I had one on just the competitive landscape that you're seeing in maybe Hips and Knees, especially with kind of new entrants into the market and maybe other large integrations with Zimmer Biomet there, if you're seeing any displacements or distractions? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : There really haven't been any new entrants into the Hip and Knee market. The competitive backdrop has been very stable. I think as we think about the merger between Biomet and Zimmer, they're obviously a considerable player in the market. We haven't seen them report Q3 results, so like you, we're at a disadvantage. We feel very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business. We have said it's usually a few quarters in before you really get a sense if any dissynergies are tracking above or below what they anticipate, but we're really focused on our business. We have got a great portfolio of products. Obviously, the MAKO and the new indication we see as a huge benefit. We'll see what happens to them, but really the focus right now is gaining traction with our own customers and using MAKO to get into some competitive accounts. Unknown Speaker : Great. And if I could just ask one on MAKO, if you think about the pipeline of new indications that you're kind of looking at in your R&D, what's next? Should we think about maybe a shoulder or maybe moving into spine? But just trying to see what you have there. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I would say when you think about it, right now, essentially all of our focus is on the recon market. I can't underscore enough the amount of time and energy that's being put into the total knee launch to make sure it is executed as close to flawlessly as possible. We do think that is the biggest indication and can have considerable impact on the market. I think there will be downstream applications in other areas of joints, whether it's in the shoulder or in the spine, but that is multi years away from where our focus is right now. Operator : And our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Foot and Ankle business. It was up 20% or so in the quarter, and how much of that is sustainable over time, given what the current competitive dynamic is versus maybe the underlying market growth? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so new markets are often difficult to predict, right? So when we created our Foot and Ankle business unit a few years ago, I really didn't expect that the market would be this big and that the growth would be this high. So it's been a fantastic business unit for us, performing extremely well mostly with organic growth. We had, obviously, the SBI acquisition as well. The market still seems to be very hot. There's still a lot of surgeons that are increasing their volumes, and more and more surgeons getting trained. So we do believe that this will be a high growth market for the foreseeable future. Now, whether it stays up at the 20% or starts to moderate, I'm not sure, but we're not really concerned about competitive dynamics. We have a great product portfolio, very strong sales force execution, and when you're riding market growth and you've got the products and the sales force, it's a good place to be. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. Maybe the first one on MAKO, Katherine I guess. Can you characterize the types of accounts that are purchasing the system right now or is it possible to do so? Any certain types of characteristics, academic centers, community hospitals? And then also, what percentage of your installed base or new systems over the last few quarters are going to multisystem accounts? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : That, the latter, very small. And it really covers the entire range; we're seeing all sorts of customers out there. I wouldn't be able to characterize it as one specific type of hospital. We have some hospitals with one robot, some with multi. We have some that were existing customers, some that are competitive customers, some that are buying the robots, some that are leasing the robots. So it really is the full range. There's not one specific characteristic that I would point to. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thanks. And then Kevin, just going back to M&A, obviously there's been quite a bit of turmoil in health care equity markets. Valuations look like they've been pulling back. To the extent that \u2013 were valuations in any way potentially something that was slowing down the process for you guys as you've looked around? And does this kind of recent pullback make things more attractive from your seat? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, M&A, the timing of M&A is always difficult to predict. And valuations is one factor; it's not always the only factor. We also have issues sometimes around quality, of remediation that's required. Sometimes it's cultural fit, so there's always a range of issues that we go through when we're looking at a target, and as we get under the covers and do due diligence, then we sort of figure out whether we really want to move forward or not. Valuation clearly is always one of the factors, but I wouldn't say suddenly, just because we have a temporary market pullback that the companies are ready to sell to us at a much lower price. So, I think it will take a little time for that to settle in, but clearly, valuations is one of the factors that we look at and one of the reasons that we won't move forward. But it's not the only reason. Operator : And our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot. One question on MAKO first. Can you just talk about the robotic competitive landscape that you're seeing from direct competition, Omni or Blue Belt, and then how you see that evolving now with the total knee application approved? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I tell you that we're not focused at all on the competition. We really don't see Blue Belt as a fully robotic solution. It's really, in our view, it's an enhanced navigation system. It doesn't have the type of features that our system has. So we really believe we're alone in the purely true robotic space, and we have a long runway ahead of us. And we're really not concerned with the competition. Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, and just a follow-up for Bill. You had some discussion about opportunities for operating margin expansion. Any chance you can give us some more details on where you see those opportunities in the different business units? Are there more opportunity in recon versus Neurotechnology versus MedSurg? Any further detail would be great. Thanks a lot. William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Sure, so I mean, one, we don't break that down externally at all. But I mean, you should expect that any of our businesses that are seeing mid-digit plus kind of organic level growth, we would expect to get reasonably good operating margin improvements on that over time. And based on the market growth dynamics in different geographies and/or in aggregate for a business, if the growth rates are down in the lower single digit range, you probably shouldn't expect really any operating margin improvements. As that goes up though, we should definitely get operating margin leverage in almost any of our businesses. And I think that, in general, that's what we're driving to achieve over a two to three year period of time, on average. Operator : And our next question is from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thanks. So two brief questions, one on MAKO. How long were the cost or time associated with updating those to accommodate the total knee into your current number of systems out in the field? And then second question for Bill, just on the gross margin, that was a huge increase. And I know you gave us the reasons, FX mix and efficiencies offset by price, but I was wondering if you could quantify those. And then how much of that \u2013 are we at a new level \u2013 we're going to be 50 bps, 100 bps higher going forward? Or will we just drop back down to where we were in the first half of this year and this is kind of a one quarter gain just because we had the big U.S. quarter? Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, Bill, just \u2013 I want to make sure I'm understanding the question \u2013 you're saying how long it takes to physically upgrade an existing account to the new indication, to the new robot? The software and the related hardware components? William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Well, It's really just how long will it take until you're through to update all the units in the field? Is that, like, through 2016, you'll be done by the end of the year? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I would say at the end of 2016, we feel like we'll be in a very good position to go into a full commercial launch and we won't be limited by the need to upgrade existing customers. You're always bringing on new customers, but that's part of the reason to have a very measured, controlled rollout, is to make sure that we're in a position really to put the pedal down when we go into full commercial launch. William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : As far as the gross margin rate question is concerned, so yes, it was a very good quarter, as I mentioned, really in the early part of this year, both in the first and second quarter. We talked that our gross margin rates were going to improve as we moved into the third and even in the fourth quarter of this year. Our expectation maybe from a breakdown of some of the categories, so two of the biggest impacts in this quarter are FX and mix, and maybe a little bit on the pricing, since pricing was only at 1.3% for us. But FX and mix were probably, if you look at the total improvement, they're probably each in the 50 basis point plus range as far as the impacts that they have. Keep in mind that a lot of our products are manufactured in Europe, so as the European or the Euro currencies have been declining this year and the U.S. has stayed strong, we've actually continued to get improved gross margin rates from FX, despite the fact that FX on the bottom line at the EPS level has actually been negative for us. And then, same thing on the mix side. I think that you should expect both of those to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. And then you should look more from an anniversary perspective that the improvements that we'd expect next year would be relatively modest at the gross margin level, but we'll get into that as we announce our overall expectations for the year. Generally, if price is at the upper end or in the 1.7%, 1.8% to 2% range, we'd expect our gross margins to be relatively flat in that kind of an environment. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2015 results will be held on January 26, 2016. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have an opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations and Glenn Boehnlein will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers. With a 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving topline growth at the high end of MedTech. This marks the eleventh consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth demonstrating strong consistency over time. Our diversified sales footprint has once again proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine posted good results in the quarter. These performances underscore the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investment and a focus and disciplined M&A effort. Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which once again led growth, hosting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I\u2019m also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe including strong Q4 results benefiting from the shift for the Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015. We are building on the success as we start 2016 with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents since Tim Scannell and David Floyd. Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was once again impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we've demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness to strengthen our larger markets. Turning to earnings, our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56, primarily driven by the strong topline. The balance of the P&L came in as expected which Bill will cover in his section. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year. In addition the two year suspension of the Med Device Tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments and will help drive sales growth and innovation as we plan to invest the majority of this temporary benefit. We\u2019re also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies which is multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we've been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization. As we shift into 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President Lonny Carpenter. We've identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our plant network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we've done with direct materials moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services. Given our history of decentralization, there is considerable opportunity ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach to these efforts will allow us to preserve Stryker\u2019s competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development, while hoping to ensure we're consistently delivering P&L leverage. This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015 and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share. Finally, I would like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who has announced his plans to retire following an impressive 36-year career, the last three of which have been in Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure. In addition, he helped execute on a number of acquisitions, facilitated the establishment of our European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program. These accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and we've achieved while enabling our internal talent pool to develop including Glenn Boehnlein who has been promoted to CFO effective April 1. Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial leadership roles since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology Group. This group represents roughly half of the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I\u2019m confident in Glenn\u2019s ability and coordination with the broader financial organization to help build on our strong momentum. Before turning the call over to Katherine, I would ask Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn? Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Kevin. I appreciate the comments and the support, but I also want to thank Bill for his leadership of the finance organization over the past few years and for his commitment to helping ensure a smooth transition as I take on new responsibilities. It\u2019s a very exciting time at Stryker and I\u2019m thrilled to be part of such a great organization with so many talented and dedicated people. I\u2019m also looking forward to meeting many of our shareholders, analysts at the various events going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks Glenn. The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on MAKO. 2015 was a year of building momentum for MAKO\u2019s robotic assisted surgery as we continue to leverage our considerable sale and marketing infrastructure to help drive sales. We're particularly pleased with the increased demand for the hip indication, which has been augmented by combining the robotic technology with our proven portfolio of Stryker Hip Systems. The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant with a long term proven clinical history on a robotic assisted platform, which helps drive consistency, enhance surgeon and patient experience and we believe over time, clinically demonstrated benefits. In total we sold 31 robots globally in the quarter, 24 of which were in the U.S., which represents a solid ramp from the start of the year and a significant jump year-over-year from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2016, we're focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offers considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot license. We're also excited about the potential for the total knee indication with our flagship triathlon system. This year our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017. We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group will be in place as we head into next year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Jellison : Thanks, Katherine. I would like to start off by saying I've enjoyed working with Kevin and everyone at Stryker, especially the entire finance organization, who have made significant contributions over the last few years helping the company deliver on its financial results, coming to Stryker with a strong cultural fit and personal fit from the first week that I joined the company. We ended 2015 at the high end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives we're driving for business well for the future. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage of my life. I'll continue to engage actively in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional Board opportunities. I want to thank all of you for your support. So turning to our financial performance, sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance. Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continue to be weaker than last year in the same period. The weaker Euro and Swiss Franc along with our layered hedging program helped to mitigate some of the impacts in the quarter, as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period. However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter where amortization, restructuring changes and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recalls of the Rejuvenate ABG II Modular Hip Stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional in the period. As I've mentioned previously, the charges we've recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents a minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined. In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4% including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar, compared to the same period last year. Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7% and organic growth was 6.1%. Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported, and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S. with sales increasing 13.6%, led by strong growth in Foot and Ankle, which again grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth respectively in the quarter. Knee sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3d printed products. Our international Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency as sales growth continue to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil. However our international Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Finally we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year. Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency. Endoscopy also posted mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December. All three of these large MedSurg businesses continue to manage pricing decisions effectively with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year. Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single digit growth in the U.S. This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. spine. Spine also had a new 3D printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend. In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2%, compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates, despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share. Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year. Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. As expected these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our Transatlantic operating model. We're confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive in a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax. Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9% nearly flat compared to last year. During the year we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our Transatlantic operating model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year. Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category. Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7% while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year as we realize the benefits from our global tax structure in European regional headquarters in Amsterdam. Looking at the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55 relatively unchanged from last year. Days and inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of five days compared to last year. Turing to cash flow, our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year, but as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our rejuvenate and ABG II Recall settlement of $1.2 billion most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the rejuvenate liability is being source from OUS cash. We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015 including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year. Finally regarding share repurchases in 2015 we repurchased approximately $700 million of our current stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately of $94.67. We have authorization for another 1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization. Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter as we are still anticipating impacts of market conditions in the emerging markets especially China and Brazil. The foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels. We anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2% consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015. Due to the suspension of the MedTech tax we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total. The benefit from the suspension of the MedTech tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However R&D will run slightly higher in 2016 and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into this area offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16. As such our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure to support future growth. Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings has been offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. Finally our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter. Thanks for your support and we\u2019ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bob Hopkins : Thanks. Can you hear me okay Katherine Owen : Hi Bob. Bob Hopkins : Great, hey good afternoon. So first Bill, sorry to see you move on, but good luck with the next chapter. So it will be remised if I didn\u2019t asked a follow-up question on this announcement and may be the way to phrase the question Bill is and for Kevin and Katherine, you guys have been talking about M&A for some time. And I\u2019m just curious if this CFO transition suggests any change in strategy or maybe suggested mirror larger deals kind of less likely until after this transition is complete. Just getting curious how this could affect strategy and/or the outlook for M&A and thanks and again congrats Bill for the decision. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, thanks Bob. Look I would tell you right now the company is in very good shape. You can see the way we\u2019re performing. This is an internal transition with somebody who is inside our company. So this not like we're signaling any kind of shift in strategy. I would tell you we\u2019ve been very consistent on capital allocation since I've been in the job and even before that our approach is to favor M&A first, then dividends and then share buyback. So there is absolutely zero change to our operating mode and I\u2019m expecting a very smooth transition. You can see that we have a whole quarter of overlap and Bill is still going to be around in this community and available to help us as needed. So I would tell you that you should expect more of the same from Stryker and this should be a very seamless change. Bob Hopkins : All right, thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up also Kevin from a big picture perspective, I was wondering if you could kind of give us your sense for the outlook for hospital capital spending in 2016, what are you seeing from hospitals, you\u2019re expecting any changes? Just wanted to get a sense for your view on the 2016 outlook for CapEx especially since you\u2019re launching some new products into the market right now? Kevin Lobo : Thanks Bob. Look we see the market as very stable for capital equipment. You can see in the fourth quarter we had very strong performances on MAKO, selling capital, that\u2019s large capital. We also have a lot of small capital. Our instruments division did very well in the fourth quarter. So we look at the market as being very stable. We're just embarking upon our launch of our new camera 1588 with an endoscopy. We had a nice start in the month of December and the orders look quite healthy going into the year. So, we're not seeing really any change, a very stable capital market. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Weinstein : Thanks for taking the question. Good evening everybody and Bill my sentiments as well. Thanks for all your help and enjoy your time away from Stryker. Let me ask a couple questions guys. So one question is the 5% to 6% constant currency guidance for 2016 obviously, you've by and large have been running above that. Can you just tell us what you have baked in there for the emerging market performance because obviously you're still assuming a challenge in emerging market environment for the year? So I just want to get some sensitivity around it. Katherine Owen : Yeah, Mike in terms of emerging markets which is in that 7% to 8% of our total sales in China and Brazil are the biggest components, although we\u2019ve been seeing nice growth in markets outside of that. We've assumed those markets remain challenging for the better part of the year. China as well as Brazil were difficult to predict given the macro issue surrounding them. We do benefit from easier comparisons as we get to the back half of the year, but we assume your real market there continues to be a bit of a challenge. Kevin Lobo : Yeah Mike, I would say the emerging markets for us, we had similar performance in the fourth quarter as we did in the third quarter. So we're slightly negative in terms of growth in our emerging markets, China of course being the biggest drag and for Stryker, we have a capital equipment business especially the Endoscopy division that's quite big in China and so that has a bit more of an impact to the disposables or implants on Stryker. So we're expecting that to continue to be difficult and that will be a drag and it's certainly in the year. So we're setting our guidance from five to six. As you saw last year, we moved our guidance up during the year. If these conditions don't or are not as severe, you can expect even do the same, it doesn\u2019t change our outlook on our business. We feel very good about our business, but it's early in the year and we know that those markets are going to be challenged and we're just baking in some caution around those markets. Mike Weinstein : Understood. So let me two quick follow-ups relative to the guidance. So one, you started to talk about the cost transformation initiative in greater detail in San Francisco and in the 2016 guidance, you're basically assuming no SG&A leverage and that's part of what you're what about reinvesting back in the business with the benefit of the MedTech packs, helping the gross margin line. So can you just talk a little about where you're going to incrementally invest if that will show up in SG&A or will it all show up in R&D. And then second, the acceleration of the share buyback and acceleration maybe is not the right term, but you bought that more stock than you had been buying back in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's in your 2016 guidance curve for capital deployment? Bill Jellison : Yeah, so it's couple different questions there. The first one associated with kind of the margin rates and also the SG&A area. We do and expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the reinvestment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area. I would say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen and obviously better leverage there, but with the reinvestment that will slow that down at least this year, but we should still be showing obviously some very solid gross margin rate improvement and we should be getting good drop-through still into the operating income line for that. As it relates to the buybacks, yes we did jump that up to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash. We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point and as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that we commented before that we've got the authorization out there. We expected to complete that over kind of a two to three year period of time barring any sizeable acquisitions and hopefully as Kevin mentioned, acquisitions are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space and we expect to be very active as we move forward, but those are all based on timing situations right. So -- but that is still our number one focus. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead. Rick Wise : Hi Kevin. Hi everybody. Maybe Kevin to start my first would be on the operating margin outlook. Obviously you're exiting 15% to 27.4% maybe just comment if you would on your aspirational goals here? Is it 30%? Is it 35% over the next two to four and three to five years, but just talk about the magnitude and the durability of this seemingly long-tailed opportunity? Kevin Lobo : So Rick, look we only give guidance out for one year right. So we provided you guidance this year, which shows some pretty meaningful leverage on the EPS line. Coming off the year, we just delivered leverage and we didn't have the 12% to 13% share of negative FX. We would be giving EPS in the 10% to 14% range. So that's pretty meaningful leverage on sales of 5% to 6%. So you should expect us to continue to drive meaningful leverage. That's the goal of the constant program. We've said before there are significant opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars and as we drive those savings, we'll obviously if there is great opportunities to invest, we'll invest some of those dollars and some of those dollars will fall to the bottom line. But I don't have a magical number and I think it also depends on as the year's progress, what types of deals that we do and how that affects our margin profile. So I think each year, you'll expect us to give the kind of guidance we're giving you this year, nice robust organic growth and a nice amount of leverage to the bottom line and I think I'll just leave it at that. Rick Wise : Okay. And Katherine maybe for you on MAKO. Can you give us a little more color on your comment you talked about increased demand for the hip indication. It seemed to me you've placed a few more systems than we expected. Can you talk about the placements and the utilization and maybe where you are in the rollout for new indications in software? Katherine Owen : So I think it really is reflective of being complete year two of the acquisition. So working through the integration and really helping the combined sales forces to optimize their education and around the features and benefits of our hip system on the robot-assisted platform and getting out there and really detailing those benefits. It's a nice mix of both existing striker customers, but also new accounts that we're able to get into with the robots. We're really pleased with the placement as well as having a number of them outside the U.S. I would really just emphasize 2016 is about really working to make sure we are optimally set up for full commercial launch in '17 for the total needs, so we are not expecting any real impact from that this year. We have a lot of work to do to optimize the training protocol. We're going to work with key opinion leaders, both on the robotic side as well as KOLs with our triathlon system to make sure we are meshing those observational studies to really fine-tune the training protocol. We then have to train our own sales force do the upgrades of the system. So there is a lot work to be done to make sure when we go into full commercial launch, we're set to really optimize that and have a presence at the podium. So we'll continue to drive placements with the existing indications for 2016 while doing the necessary ground work to really ensure when the great position in 2017 to take full advantage of the total knee indication. Operator : And our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to just start with some of the investment spending that you're committing to through the P&L. Over the past several years, you've been very consistent with investing your business both SG&A and R&D, which has obviously produced this very nice topline growth rate. But as you look forward as you continue to invest in the business, do you see opportunities to enhance the topline growth rate beyond what you're performing today and where are the most attractive areas of investment for you? Kevin Lobo : Well, I can tell you that I get a chance to travel around all of our divisions over the course of the year and yet to meet and R&D that has enough money to spend on new product. So I would say that all the divisions have opportunities. There is clearly some areas that we would focus on a little bit more than others. So you've seen our spine business really start to turn based on focused investments in R&D. We've had three great quarters in a row in the U.S. We still have to take a lot of those products outside the U.S. But I would say that will be in area where organic development and spending is really paying off for us. So you could expect more in that area. Sports medicine for us is a business that's growing very fast. It's relatively small within Stryker. That's also an area of interest. Neurotechnology as well as extremities, I would say I picked those four right off on top of my head, but I would tell you we have a long list and if my other division president's are listening on the call, I know that they're preparing ideas for me as well. And we'll obviously look at all the ideas and determine which ones we think can really provide value for us. We're not going to just spend for the sake of spending. In the company as big as Stryker is with the decentralized focus, we're seeing that innovation delivers. And I cited one example of 3D printing where I think we're seeing it to have an impact on two different divisions of striker our knee business as well as spine and we have a huge line up of other divisions with ideas and prototypes to get into 3D printer titanium product. So I would say that those are the top of mind areas of focus, but all the divisions are lining up and we'll be very selective as we march through that and we'll share more as the year unfolds. David Roman : Okay. That's very helpful. And then on the capital spending side, the $400 million to $450 million at the end of the high end of the range that would be almost a doubling from where you were I think in 2014. Could you maybe just help us go into a little bit detail on where those CapEx dollars are going? How much of that are 2016 isolated in nature and what the implications of this additional CapEx are to the rest of the business down the road? Kevin Lobo : Sure. I'd say that there is beyond just supporting the operations in the higher growth level that we've got in the company, there is a couple of areas of specific investment. One is on in the ERP transformational area, which is strengthening our global ERPs on a world-wide basis and reducing the numbers that we have. So we're on a more consistent common system there. The second one is actually we're building a brand new state-of-the-art 3D printing manufacturing facility this year as well too. So we're spending some dollars I think in some key potential growth areas for us and we might want to take advantage of that this year is a little bit of a blip in comparison to what that normal CapEx would be. Operator : And the next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Just a couple of question. One, Kevin, just to start off with the Ortho market, I wonder if you could just comment on 2015 if you think about the underlying momentum in the market and your share position, how much relative share you may or may not taken in '15 and how those dynamics in your mind compare to the outlook you'd see for '16 both in terms of how the [audio gap]? Kevin Lobo : \u2026the last three, four years have been in line with the market or maybe slightly below. And I think we're going to start to see a bit of over-performance there behind innovation and launching new products. So we feel good about our position in those two. Trauma, of course as you know has been standout for us about four years and we continue to launch new products and we continue to growth very well. So to us the market seems very stable. We like our position in each of the categories. If you conclude spine within your definition of orthopedics, I would say that was an area that had been more troubled for us, but we feel we're on a very good path now. So across the portfolio and I just had a chance to spend time at the sales meeting for orthopedics and spine, I could tell you they feel very good about our competitive position in a market that seems very stable. So I think we'll see more of the same in terms of volume growth and we like our competitive position. David Lewis : Okay. Thanks Kevin, and just two quick ones. One, just Katherine, just thinking about MAKO for a second, you're now selling more systems than the target MAKO ever did. And I wonder are you seeing any push back on ASP system around a million dollars. And in light of one of your competitors acquiring another competitor specifically in robotics, do you expect to see some ASP pressure in '16 or '17? And then Bill, you sparked my interest on the 3D printing facility. Is this is a facility that will be capable of doing 3D printed full total knee and hips or is this more derivative products to the orthopedic process? Thank you. Katherine Owen : On the capital side, obviously, that's always going to be a conversation. You don't sell a million dollar capital easily, but I will tell you we are million dollar capitals. So those robots are sold. They're not placed. I think what we're doing is really leveraging the ability to offer different models and we talked about our flex financial. So giving customers the ability to outright purchase or lease depending on their needs and I think that's how helping and it's really I think the difference between when MAKO with standalone is we have a very large selling organization that over the last two years has really come to understand the features and the benefits. And the value proposition has only improved going from the knees then to a hip, then to a hip with our hip system is on it and now knowing that total knee will be coming, I think helps in that sales process as well. But we are selling those robots and I don't anticipate that changing in 2016 related to any competition that might be out there. Bill Jellison : And the second part of your question was around 3D printing. So we've launched over the past few years we've started with part of our knee system to enable cementless knee. So tibia base plate. We have this past year in the middle of the year launched revision cones with geometry that can only be made with 3D printing. We have our patella that we've launched that's 3D printed and now we're just about to launch a 3D printed titanium interbody device for spine. So all of the products we've launched thus far that our 3D printer are all innovative new products. In the case of the spine product and the cementless product it allows for bony in-growth because they're porous materials and getting very good feedback from our customers. For the foreseeable future, at least the next three, four years or so, our focus is really on innovative new products and not replacing our existing products with 3D printed products. The pipeline of innovative new geometries that can't be made without 3D printing is the area of focus. So it's not about trying to replace our products and drive down cost. Over time ten years from now that could be the case, but in the near to midterm, it's really focused on innovative new products. Operator : And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristen Stewart : Hi, can you guys hear me okay. Kevin Lobo : Yes we can Christina. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. So Bill, I'll reiterate definitely congratulations on your retirement we definitely will miss you. So just a question more strategically, I was just wondering if you feel good about the three main buckets that you have now and whether or not Kevin you feel like there is any need to expand beyond that and get into any other white spaces at this point? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, no Kristen I'll be consistent with I will be saying in the past couple of years and our strategy is to stay within these three segments fee. We like our position in these three segments. We want to continue if you look at all of our acquisitions they've strengthened each of our businesses that we're currently in. And I think every year we do a white space assessment and the white space assessment is not as attractive as staying within our segments. There are a significant number of targets within our segment. I know we only completed two deals. There is a little bit quieter year in 2015, but I can tell you the activity level was no different in 2015 with a lot of deals being discussed and so I would expect us to continue along our current strategy and don\u2019t expect us to suddenly jump into a white space. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just with respect to the narrow tech area, are there any notable clinical activities coming up for trial readouts or can you speak to any new product pipelines or just think that we should be aware of that could help growth even though obviously it's been going really well. Kevin Lobo : No, we've been with this -- thanks Kristen. We love this business and I would say our coiling and the ischemic stroke were in great shape and we are growing very well in those two categories. The one area for Stryker that is slight gap is the flow diverting stent segment. We are selling that outside the U.S. but we don\u2019t yet have U.S. approval. We have in the process of just completing up a trial and we'll be submitting for that, but we're still -- we still have some time before that\u2019s get approved. That\u2019s the one area we\u2019re not in. So we're driving this terrific growth without being in that one segment in the United States. So that\u2019s an ongoing process. We'll update you more towards the end of this year in terms of when that will come to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Jason Wittes : Hi, thanks for taking the question. It sounds like we should view the total knee coming out next year as sort of a transformational product. If I look into this year can you may be highlight some of the products that we should be focused on that really drive that growth this year? Katherine Owen : I would really look at is across the Board very typical Stryker fashion where its more singles and doubles whether it's Endo launching their new 1588 camera or MAKO continuing to drive indications like Hip with the new BS Stryker brand that we talked about or Spine with their new products that are coming out 3D printed. So, it\u2019s really a story about those incremental innovative new products. Usually no one on its own is a growth driver. It's the totality of that offering that really allows us to sustain that organic growth at the high end of MedTech. Clearly next year we'll set up for some more impactful products that when you think about MAKO and the total Knee and expecting to be on a clear trajectory of taking meaningful market share as work our way through '17. Ischemic is one more of those more transformational opportunities. There is a lot of market development that still needs to take place there around the patient path referral systems, hospital -- inter hospital transfer. So we talked about that being a multiyear process, but clearly seeing some very good growth rates, but off of a still small base. But I would really think about this year is the typical Stryker story. We've got a lot of products, a lot of momentum, dedicated sales force with especially -- a specialty focus that\u2019s really helping to drive that 5% to 6% growth we're targeting. Jason Wittes : Okay. Very helpful and just a quick follow-up for MAKO can you give us a sense of how many of these new placements are to existing accounts and how many of these de novo? Just kind of\u2026 Katherine Owen : We haven\u2019t broken out -- out of the 31, we haven\u2019t broken out, I would tell you though that it is a combination of both existing Stryker customers as well as new customers where we haven\u2019t had any type of meaningful presence. So we haven\u2019t given it with more granularity than that but there is a nice mix. Jason Wittes : Great, thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Please go ahead. Kevin Lobo : Hello, Matt? Operator : Matt your line is open. Matt Miksic : Sorry about that guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Super job on the numbers it looks like and I'll pass along my congratulations and farewell to Bill. We will also miss you. So on MAKO, just a couple of maybe broader questions on how you're positioning the platform. Robotics has been kind of a market development project for a while. Oftentimes dealing with surgeons and helping them get more comfortable with new technology, maybe changing the way surgeries over the long term. But what point does this become or has it already become an opportunity to drive better contracting for you across your implant lines, greater share or utilization multi-line contracting driven by the merits of this system and the technology and I've a couple of quick follow-ups? Kevin Lobo : So Matt, I would say, look we're still in the early stages. Stryker hip brands are now available recently and we haven't launched a total knee yet. So I think those are the big applications and to say that it is impacting contracting yet, I would say it's too early for that. Once this becomes a more mature business, which will take a couple of years, then I think obviously having a system that if the surgeons are having a great experience and they enjoy it and they want to use the products, it really does provide us with great differentiation, which will -- and differentiation will show up in many different ways including potentially in contracting. But we're ways from that yet. We have a lot of work to do in the next couple of years to really gain more broad adoption of the technology. Matt Miksic : Another on the same topic here, Katherine someone asked earlier about hips and what's changing and how you're improving in performance there? To put that in perspective I remember when hips came out and when you first acquired the system, it wasn\u2019t generally thought to be really where the bank for the buck was with the robot. And I guess what's changing, is application getting a lot easier, is people getting -- are they proving out the benefits of the hip? What's driving uptake against what was historically viewed as sort of like not the greatest application for the robot? Kevin Lobo : Okay. So I'll take this question. So look when I tell you the first iterations of the hip software were a little bit clumpy and it requires quite a bit more registration time -- you have to register in the software system. So that's just an extra step that some of the surgeons were a little bit frustrated with. Over time both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user friendly. That's been one factor for sure. I think the most compelling factors is showing the surgeons on the pre-imposed X-rays that they put the hip exactly where they want to put it and I think even though surgeons that had some hesitations when they see pre-imposed X-rays, they're just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand -- before they weren\u2019t doing that. They weren\u2019t able to get that same type of consistency and that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons and now being able to put our implants in addition with easier to use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things that change right. Change doesn\u2019t occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early adopters. Some people frankly will never adopt. They\u2019ll just be set in their ways, but what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift it's mindset and frankly the more of it robotics has talked about in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening and thank you for taking the question. I have two questions. The first one has to do with 3D printing. It became quite aware that a couple of years ago, now you're definitely doing a bigger focus on that. What does it take for a 3D printed call it hip or knee to become more mainstream, is it manufacturing, is it clinical data? How should we think about this evolving? Kevin Lobo : Well it's a long answer Joanne and the reason I pause is to get into all the technology on 3D printing will take a long time. The quick summary is the 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic having it on a desk in an office and cranking out 3D printed products. So metal is much more complicated. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming. You just don't buy a machine and sort off to the race as it's a lot more complicated than that and so we spent a lot of time. We've been working on this for many, many years and so we have a lot of knowhow on how to program the machines and optimize the machines and so there is a lot of factors that go into it to be able to create and different types of machines work that are for smaller products than larger products. So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I would just say that its more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press and that\u2019s why for us, our focus is much more on innovative new products and not necessarily replacing total systems that will be many, many, many years ahead of us. Joanne Wuensch : That\u2019s very helpful. As a follow up, what should we expect at the upcoming AAOS? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yes Joanne, I think it will be typical to prior years, clearly there is going to be a big focus around MAKO, as we think about Uni as well as Hip, it\u2019s too early in our initial commercial launch activities to have a big focus on user feedback from total knees although I sure that we have lot of surgeon presence around that as they\u2019re looking to get educated on the features and benefits. And we\u2019ll have a tour of the booth as we\u2019ve done previously to highlight new products across all the business from Trauma, Foot and Ankle, Spine etcetera and we'll also have an opportunity while we're there just to sit down and meet with management and have a open Q&A forum. Operator : And the next question comes from the Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good afternoon. Wonder if I could ask a question about the CJR, CCJR program that\u2019s rolling out. I know that you guys have been pretty clear as all the companies have that you don\u2019t think it's going to have much impact on pricing and focus on post acute care, which pretty much mirrors the hearing as well. But my question is really around how Stryker interfaces with that model? When you perform at solutions business, you guys were involved in some of the bundle payments initiatives before. Is there an opportunity for you guys to perhaps benefit from the CGR program as it rolls out? Katherine Owen : Yeah, we agree with your comments. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact. We have seen in past with some of our prior program that really does drive to focus on post acute and patients that are discharged right to rehab given the high cost there. We do have a small business our Stryker Performance Solutions that we think can help work with hospitals to help to make them aware of the data. So they can have a sense of what best-in-classes and where some of the cost benefits they can realize whether it\u2019s around infection rates, transfusion etcetera. So it's not a huge part of our business, but it is one that provides insights and does help them as they think about their overall cost structure. But clearly we continue to believe based on everything we\u2019ve seen that it's going to be a post acute care. We haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change at all in price between those trial areas as it relates to implant pricing and really the cost that savings they can realize focusing on rehab really do dwarf anything else at this point in time. Raj Denhoy : Right. May be just as a follow-up, but if you think about that service offering if that\u2019s the way to describe it, which Performance Solutions certainly does some of, if we should think about the next several years do you envision that service components becoming a bigger part of the business, offering not just implants to hospitals but perhaps something a bit broader? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, that division is continuing to focus on that. It\u2019s not a huge part of our company. I think we see this CCJR is a terrific example and opportunity for us to grow that business but it's not at a scale of which I really want to start highlighting it. I would tell you a year from now I think we'll have a much better idea of the scope of CCJR and whether that can become a broader business for us. So services is not something new to Stryker. Well lot of our MedSurg business provides services to hospitals. We have people in the hospitals that our customer pay for to make sure that all their up time is working on their equipment. So we're not against services at all, but we don\u2019t sort of like to get out in front of ourselves. Let\u2019s see how this year unfolds and if the business becomes something that could be scalable, then we'll talk about a lot more, but right now it\u2019s a small part. I agree with you that CCJR does provide an exciting opportunity for that business, but it\u2019s a very small part of Stryker. Operator : And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with M&A, about a year ago Kevin you said you expected to put the balance sheet to work and I just wanted to confirm if that's still the case and I am asking because obviously you've been relatively quiet on the acquisition front over the past 6 to 12 months which is atypical. So is there any reason you haven't pulled the trigger on more deals and I had one follow-up. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Sure, I would tell you just deal timing is inherently unpredictable. There is absolutely no change in the statement I made before I still intend to put the balance sheet to work. The reason we got the extra share buyback approval level was just in case deals don\u2019t get over the line or drag on, for extended periods of time we would start to step up the buybacks, but you should expect us to continue to be very active acquirer, but you\u2019ve seen in the past right sometimes, some years there is one or two deals another years you see many more deals. So, our level of activity hasn\u2019t changed. I still see many exciting prospects out there and so we\u2019re staying the course with the existing strategy. Larry Biegelsen : And then earlier you said that in Q1, you would expect to be at the low end of the 5% to 6% I think constant currency growth rate because of what you\u2019re seeing in emerging markets. And so -- but you expect emerging markets to be relatively weak throughout 2016 I believe. So my question is does getting the growth rate up above that the low range in the range does that depend upon an improvement in the emerging market and if not, how do you get that growth rate up? Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine Owen : Yeah, I would just comment that if you look at the cadence of quarters, last year we had some difficult comparisons in the first quarter as related to emerging markets more of the pressure particularly in China unfolded as the year went on. We're going to have easier comps in the back half of the year. We tend to have a seasonally stronger second half of the year particular as it relates to the fourth quarter. So it's more just reflective of how our quarters tend to play out in some of the year-over-year comparisons. Operator : And our next question comes from the Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Glenn Novarro : Hi, thanks. Kevin your U.S. Hip and Knee business had a strong fourth quarter of 6% and 9% respectively. Did you see in the fourth quarter the U.S. Orthopedic market accelerate or pickup a bit or do you think that was more share capture from Zimmer given the integration between Zimmer and Biomet and then I had a follow up question on robotics? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so look until we see everybody report, it's really difficult for me to say how much of it is the market versus comparative share capture. The Knee number, we're encouraged about. We tend to believe our Knee improvement is more driven by the new products, the revision cones and more of uptick of our cementless Knee offering. So we believe that\u2019s more of the issue than let's call it sales force disruptions or any other factors that are occurring at other companies. It's more about our innovation. When I talk to our field, the sense on getting is a very stable market. So wasn\u2019t -- a few years ago, we saw this big seasonal fourth quarter lift. We'll now we're seeing a typical fourth quarter. This December was more or less typical. Its more active, but was more active a year ago two. So we\u2019re not seeing -- we didn\u2019t see anything or major in terms, from quarter-to-quarter you do sometimes see slight upticks or downticks, but until the report it's going to be difficult for me to comment, but I think you had a second question. Glenn Novarro : Yes, Katherine in your prepared remarks you talked about with the MAKO system podium presentations in 2016. So, can you describe what type of presentations -- I\u2019m assuming these are clinical trials, so what type of trials and when can we see these trials being presented? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yeah, my comments were that we\u2019re going to do observational studies in 2016. So really looking at key opinion leaders who have extensive experience with robotics to understand how we can fine-tune the training protocol and optimize the rollout. We\u2019re also going to be doing observational studies with key opinion leaders who have a lot of familiarity with the triathlon system. So we can mesh those two datasets and really put us in a position to have a presence at the podiums in 2017 not '16. So we think mining the full commercial launch and being in a position in 2017 for those initial users those key opinion leaders to talk about their experience and how they were able to optimize both the robot as well as our triathlon will help drive the adoption. We\u2019re going to continue to collect additional clinical data, but that is going to take our number of years. This is really focused around observational studies to help optimize the training protocol. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Mike Matson : Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to start with the new camera at the endoscopy business, how does this compare with the prior model? Is it more of an incremental improvement? And just in terms of the impact on the growth rate there, do you expect that to me more of a step change or more of a ramp in terms of the growth and endoscopy and then I have one follow-up? Kevin Lobo : So no, just the 1588, so each term we have a new version and we call it the classrooms 1488 as you know, now we're calling it 1588. Aim is the name of it. I would say it's meaningfully better certainly 1488 had terrific resolution, but we've improved the backlighting and some of the image clarity for certain procedures like E&T. So our products works well in wide variety of procedures, but there are certain procedures where highlighting just wasn\u2019t quite as optimized and we made some nice enhancements there. So across the range of procedures surgeons are all going to have a delightful experience whereas in the past it was not necessarily across every specialty that\u2019s the first thing. Second thing is we have ICG built into our light source, which we never had before. So with a press of a button, you can light up the organs just I am sure you're familiar with ICG with the comparative product out there. But this is not -- doesn\u2019t require extra piece of capital. It's built right into the existing light source, easy for the surgeons to use, which is wonderful. It also includes another product for GYN that lights up parts of the anatomy. So it's really a safe surgery launch. And it enables safe surgery with enhanced visualization and we just launched it in December. So, we don\u2019t a huge amount of sales yet, but I would say the earlier clinical feedback has been very positive. So I do expect endoscopy to have a better year in 2016 than they did in 2015. Mike Matson : Okay. Thanks and then just with regard to this big ERP project that you have, what\u2019s the execution risk there that something gets, some balls get dropped in terms of the inventory levels and things like that causing impact on your overall results for the company? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so like with any system of implementation there is always some degree of risk. We\u2019re being very thoughtful and careful about how we go about the project. We're staffing -- we're putting our best people on it. They're in dedicated -- in a dedicated workspace. And in fact my former Head of HR who also has run businesses is going to be leading the business component of that and I've appointed a new Head of HR that send a terrific signal through the organization of kind commit more making. It will be measured launch. So it will take a number of years before complete and we\u2019re starting off with our instruments division and we\u2019re going to continue to -- we have a steady study march plan that we have an IT leader who is partnering with the business leader who has -- was -- had a previous MedTech company doing exactly this kind of an implantation over the past few years. So, we believe it's all of our talent staffing the right people who know our business and we\u2019re going to do our best obviously to mitigate the risk. We had a painful experience in Japan a couple of years ago. I can tell you the approach of this project is radically different to the approach we used in that project. And so we feel we'll be in good shape and it's not a big bang launch. We\u2019re going to do division by division, region by region and there will be a steady cadence. So even if something does start to wobble a little bit, it should have very, very little impact. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay. Katherine Owen : Yep, we can hear you. Matt Taylor : Great. So I was just wondering if you could just follow up on some of those comments on 3D printing and you talked about the materiality of the contributions in the quarter and what you're expecting out that you\u2019re going to be investing more in this new plan? How big is it and how material could that be. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so for the moment these are innovative products that are adding I'll call it incremental growth. It's not the core growth. The core growth is our big systems right our triathlon or accolade. That\u2019s where the core amount of our sales comes from. But this gives a little extra boost and puts a little bit of jump in our sales force step. Gives them something new to talk to the customer about. So, as an example of our vision business lagged -- our market share lagged our primary business in needs by about five or six market share points. So we've been in our Stryker friendly account. Sometimes they would go to a competitive -- a competitor to do the revision procedure. Now that we have it, we consider best-in-class revision cones, not only do we keep that business at certain stages with Stryker, we gain that sales, but they're not something that they can go talk to a competitive surgeon about. So I would say it's not a huge contributor, but it\u2019s an extra shot in the arm. So with Robotics and 3D printing, we believe we have the lead on both of those areas and those are things we can talk about that differentiate us from our competition. So again not -- even today Robotics is not a huge component of our growth or our actual dollar sales, but we believe they are the ones that are causing that extra piece of growth and in a different view of Stryker for the future. Over time, I expect Robotics and 3D print to take on a more important portion of our overall sales and there will be sustainable and sticky if we have something that the competition doesn\u2019t have. Matt Taylor : Okay. Great and just one question on the Transatlantic Model, it seems like you\u2019re making some progress there. Can you talk about where you are and how much that's helped to improve some of the OUS results and where you think that could go? Kevin Lobo : Yes so look, Europe has exceeded my expectations. We had -- really our international growth doesn\u2019t look fantastic. So you don\u2019t see it, but Europe had a mid-single digit growth year and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. So, that kind of uptick is frankly ahead of where I expected it to be. It\u2019s been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China. So that has dampened our international sales, but it\u2019s been a really great success. I\u2019m excited about what I\u2019m seeing across our businesses in Europe. Some of the divisions took off faster than others like trauma, extremities and endoscopy took off really quickly and now I am starting to see some nice uptick in instruments in spine towards the end of the year. So more to come in Europe. We made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold and I think you will start to see Europe become a division that delivers better topline and starts to deliver some leverage going forward. We\u2019ve added Canada. So those are now directly managed, a division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions we haven\u2019t yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, we now have them reporting directly to our Business Group President. So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President. Over time, we\u2019ll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don\u2019t want to run too fast to fully integrate a complete global business units especially with markets like China that are so different or Japan. But we\u2019re very pleased with the progress so far, taking out that position puts nothing about cost reduction that was 100% just to increase speed and connectivity of those countries to our business. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Keeler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matt Keeler : Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones first on Hips outside the U.S. you highlighted the drag from emerging markets, but your Knee growth actually picked up pretty nicely. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was a much more pronounced impact from that emerging market to drag on Hips relative to Knees and if there were any other factors that impacted your Hip business outside the U.S.? Kevin Lobo : No, nothing particular. You see this from quarter-to-quarter and sometimes you will see sort of Hips jump in the case of Hips, Canada is an example there was a Hip tender that we lost. So that accounted for some of the Hip growth. There is not one overwriting factor. It\u2019s sort of a story by story, country by country and we see this from quarter-to-quarter. Sometimes you'll see Knee -- our business is not as big outside the U.S. So you do see a little bit more volatility in our numbers whether its Hips, Knees, Spine. Once those businesses get larger you should expect that there will be less volatility. Matt Keeler : Great. Thanks and just lastly instruments growth was pretty strong in the quarter, but I think you highlighted that business is later on in its product cycle. So just wondering if you think the level of growth we saw in the fourth quarter if that's sustainable going forward and what are some of the products to watch where you are maybe little later on in that product cycle? Kevin Lobo : Yes so the Power Tools is the product that we refer to as being late in the cycle. The system setting power tools, which is probably the biggest single product category within instruments but instruments has a lot of other products. So they have Neptune. They're launching a new signature line of drills. We actually report that as part of a neurotech, but it\u2019s run by our instruments division, but yes they have the sponge counter as well patient safety company that we acquired. So these are different kinds of businesses that can drive growth. It\u2019s a little less predictable in Power Tools. So I think we're very excited by how they finished the year. They finished the year very, very strong and we think they will have a good year, but longer in the cycle sometimes we do see them tailing off a little bit. So I would expect the year that's similar to the year that they had this year overall. Operator : And our next question comes from Rich Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Rich Newitter : Hi thanks for squeezing me in. Kevin, I was hoping just to get some comments on spine. You characterized the market as stable and you\u2019re clearly seeing some nice uptick in the growth rates there yes into product launches. So my question really is has there been any change or can you give us your updated thoughts on how you view external versus internal investments in this division for you, now that things seem to be on better footing? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so I\u2019m really excited about what we're doing organically. So we\u2019ve re-tooled our R&D organization, some of our marketing organization over the past few years and this business is hitting its stride and we're launching more and more new products. We\u2019re getting into MIS which was an area that we were softer in before, if you look back three, four years ago. And so it's great to see the organic growth. Organic growth obviously is much more financially attractive than going out and spending a lot of money on companies. Over time I do want this to become a bigger division and I think it's likely to see a combination of both organic and acquisitions, but it's always better to have a strong organic business. And so I do not feel at all that I need to do an acquisition because of the strength in what we've started to build internally, but that's something that will likely happen over time. Rich Newitter : Okay. Thanks, and then just on extremity again your Foot and Ankle growth, I think you said it was 20% that this business continues to truck along. Any comments on the end markets versus potential share gains that we might have seen in the quarter and specially are you seeing any disruptions from recent M&A in the field? Thanks. Katherine Owen : Yeah, I would just say these are markets that continue to be very healthy growing double digits. We do believe we\u2019re taking market share. We\u2019ve got a dedicated sales focus there, some great products. I wouldn\u2019t call it any disruptions that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. I think it\u2019s just continues to be really good execution in a market that has favorable underlying growth dynamics. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Joshua Jennings : Hi, good evening. Thank you. Kevin I just wanted -- hoping you touch on pricing. I think recently you had some public commentary about some potential moderation in the pricing headwinds that you've historically been experiencing. Any comments in terms of assumptions for pricing headwinds within guidance and any outlook for pricing particularly in Orthopaedics. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so you saw for the full year our price did moderate somewhat from the prior year and there was a lot of concern as we exit, if you remember as we\u2019re exiting '14 there was a lot of concern that the pricing was going to accelerate in '15. In fact it hasn\u2019t it actually moderated a little bit, but it\u2019s modest, right, the moderation is very modest and in our guidance we suggest that the price will be between 1.5% to 2%. And so I would say it's a stable market. We\u2019ve continued to have price pressure. It's not going away, but we don\u2019t see any accelerators to that price pressure and that\u2019s why we feel it's going to be pretty stable going into 2016. Joshua Jennings : Great, and just one follow up on MAKO, we haven\u2019t heard much over the last year on the Uni Knee product. Any commentary there in terms of how its contributing to growth in your Knee franchises and just overall growth for that product line. Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Thanks. Obviously the Unit market when its put in the context of overall Stryker its very small part of the overall business and I would say it's just -- it\u2019s a steady contributor but there is nothing remarkable to say about it. It\u2019s a good business, but it\u2019s a very small part of our overall need. Katherine Owen : Are you just talking Josh specifically for MAKO. Kevin Lobo : No, he got\u2026 Katherine Owen : So for MAKO it\u2019s the first indication. They\u2019re continuing to drive uptake for that as well as with Hip and as we get additional indication, I think it helped us. It does help drive adoption as some customers were not interested in just the Uni, but as we get more indications, they\u2019re starting to adapt for that as well as the others. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, but I\u2019m just trying to interrupt sorry that Josh got cut off just to interrupt that the growth to 9% in the U.S. that\u2019s spike in growth. It really wasn\u2019t driven by MAKO or Uni. That\u2019s driven more by the broader Knee business. Operator : And next question comes from the Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. Just quickly on MAKO again, the number of systems you placed internationally accelerated here in Q4. Was there anything that you can call out as far as maybe a little bit of tipping point in terms of interest in the robotic system, OUS and maybe that could be an even more meaningful contributor here in 2016? Katherine Owen : No, still the lion's share of the focus and the revenue was coming from the U.S. and get place more systems outside the U.S. and we'll continue to focus on those opportunities particularly places like Australia and certain other markets, but the bulk of the revenue stream has been and will likely continue at least near term to be U.S. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, it tends to be a country by country thing. So Australia had a terrific year in robot sales. I think within Europe we\u2019re going to see certain countries are going to adopt MAKO much more quickly than other countries. So I think each year you'll see the international volume starting to increase, but it might be Italy this year. It might be the U.K. next year, over the next few years, but again to Katherine\u2019s point the market that\u2019s the most important by far is going to the U.S. market. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. And then just to follow-up a little bit on Richard\u2019s question, a little more broadly on trauma and extremities, I think we saw some acceleration here in Q4 beyond what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. And I\u2019m just curious if that acceleration was specific to any couple of products or geographies around particularly the U.S. and if that level of growth is something that you think is sustainable here in 2016? Kevin Lobo : Well I think you\u2019ve seen our trauma business in the U.S. it's been four years of really terrific growth. So that to me is sustainable when you\u2019re growing at that level. So we\u2019re very pleased. We\u2019ve rounded our portfolio completely and so that enables us to do complete hospital conversions something that was impossible with Stryker five, six years ago. Europe really picked up quickly. So as we move to the Transatlantic Model, I was very encouraged by our trauma success in Europe. We have not been nearly as successful in Europe as we have been in the United States and we do now have the same products, which are all approved. So I think -- I expect more commercial success in Europe as well as Japan. Now some of those products take a little longer to get approved in Japan. So I think that once those products start to arrive, we will start to see more of an uptick in Japan as well. But I would say we are in very good position in that business. We have a very, very strong leadership team and we expect to continue to have success in trauma extremities. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon and Bill just once best wishes I was looking back this afternoon I think it has been 14 years that you and I have overlapped. So thanks for all the conversation, all the help over that time. And so Kevin just wanted to ask just question, one follow-up question here just on the phasing or maybe gaiting of some of the MedTech tax savings. Is there going to be any timing differential between when the MedTech tax savings start coming and influencing the cost of goods line versus when you start reinvesting those dollars back into SG&A and R&D. Should those match pretty evenly out of P&L or just how to think about the gaiting throughout this year? Kevin Lobo : I think that that\u2019s fair to say Jeff and thanks a lot for your comments. I think that on the cost of goods sold category obviously that will start to write off in the beginning of the year. Our investments as we are targeting right now moving again through 2016, we would also expect to be doing that in reinvestment pretty much consistently throughout the year. Jeff Johnson : All right. That's all I have. Kevin Lobo : Sorry, it\u2019s going to be clean from the beginning of the year, from the beginning of this year to 2017. It starts immediately. There is no lag effect which I think had happened prior with the different companies. So for us it's clean. You will see it cleanly in the two years. Jeff Johnson : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : Thanks guys. I actually just have one follow-up on ERP, you talked about the investment on the capital side. Are there any P&L impacts that we should expect over the next couple of years as you start to implement ERP and when do you anticipate the system being fully in place? Kevin Lobo : So a couple of different questions again there. So on the ERP side of the equation, from an investment perspective we won\u2019t see the first implementations really for about another year and half or so and then those will be rolled out over the next few years after that. As far as the cost side of equation goes, we would not expect that to be a big blip once we get to kind of the stabilized level that we've got in 2016 here, but moving forward and in fact if anything as those systems are implemented we would expect some of the benefits plus with the CTG initiatives that we've got kicked off, those will continue to roll in at different points throughout different years. We do have multi hundreds of millions of dollars targeted for that. Keep in mind as well that we have price downs in the $150 million to $200 million range that we need to be working to offset and then as far as the impacts associated with the investment, again that should be pretty consistent as we're moving forward beyond 2016. Bill Jellison : Yes just to add to that, I would say we do have some expense that will be hitting our P&L, but we\u2019re absorbing that within the guidance that we have provided to you. Steve Lichtman : Got it, thanks. That\u2019s all I had, thanks guys. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Kaila Krum from William Blair. Please go ahead. Kaila Krum : Hi guys. Just a couple of quick ones for me. The first clearly you all are still emphasizing M&A as a key priority herein. I am just curious if you can touch on how or if those conversations have changed tone, just with some evaluation pull back specifically that we've seen in recent weeks? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I would say that that shorter time period doesn\u2019t have an impact and as Kevin articulated we continue to be focused on M&A externally. There is going to be periods where it looks or less active depending on timing. Internally the teams have never been busier and there is no change in the strategy and the recent market disruption is what it is. Kaila Krum : Okay. And then I guess just to follow-up on an earlier question just around whether or not there is this potential for longer term growth rate to accelerate and then just pairing that with your earlier comments about MAKO and likelihood that 2016 is more of a setup year for 2017, is it fair to assume that overall topline growth could modestly accelerate heading into 2017 from 2015 levels? Katherine Owen : It's always our goal to grow sales at the high end of MedTech and certainly we've got some nice opportunities between ischemic and MAKO, and that's going to be in early stages next year. So probably premature to start to push towards higher growth rates in this year, but we feel really good with what we've set up for this year and hopefully can build on that in '17. Kevin Lobo : Yeah and I think we're going to learn a lot. So I think towards the end of this year, we'll be able to share more of the two additional platforms, both MAKO and ischemic drove closer to one, but I think can provide let's call them change of factories and growth for the company. Now whatever happens in '17, or '18, or '19 is there are new platforms. So it's not easy to predict, but I think we'll learn a lot over the course of this year and certainly be able to share more with you when we provide our guidance in the following year. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2016 results will be held on April 20. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Baird & Company Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Liz and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, who assumed the role of CFO effective April 1, and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by an M&A update from Katherine. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. We're pleased with our start to the year, as Q1 organic sales growth of 6.1% came in above our expectations, with strong performances across all three segments : Orthopedics, MedSurg and neurotechnology and spine. The performance was led by continued new product introductions and strong sales and marketing execution.  Geographically, Q1 was powered by ongoing momentum in the U.S., with sales growth of 8.9%. As expected, growth was challenged outside the U.S., given the tough year-over-year comparisons in emerging markets, where growth started to slow in the second quarter of last year. Challenges still exist in emerging markets, although the year-over-year impact should ease in the back half of the year. We continue to have good performance in Europe, Japan and Australia. Our strategy of business unit specialization with dedicated sales forces, marketing and R&D continue to be a differentiating factor in the sustainability of our above-market growth. Consistent R&D investment has generated strong internal product pipelines across the Company and we continue to augment them with acquisitions. We're thrilled to welcome Sage, Physio-Control and Synergistics to Stryker and believe that the addition of these companies will further strengthen our businesses. Looking at the P&L, we're building on 2015's success and delivered solid adjusted earnings growth of 11.7%, despite modest foreign currency headwinds. This improvement stemmed from the strong top-line and year-over-year gross margin expansion. Importantly, we continue to invest heavily in R&D in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales. Our cost transformation for growth efforts are in the early stages and are multiyear nature and we're starting to realize benefits. Overall, we're confident in our stated goal of achieving sales at the high end of medtech, with ongoing earnings leverage and believe our Q1 results position us well for 2016. I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on MAKO along with the two larger M&A deals we recently closed on, Sage and Physio-Control. With respect to MAKO, we sold seven robots during the quarter globally which is in line with the same period a year ago. As many of you know, capital sales tend to be the strongest in the fourth quarter and also can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We're highly encouraged by order trends which reinforces the growing interest and demand for the MAKO robotic system, fueled by the expanded indications and planned launch of the Total Knee system, where we continue to target full commercial rollout in 2017. There is no change to our launch plans for the Total Knee which will focus throughout 2016 on working with key opinion leaders to optimize the training protocol and gather observational data that will help to frame the anticipated benefits, all of which will ensure a strong podium presence at key orthopedic meetings as we move throughout 2017. In Q1, we're also encouraged by the robust procedure growth in both partial knees and hips using MAKO.  Turning to the recent M&A activity, in early April, we closed on both Sage and Physio-Control which will be integrated into our medical division. Starting with Sage, our focus will be to ensure the continuation of strong double-digit top-line growth that the Company has had a long history of achieving. With their market-leading product portfolio, focus on clinically supported innovation, product ease-of-use and strong sales support, we believe Sage can continue to drive both market expansion and share gain in the prevention of hospital-acquired conditions. Given our existing global footprint which includes strong and broad sales and marketing support, we believe that over time, Stryker can help drive adoption of the Sage portfolio outside the U.S., where revenue to date is limited as the Company had historically focused its investment in the U.S. market. Regarding Physio-Control, we believe we have significant opportunities over time to drive both sales and earning synergies, given our combined presence in the pre-hospital setting. In the near term, both businesses will operate largely independently, with a focus on their respective 2016 target and planned key new product launches. Importantly for both Sage and Physio-Control, we have identified and put in place a highly experienced integration team which, given our BD history, should help ensure a smooth integration. As we move through the first 12 months post closing of both Sage and Physio-Control, we will provide you with the pro forma quarterly growth rates for each to help provide visibility regarding our execution and their top-line contribution. There is no change to our previously announced expected accretion from both these transactions to adjusted EPS in 2016 and 2017 of $0.07 and $0.15 to $0.18, respectively. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Katherine. My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our overall performance, our constant currency organic sales growth of 6.1% exceeded the high end of our full-year expectations and came in better than our expectations at the start of the quarter. The growth, based on the same number of selling days, reflected strong U.S. volume and mix of 10.2%, marginally offset by pricing which was slightly negative, at 1.3%. Adjusted EPS of $1.24 increased 11.7% from 2015, primarily driven by our strong top-line growth and favorable margin performance. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.02 per share, roughly in line with our guidance. Looking at our segment highlights orthopedics' constant currency growth was 4.6% which was led by U.S. orthopedics growth of 7.9%, reflecting continued strong sales in our trauma and extremity business which grew 11% and a 9% increase in knees, reflecting continued momentum from our last quarter and the success of our Triathlon products, driven by our Tritanium revision cones, our cementless knee products, as well as new customer adoption of our MAKO [indiscernible] platform. We're now seeing an acceleration in our revision implant sales, where previously our market share lagged our overall total knee share. Partly offsetting the strong U.S. orthopedic performance was the continued challenging markets in China and Brazil which contributed to the negative 1.4% constant currency decline in international. Overall, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our orthopedics portfolio. Our MedSurg segment, with constant currency growth of 4.6%, also demonstrated strong momentum, with U.S. growth of 7.6%. Instruments had solid U.S. growth of 10.2%, with good performance in their waste management products. Endoscopy's new 1588 camera which features enhanced visualization that broadens the applicable surgical applications, was a primary driver for the division's solid performance and will continue to be a growth engine in 2016. Lastly, medicals growth which was up against a tough year-over-year comparable, benefited from strong demand for its market-leading stretcher and ambulance cot products which underscored the strength of its portfolio and the overall health and stability of hospital capital budgets that we're seeing in the market. As with orthopedics, MedSurg also experienced challenges in emerging markets, primarily China. We expect this to continue as we work through our distributors to drive demand and reduce the buildup of their inventories, recognizing comparisons will also ease as we move through 2016. All in all, our MedSurg businesses saw healthy order growth in the first quarter and should be well positioned to continue their momentum. Turning to neurotechnology and spine, the impressive year-end momentum achieved by this group continued in the first quarter, with 13.1% constant currency growth. Neurotechnology's 21% growth was highlighted by the developing market for device-based treatment of ischemic stroke. While there's still considerable market development required, we're highly encouraged by the potential for this segment and our Trevo stent retriever technology. As one of two major stent retrievers on the market, combined with compelling clinical data underscoring the efficacy of these devices, such as the MR CLEAN study, Stryker is well positioned for growth in neurovascular. We also continue to see excellent performance in our neuro-powered instruments business, led by strong growth in their signature drill products released last year. We also are encouraged by the solid showing up for spine, up 5.8% in the U.S. as new product launches, including a limiting launch of our 3D-printed interbody device, are clearly having an impact. Neurotechnology and spine continue to benefit from a new product pipeline resulting from robust R&D investment over the past few years. I will now focus on our first quarter operating highlights, starting with gross margin which on an adjusted basis increased 240 basis points to 68%. Of this improvement, roughly a quarter relates to the two-year suspension of the medical device tax, while the remainder reflects a favorable mix and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by negative pricing. As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D at 6.4% of sales which is in line with our overall target spend. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased to 37.4% of sales versus 35.9% in the prior period which was driven by increased selling activity, anticipated spending related to our new ERP deployment efforts and reinvestment of the medical device tax. Looking ahead, we expect SG&A on a full-year basis to be comparable to 2015. Overall, our operating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid top-line growth and favorable mix and gross margins, offset slightly by higher SG&A for the quarter. Lastly, some financial highlights on the other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings during the quarter, primarily to fund our recently completed Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Net interest expense will continue to be higher than Q1, as our borrowing incurred at the end of Q1. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure and the permanent renewal of certain tax extenders which was included in our guidance. Moving onto the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, with $7.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 17.2% was held in the U.S. This balance reflects $3.5 billion of proceeds related to our previously mentioned debt offering which is included in the $7.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $4.1 billion of cash was used to fund the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Turning to cash flow, our cash flow from operations for 2015 was $2 billion compared to $4 billion last year, as we made $0.1 billion of payments associated with our rejuvenated and AVG II recall. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from O-U.S. cash. Finally, as we have previously announced, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. With that, I will move on to our guidance. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect our full-year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions in the range of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in 2015. Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.65 to $5.80 for the full year and $1.33 to $1.38 for the second quarter. Now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis : So a couple of questions, Kevin just first off, just talk about the guidance. Obviously, the quarter was strong and it's a little early in the year, obviously, to raising your organic sales estimate, so obviously you have some conviction in the back half. As I think about the back half of the year, obviously medical comparables are going to get a little easier, emerging markets pressure should also ease. Is there anything else that you see in the business broadly across Stryker that is giving you the confidence in the raise to the organic sales guidance heading into the back half of the year? Kevin Lobo : I would say that I feel very good about the strength of our entire business portfolio. So if you look at MedSurg, you look at neurotechnology and even orthopedics, I really feel like we have balanced strength across our portfolio and that balanced strength is what gives us the confidence, even after the first quarter, to raise our organic sales guidance. So we had indicated previously that the first quarter would likely be closer to the 5% range and we exceeded that. And obviously, the emerging market comps will also ease as we get into the back half. So we're feeling very good about our position as we exit the first quarter and obviously feel confident about raising our organic sales guidance. David Lewis : Okay. Maybe just two quick follow-ups, maybe, for Katherine, one, I know obviously the neuro number was very strong in the quarter. There's a lot of focus on stent retriever, but can you just give us a sense, Katherine, where you stand on pipeline opportunities within neuro, specifically interventional neuro? And secondarily, is there any reason to believe MAKO capital sales get harder into the full knee launch that could be sort of a delayed effect until people see the full evidence and software in the back half of the year? Or based on order patterns, you remain pretty comfortable? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yes. So within neuro tech, the bulk of the revenue is still from the hemorrhagic side and we continue to launch next generation of the coils, different sizes, different shapes and continue to launch into additional geographies. And we're the market leader in that segment of the market. We do have a flow diverter on the market outside the U.S. It's in clinical in the U.S. We're probably still a year or two before U.S. market launch of that product, but that will clearly be an important product launch, given that they have captured a portion of the coil market where they are applicable. And then continuing to invest in ischemic stroke, although candidly a lot of what's going to have to happen over the next few years in the ischemic segment has more to do with market development, as Glenn mentioned in his comments. On MAKO, nothing that I would bring up to suggest that placements will get harder and if anything, the economic and value proposition associated with the robot as we move toward full commercial launch of the Total Knee indication only gets greater. So we expect to see continued strong demand. As we've talked about, this year is really focused on training. So that's going to be to ensure an optimal rollout and to make sure the initial user experience is as positive as it can be, but we would assume continued momentum. And as I mentioned, we're really pleased with incoming order trends. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Mike Weinstein : A couple quick questions, there were two things that probably surprised us in the quarter. One would have obviously been the gross margin which was well above expectations and recent trends. And I was hoping you could spend a minute on why that was. And then second is just the sustainability of the growth we're seeing in the neurovascular business. We showed no signs of slowing at the U.S. international this quarter. And rather than same development trends from 2015 on the back of the data and the guideline changes, anything else you could add would be helpful. Kevin Lobo : Sure. Mike, I will start off with the neurovascular and then I will turn it over to Glenn for the gross margin. So certainly, the ischemic market, it's a new market and there obviously are many strokes that hadn't been treated prior. I kind of think this a little bit like the foot and ankle market, you are creating a new market. And when you create a new market, it's difficult to predict the pace of growth, but there's no doubt that the growth will be very significant and that was clearly the biggest contributor to the strong performance in neurovascular but equally pleased with the performance of our neuro-powered instruments which are having fantastic growth. Very strong double-digit growth with our signature drills which compete with one of the other major players. And we're taking significant market share with those products as well as our Sonopet product. So very strong performance, both in neurovascular as well as the neuro-powered instruments and even our craniomaxillofacial business, the third of our neuro businesses, is enjoying double-digit growth. So across the neuro portfolio, we're really performing very well. I will turn it to Glenn for gross margin. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I think if you look at our gross margin, we really benefited from a positive mix relative to U.S. and international. And then even relative to newer products over some of our older products, if you look at the 1588 and the signature drills that were sold, those sell at largely premiums. And then finally, we also continue to see sort of our stalwart product, knees, trauma, our ischemic stroke and coil products continue to sell fairly robustly, too which help lift the overall margin up. Kevin Lobo : And price was also more moderate than we've seen in the past. Mike Weinstein : Right. Glenn, it also looked like your inventories were up a lot this quarter from the end of the year. Any expectation on those trending down? So what I'm asking is any of the uptick in gross margin here one time or do you want us to view it as sustainable? Glenn Boehnlein : No, I think the inventories up were just -- it's reflecting what we're planning for the rest of the year in making sure that we're able to satisfy customers. And as far as the gross margin goes, we expect that we will continue to see this kind of trend throughout the year. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed. Bob Hopkins : So the first question I wanted to ask is on the business outside the United States. Specifically, could you comment a little bit on the performance of your knee business outside the United States which was the one slightly weak spot within the ortho business? And then also, Kevin, I was wondering if you could just comment on Europe broadly from a capital equipment perspective because we've seen some other healthcare companies that sell capital equipment into Europe talk about a tough environment. I was wondering if you could just offer a broad comment on Europe from a capital equipment perspective and then also on the O-U.S. knee business. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Sure, Bob. So on both businesses, I would tell you we don't have significant businesses, as you probably know. In capital equipment in Europe, our market share is quite low. And even for knees, if you look at last year, we had a pretty good comp. We had a plus-5% in knee. And quarter to quarter, given that we don't have very large businesses for both capital equipment in Europe and knees, we do tend to see fluctuations. So I would call this sort of the normal fluctuations that we get quarter to quarter. And we're not really seeing a lot of difficulty with capital equipment. That market for us in Europe, given that the bulk of our capital is not the large capital, we're not really seeing any new pressures. And we see the Europe market as being fairly healthy, at least for our businesses. Keep in mind, though, that we do have very low market shares and we have significant room to grow within both Europe as well as O-U.S. knees. Bob Hopkins : And then on emerging markets, I think the last couple of quarters, the business has been, as you expected, down about mid-single digits. Was that the same sort of growth rate that you saw this particular quarter? And can you just give us a little more color on the math and rationale for the expectation that perhaps in the back half, things get a little bit better? Kevin Lobo : So Bob, the emerging markets actually was -- the decrease was even more pronounced in the first quarter, so it was negative high-single digits in the first quarter. And that didn't surprise us because we had a very strong first quarter last year. Things really started to tail off starting in the second quarter last year. So that really contributed to the softness in our international sales was the negative growth in emerging markets and we do see that starting to taper and obviously the comps will ease as well. Inventory bleeds will eventually bleed out. It's hard to predict exactly when, but as I stated I think on our last call, we expect around midyear would be sort of the bottoming out period and we should start to see improvements in the second half of the year. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. You may proceed. Rick Wise : Kevin, you've been very pointed in focusing us on the potential for more operating leverage in the P&L. We saw it this quarter with 90 basis points of positive leverage. When I look back at the last couple of years, you've had a couple of quarters where we have seen 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, but then it's not sustained. How do we think about this performance in the first quarter? Is it sustainable, is there more to come and is that the right way to think about the 2016, 2017 direction in terms of driving leverage? Kevin Lobo : I would tell you that if you look at our earnings guidance, it's pretty clear that we're driving leverage. So we've updated both our top-line guidance. We've also updated our bottom-line guidance. And this is the third time since the beginning of the year that we've raised our earnings guidance and we won't be able to deliver that type of earning guidance unless we drive operating leverage. So I'm not going to promise that is going to be 90 basis points every single quarter, but we're committed to driving leverage at the operating income level. And you will see that this year and you'll see that when we provide guidance for you in 2017. Rick Wise : And just following up on the knee performance which was really excellent clearly, I know there are multiple pieces here, Triathlon is doing well, revision. Maybe remind us of your current mix of revision versus primary knee, that mix. How does it differ from industry averages or aspirational norms? And is the story in knees, at least in part, the new products you showed us at AOS are going to drive us toward those norms? Or how should we think about it? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Sure, yes. There are multiple factors that contribute to the knee performance. We had a great fourth quarter, with around 9% growth in the U.S. and another 9% in the first quarter. And certainly revision is part of it. And we've launched these new 3D-printed cones in the middle of last year and cones are a very important part of the procedure. They don't generate huge revenue by themselves, but you get the pull-through of the implant when you use the cones.  Our market share was roughly 6 share points below what it was in primary knees and revision. So we did sell in the revision market, but we didn't maintain the same level of market share that we do with our primary knees, roughly 6 points. So we're really excited about being able to gain those 6 points back and then potentially even grow beyond that. Because we really believe we now have the best-in-class cones for revision procedures. We also have cementless knees which is growing and that is through a launch of our 3D-printed Tritanium baseplate. The baseplate portion of our knee system, that's a second factor. A third factor is really great sales force execution. Marketing programs and sales force execution. So it's hard for me to describe which of those three is the greater. I would say all three contributed to a very strong showing in knees and it's the second quarter in a row. And I really believe we're building momentum and that will continue to perform well in knees through the course of the year. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. David Roman : I was hoping you could talk about the trauma business in the U.S. and Kevin, that's a franchise that you have mentioned in a couple different public settings that you weren't convinced that you could necessarily outgrow the market to the extent to which you have over the past several quarters. But that does look like it is continuing here, especially in the U.S. Can you maybe just help us think through some of the drivers that are supporting the sustainability of growth in that franchise? And how we should evaluate that on a go-forward basis? Kevin Lobo : Look, I'm thrilled with the performance of our trauma business and it's been a multiyear success story. We posted this plus-11% against a comp of plus-18% in the prior period, so we really are clicking on all cylinders within our trauma portfolio. It took us years to build out our portfolio, frankly, on the plating side of the business. We've always been strong in nails and then of course the launching of our foot and ankle business was tremendous a few years ago and that continues to grow above the overall trauma growth rate. It was midteens growth again this quarter. And very strong performance from the STAR Ankle as well, so I would say it's rounding out our portfolio and then terrific sales force execution. And again, it's been a three-year story. My only caution on trauma is really being able to maintain 15%, 16% growth quarter after quarter for years is just challenging. The law of numbers at some point you would think would start to catch up with you and just moderate the growth rate. But I have every confidence we will continue to grow above market and we demonstrated that most likely in the first quarter. Of course, not everybody has reported yet, but we feel that's a very strong showing. David Roman : Maybe just a follow-up on the cash flow side for Glenn, if I look at the operating cash flow and free cash flow numbers that you've disclosed for the quarter, it looks like quite a bit of capital deployed toward operating items and you are not converting all that much of your net income to free cash flow. Are there any one-time factors that may have negatively influenced Q1 that would reverse themselves through the balance of the year, whereby you can start growing cash flow in line with adjusted net income? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, the biggest thing that we really we can't necessarily control the timing of is really the Rejuvenate payments that we made related to the recall. So we made a payment of $0.1 billion in Q1 and don't expect that based on what we've seen in the past that that could necessarily repeat itself throughout the year. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. You may proceed. Richard Newitter : I was hoping start off with spine. Kevin, can you give us any color on -- you've had two quarters now or three quarters of improving growth there above the market. I know you have some new product launches and a nice pipeline and that is I'm sure helping. Can you break out for us at all is the acceleration that carried over into the first quarter volume related, mix related? Are you getting share or is it just purely you have new products and you are getting premium pricing? Kevin Lobo : I would say it's mostly volume. There is obviously some mix when you launch innovative products. We just had a limited launch of our 3D-printed interbody device and we're getting fantastic feedback on that. And that obviously sells at a price premium. So there is a mix of components as well, but I would say it's mostly volume. And it is volume coming from the products that most of which we launched last year. We launched a slew of new products and those are being well adopted in the marketplace. I would say price continues to be pressured. Spine is the most pressured pricing division within Stryker and we believe that our price is roughly in line with the market. So the fact that we're growing above market now I think is four quarters in a row is really driven by a renewed focus on launching products and having great sales force execution. So I believe we will have another strong year just like we did last year in spine in 2016. Richard Newitter : Okay. And then just one more on bundled payments. It's officially kicked off now that we're in April. Just wondering if you had any updates on ways or areas where you are working with or partnering with hospitals or how you are leveraging something that is unique about what Stryker can do in terms of partnering? Is there anything that you are doing more aggressively or hearing from customers that is resonating or allowing you to potentially differentiate and gain share with this new dynamic that's playing out in the market? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Sure. So we have a division within Stryker called Stryker Performance Solution which has consulted with over 100 hospitals the past three years to improve service line performance, including areas directly impacted by bundled payments. So through these engagements, we've developed deep insight into the profitability and opportunities that hospitals have within orthopedics. We were also granted convener status by CMS last year as part of the bundled payment BPCI program. And we're actively taking risk with five institutions across multiple hospitals on the payment bundling, managing over $55 million in episode spend. With CJR, third parties like us are not allowed to operate as a convener anymore with the Medicare program. But our Stryker Performance Solution is still providing consulting services to hospitals to help them address the challenges of managing the bundle. So we have a lot of experience. We're continuing to help and consult with our customers. And what I tell you is the initial focus is really much more on the post-acute care. That's where the majority of the cost of the procedure is and the biggest opportunity in the short term is addressing post-acute care. But having this division which is headquartered in Chicago, has been a key asset for us. We have a lot of insights into the economics of the orthopedic service line and how to help our customers address this new world. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. You may proceed. Matt Taylor : I was wondering in the last couple quarters, you've actually had better pricing or less declines. Has there been any change in the market where you would really call a trend, whether it is consolidation or new products broadly that have helped on price? Katherine Owen : Yes, I would say obviously pricing is still negative. It is modestly less negative coming in at 1.3%, but we're still very close to the 1.5% to 2% range. So we wouldn't call out anything significant that is indicative of a change in the overall pricing dynamic. Typically consolidation helps, but again it's still negative. We have seen it vary quarter to quarter. Sometimes it's trended above. Fortunately, more recently, it's been trending on the lower end. I would say the outlook seems very stable and really no new dynamics that we see putting further pressure on pricing. Matt Taylor : The other thing people talk about with CCJR is just more procedures moving to outpatient or just getting people out in the hospital quicker or moving to lower acuity settings. So I guess you mentioned your consulting division, but how else are you positioning yourself or is your product portfolio positioned to capture that trend or be competitors in that kind of vector? Katherine Owen : I really think the way we're best positioned to help our customers is going to be through some of the insights that we've had, having this division now for a number of years within Stryker and understanding the economics. And the focus on post-acute care, given that eats up the bulk of the cost when you are looking at an episode of care. So we're able to work with them in that regard. But I wouldn't say there is a unique product offering that facilitates or is advantageous in the post-acute setting, if I'm understanding the question correctly. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed. Matthew O'Brien: Just to follow up a little bit on Matt's question on the CJR, I am curious if there's been any kind of either disruption from that program going into place earlier this month, be it with MAKO. Or potentially here in Q2, maybe seeing a little less volume as a result or if maybe some hospitals as they were preparing for it started to do more cases in Q1 and there was a benefit, specifically in Q1, in anticipation of that program going into place. Kevin Lobo : No, I wouldn't describe any of the change in Q1 to the CJR. Keep in mind that CJR is not impacting a large portion of the procedures, at least in the short term. It doesn't include Medicare Advantage, it doesn't include Medicaid, it doesn't include commercial payers, it doesn't include the hospitals that were already signed up for the BPCI program. So it's obviously certain MSAs that are required to participate, but it's very small and there aren't any penalties in the short term. So I wouldn't get overly concerned about this. It's not a new thing. Bundled payments have been around for a while. They are not brand-new. It's now mandatory in certain MSAs, but I don't really see that as a catalyst to changing behavior in any meaningful way, at least not in the short term. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. And just to follow-up on that, Kevin, was there any slowdown potentially on the MAKO system side that was I think down year over year, just in anticipation of CJR? Hospitals trying to figure out how that program is going to play out. Maybe some of those facilities deciding just to pause on it? Kevin Lobo : No, I would say no. I think our order book is really strong for robot sales and our procedure growth was very robust, both in UKnees and in hips. And that's not new, the hip procedure growth was very strong in the back half of last year. So no, I would not say that there was some kind of change in behavior. We're really seeing continued growth and I am very bullish on our MAKO business. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. And then as my follow-up, just on the domestic performance again, this quarter was extremely strong. I am just wondering with Q1 typically being a seasonally soft quarter and the strength that we're seeing here, obviously comping on ACA, it just seems interesting to me how strong everything has been. Can you just talk about volume price, mix, share taking, what's driving all that strength domestically? And then should we think about things in the U.S. slowing down in the back half, with OU.S. picking up and then exiting into 2017 hopefully with both of those segments starting to realize more normalized type growth? Kevin Lobo : I think we're going to continue to see strong performance in the U.S. Obviously, this was a very big quarter, but the real genesis of this is fantastic product pipelines. We have across our businesses, very, very good condition of our pipeline with many new launches that are just starting, launches that started in middle of last year. So having healthy product pipeline is always great and that leverages our best asset which is our sales forces of Stryker which really know how to execute. And we have health across our divisions. And that wasn't the case a few years ago. We had a few divisions that were a little bit softer. We now have strength in our endoscopy with our new camera. We have strength within our neuro-powered instruments. We have the human stroke market taking off, we have a strong pipeline within spine. You are seeing the 3D-printed implants taking off. So really across our portfolio, we have very strong pipelines. So that isn't a one quarter thing. I think we will continue to see strong performance through the course of the year. And we continue to spend very robustly in R&D, so we have a cadence of new products that will continue. And so I really believe this is sustainable. We will continue to perform very well in the U.S. It's not a one quarter thing. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed. Mike Matson : I guess, Katherine, I just wanted to ask about the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Should we expect the growth rates to continue this year at the historical levels, so sort of double-digits at Sage and mid-single digits at Physio-Control? Or is there a risk that the growth tapers off a little bit while you are integrating those companies? Katherine Owen : Recognizing there's always integration that has to happen, so I don't want my comments to be construed as exact targets for every quarter. But overall, Sage has a long history of sustaining very strong double-digit growth. And our goal, as I mentioned, is to make sure we do everything to continue to support them and over time unlock more of the opportunity outside the U.S. Physio-Control is embarking this year on a hefty new product launch cycle that will go for the next two years. So I think your estimations are a good place to be thinking about and again, we will be very transparent. We're going to give pro forma revenue performance for each business, respectively, for the first 12 months. So you will be able to see very clearly how they are growing relative to the prior-year base. Mike Matson : And then just with regard to the emerging markets and I guess China more specifically, can you just talk about the differences in what you're seeing with regard to the implant markets and the procedurally driven products versus the capital equipment markets? Do you have any sense as to whether or not the actual end markets for procedure volumes have slowed down? Or is that just steady and there's just some destocking going on at the distributors? Kevin Lobo : So I break it into three categories. I would say that the slowest impact and the greatest negative impact to us has been in the capital equipment. Then next would be spine and trauma which is -- a lot of that is tendered type of business where we've seen the distributors really had loaded up and are bleeding their inventory. And then the least negatively impacted would be in the hip and knee category which has a lot more cash pay and so the cash pay market is the least impacted. So I put it in those three buckets and obviously, it's all negative with varying degrees. With capital being the most negative, spine trauma second and then hips and knees last. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen : First, I wanted to ask about trauma and extremities and then I had one on M&A. So Kevin, trauma and extremities has obviously been a stellar performer for you guys for a long time, but the two growth areas that you are not participating in are relatively small and are shoulder and cervical disc. So could you give us an update? I know you launched your shoulders a year or two ago. Give us an update there on what you're seeing and the outlook. And then second, how attractive is the cervical disc market to you and how important is it to have a cervical disc market? And I had one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Sure. So shoulder, you are right. We're a relatively small player, but we're very pleased with the launch of our primary shoulder and our reverse shoulder which we launched just over a year ago. That has very nice growth, albeit from a small base, so we really believe we have the right products to be able to win in the market. It's going to take time. This isn't like foot and ankle, where we're approaching new surgeons. We have to be able to take share. But I was very encouraged by the growth the last two quarters in our shoulder business. It doesn't really make a big impact in our overall business, just given the size, but I feel that we now have a very good portfolio and shoulder will become a growth area for us going forward. What is the second question? Larry Biegelsen : On cervical disc, how important it is to have a cervical disc. Kevin Lobo : We would normally report that if we had a cervical disc which we don't right now. That would be reported in our spine business, not in our trauma and extremities business. And right now, our spine business is doing really well. We're launching many, many products. We don't feel that we have to have a cervical disc at the moment to be able to drive growth. It's something we will look at, but at the current time, we don't see that as an impediment to having strong growth in our spine business. Larry Biegelsen : And my apology for wrapping that into trauma and extremities, sorry about that. So Kevin, you spent $4 billion on two recent deals. So my question is how does that impact your ability or willingness to do more deals right until you integrate those two? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Sure. We still have significant capacity to do extra deals. So we had a one-notch downgrade from both S&P and Moody's and if you look at S&P, we went from an A plus to A rating. We're committed to maintaining investment grade, but there's obviously a large gap between A rating and the low end of investment grade. Keep in mind that the vast majority of the deals we do are small tuck-in deals. That will continue to be the case for Stryker. That is where we drive the most value and we find great technologies that we can give to our fabulous sales forces to drive. So you will continue to see -- those will be the majority of deals, but we still have significant capacity to do more M&A and I would say all of our businesses have embedded BD people. We have not told them to slow down at all, so they are continuing to scour the market to look for opportunities that will add value. And we won't hesitate to pull the trigger on new deals if we believe they will be value-creating for Stryker. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Matt Keeler : I guess just to start on Sage, you highlighted the potential to build that in Western Europe. And I was wondering if you could help us think about that market opportunity. Is that a market similar in size in Western Europe to the U.S. and Sage just has a smaller market share or is that a market that you will be building from scratch? Katherine Owen : This will be much more building the market, much the way Sage did in the U.S. They really were -- is a driving force behind the innovations that allowed solutions to many of these hospital-acquired infections. These very elegant, easy-to-use solutions with demonstrated clinical data that shows when they are routinely used and they can significantly limit the occurrence -- the same conditions, hospital-acquired pneumonia infections, are prevalent around the world. It just was not an area they focused on, given their initial investment in the U.S. market. So this will be market development. It will be using the sales force as they do to help drive that, but it's -- very much the same conditions exist, but it will be much more about market expansion which is why we say over time, this is the value we look to unlock and it's not something that's going to occur suddenly in 2016. This will be a multiyear process to really start to drive awareness and adoption. Matt Keeler : And my follow-up, last quarter, you shared some margin targets for the year. Just wondering if you will give us an update on what those will look like with Sage and Physio-Control. Katherine Owen : So we provide top-line and earnings guidance. We don't provide specific margin guidance, although as Glenn noted on the call, while the magnitude of the year-over-year increase in gross margin won't continue, we should continue to be at the Q1 levels for 2016. But we haven't given specific guidance. We do expect margin expansion that is inclusive of the deals as they closed in early April, but beyond that and the -- upward to the targets today, there is nothing additional. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Glenn Novarro : Two questions, one, U.S. knees and hips for Stryker came in better. Yesterday, J&J also reported a much stronger U.S. and knee/hip number. So the market is likely coming in better. But Kevin, I just wanted to see what your view is on the competitive dynamics. Zimmer and Biomet sales forces have combined as of last year. But I'm just wondering, are you still possibly seeing disruption in the marketplace associated with Zimmer and Biomet? And could that be helping your results as well as J&J's results yesterday? Then I have a follow-up. Katherine Owen : So we're really pleased with our result, particularly our U.S. performance, in both hips and knees. At this point, with the largest player having not yet reported along with other competitors in the market, it's very difficult to make any kind of call with conviction around market growth. So clearly, we will have a much better sense as additional numbers roll in where the overall market growth is, but we feel very comfortable in the U.S. that we grew at the high end, if not above the market, but we will have to wait to see how numbers come in to get a general sense of whether there's been any type of acceleration. Keep in mind in recon, you really have to look at rolling four quarter trends because growth rates can vary quarter to quarter. So I wouldn't want to read too much into an uptick in growth to the degree we see one in the first quarter, because it may not be indicative of a trend line. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then one last follow-up on CJR, one, of the pushback that we get is there is a thought out there that surgeons will start cherry-picking patients, that they may not do the more challenging cases and then they may fall through the system. Our due diligence does not suggest that will happen, but I just wanted to hear your opinion. Katherine Owen : Yes, this is obviously gotten a lot of focus of late. I would tell you we do not believe that CMS's intent is to reduce utilization. It's really rather to ensure that each patient has access to their most appropriate care. There has been the speculation, but of some type of step-function reduction in volumes as higher-risk patients are increasingly denied surgeries. We believe that it's unlikely. We do think based on all the work we've done through SPS and obviously our presence in recon that surgeons are going to continue to look to optimize treatment for higher-risk patients. They do that today and this will include managing their post-acute care which can vary. So they have and are going to continue to treat all types of patients. The data clearly shows hip and knee surgery has a very high long term success rate and significantly improves quality of life. And that's for all patients, not just the healthiest ones. So we're not expecting some type of significant change, but rather we do believe they are going to look to find the optimum ways to treat these patients, including the post-acute care regimen. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. You may proceed. Kaila Krum : So a follow-up on Rich's earlier question on spine. Just to dig in a bit further, you mentioned that you are seeing an increase in volume. Can you give us a sense for where you believe that increase in volume is coming from? Is it more market-related or do you think that you are taking share? And if it is the latter, I'm curious as to whether or not that share taking is coming from the bigger players in that segment or from some of the smaller pure plays. Katherine Owen : Yes, we think overall, the market might be modestly improving. But again, it is very difficult today because we're one of the earlier companies to report results. So we will have to see how all the numbers come in and it is also is going to vary by company which segment of the market more of your products are weighted towards. So overall, we've been launching a number of new products, we've talked about the investments we've made over the last couple years in the R&D pipeline and we think this is mostly indicative of us gaining more market share back. Kevin Lobo : Yes, we've seen in the spine market, whether it is small players or larger players, innovation drives growth. And innovation is what takes market share. And our innovation engine is alive and well in our spine business and that's what's caused us to grow above the market. Kaila Krum : Okay. And then I'm just curious if you guys had any differences in terms of selling days in the quarter that may have impacted growth in the quarter? And if so, that estimated impact. Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, no. Selling days are equal between last year and this year. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed. Kyle Rose : Just had one question on MAKO, you've talked a lot about refining the processes in the workflow over the course of 2016 to prepare for the launch in 2017. When you think about that, how do you think about the optimal time of a procedure and the trade-off of being potentially time additive? And I guess the real question is when you come to market with the MAKO Total Knee, what percentage of that market from a volume basis do you think the system will be time neutral to your high-volume or to your medium-volume search? What is the real market segment that the MAKO is really targeting here? Katherine Owen : Sure. So much of the data you are looking for, we're going to be able to track once we go into full commercial launch. And it is going to vary by surgeon. A really high-volume surgeon doing hundreds of knee replacements a year is going to -- this is going to be time additive. For the lower-volume surgeon, they are going to get much closer to time neutral. But it's also why we wanted to spend our time on the training protocol to really look at ways that we can optimize this with this first-generation product. The other key is this is not just about time. We believe we're going to truly improve the patient experience. We're going to have a more reproducible surgery, because there tends to be tremendous variation, particularly with lower-volume surgeons. We think we can improve muscle disruption and things that add to the fact that close to 30% of knee patients are dissatisfied with the procedure. So it's really not just about time, it is truly about having an experience that is better for the surgeon, better for the patient and over time, we believe the outcomes data will support that. Kyle Rose : And then just another question on the robotic side, we've heard a lot of thoughts and rumblings about robotics in the spine market. In particular, more of a play on navigated pedicle screw placement. Just your general thoughts on that, given your overlap in the spine, as well as presence from a capital equipment side and navigation and then how does, if any is the MAKO -- your robot play a factor in those plans moving forward. Kevin Lobo : So certainly, we have a terrific navigation business unit. That is within our instruments business and so we're very well aware of how that procedure gets done, whether it's with navigation or not. That continues to be a growth area for us, both the neuro and spine market. But we're in the next few years really focused on hip and knees with MAKO. We have a lot of work to do to get the Total Knee. We think that is a killer procedure. I think if you look down the road, five-plus years, certainly spine could be an area of interest. Hip arthroscopy could be an area of interest. Shoulder could be an area of interest. So there are many areas -- I think robotics will be a growth area for many, many years to come. But first things first, we really have to focus on hips and knees and that's where our attention will be for the next few years. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. You may proceed. Amit Hazan : Maybe just start on hip and knee side, U.S. volumes. I want to maybe take a big picture market view for a moment. When we look and analyze the market models, some of your competitors' data, it seems pretty clear that hip width and volumes have been really strong for a couple years now, maybe up in the 6%, 7%, 8% range for the market as a whole in the U.S. That would be well above the 10-year plus average for volumes. So I'm wondering what you think has been the driver of that over these last couple years. And perhaps more importantly, the extent to which you think that is sustainable on the volume side. Kevin Lobo : Yes, no, we're seeing a very stable market. Just look at demographics, every day in the 10,000 people over 65, more and more people are talking to friends that have had hip and knee replacement. The results are fabulous. People want to be active. So actually, we're seeing a lot -- certainly we see this with the UKnee with MAKO. We see a lot of young people going in for surgery, that wasn't happening before. You are seeing unemployment is a great proxy. When we see unemployment come down, we tend to see a lot more joint replacement, specifically knees. So hips really hurt, even when you lie down at night. Knees, you can defer and so we see that as a very good proxy. That is much more of a proxy than anything to do with ACA. So we really believe we've got a stable market that will continue to be stable for not just the next quarter, but for the next year or two years. And demographics is a key part, patient awareness is a key part and people wanting to be active. A lot of people want to be active and so we don't really see -- from a demand or volume standpoint, we don't see any headwinds right now. And frankly, the lower unemployment is a little bit of tailwind. Amit Hazan : And then kind of back to MAKO and bundled payments, maybe just kind of asking a question in a different way to throw it out to you guys. What is the sales pitch for MAKO in a bundled payment environment? Essentially, how does MAKO fit into a 90-day [indiscernible] care better -- in a better way than what's being done here traditionally, such that it would have added value to the hospital? Kevin Lobo : So we really believe MAKO is going to improve outcomes. If you have consistent, reproducible product placement, less soft tissue damage, you need less rehab for your patient, they are more satisfied -- that's going to win in the market. So it's irrespective of the type of payment, whether it's a single-payer system, like in France, a two-tier system like in the UK or whether we're now -- it's a bundled payment system. So the method of payment is less interesting to us, frankly. If we deliver value and prove that value, we will win in the marketplace. And frankly, when you look at a bundle, again, the implant price and even with the robot, if you factor in the robot. And that is still not the majority of the procedure cost. So there's a lot of room to optimize beyond just the implant and we really believe if we deliver that excellent experience and they have better outcomes that we will be able to win in the marketplace. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W Baird. You may proceed. Jeff Johnson : Katherine, now that we're into April, on the MHLW price reset, can you just confirm now it's probably going to be, what, no more than 20 basis points, 25 basis point impact to your Company-wide pricing? Katherine Owen : Yes, that's a good approximation. Jeff Johnson : And then Kevin, I guess a question for you. I heard the comments on the ankle performance in the quarter. It sounds like that was strong. When ITPS proposals came out the other night, the question -- I hadn't really thought of it until just staring at some of the rates the other night. But with us not getting a carveout on a total ankle replacement code which I don't think anybody really expected that we would again this year. But as you look at the episode of care cost on ankles being higher than hips and knees, but being reimbursed at those same rates and as we go into this bundled payment environment, you think there's any bias or any kind of skew away from ankles that hospitals would maybe take, just as their costs are higher, but reimbursement is the same with -- being paid under those hip and knee codes? Kevin Lobo : So first of all, we're just starting with hip and knee in bundled payments. And I think Medicare is going to be looking at high-volume procedures and moving them into the bundle. Total ankle is a very small part of the total market. Fusion is still the standard of care. Ankles are growing very fast, but from a very small base. So I really don't see this hitting the radar screen, at least not for few years for Medicaid. They've got a lot of other procedures they are going to focus on. I do believe bundled care and bundled payments will increase. It's a good thing for the overall healthcare system, it will address a lot of costs that need to be reduced. Frankly, in the case of hip and knee procedure, there is an over-prescription today on the post-acute. There's a lot of costs and we've seen when we work with hospitals on their service line profitability, that is the area that we tend to focus on the most. So I think we're a long way away from bundled payments having a big impact on total ankle. And frankly, it's a better outcome. So fusion is -- was standard of care in some of the joint replacements a long time ago and that's been replaced by total prosthesis and total ankle will be a better outcome. Of course, like everything in healthcare, finding payments and getting procedures reimbursed always goes through its ups and downs, but if you have a better outcome, eventually, it will get paid. So I don't really see a headwind for that, at least not in the next few years. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Josh Jennings : I just was hoping you could clarify -- it looks like there is a step-up in CapEx in Q1 from the normal run rate. And just the driver behind that. And just linked to that question is any major product launches across the major divisions that you would call out that are going to help with this 5.5% to 6.5% organic growth trajectory? Thanks a lot. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, in Q1, we started some of the spending that is going to be required for our deployment of our new ERP system. And so that is the big thing that kind of stuck out in the cash flow. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And as it relates to product launches -- so we have a number of products that we've talked about, like the signature line of neuro-powered drills that haven't had a full-year impact. But we do have our -- a Neptune 3 launch that is upcoming which is the main waste management product within instruments. That is coming in the middle of the year. That will be a contributor to growth, but I would say it's just a continuation. The camera launch was December. It really was mid-December of last year, the 1588. We're getting great customer feedback, so that will continue going into this year. Sports medicine is launching a number of products. Spine -- the 3D-printed implant -- the interbody device, great feedback, but a very small number of surgeons put those in in the first quarter. So we will expand that launch over the course of the year. So I wouldn't point to one single product. It is just typical of Stryker. We tend to have our growth spread across a wide variety of products, but there are a number of products that will contribute to the growth rate. And obviously raising after one quarter, we have confidence that we will be able to sustain this level of growth. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2016 results will be held on July 21. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Andrea and I will be your operator for today's call. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker CFO; Tim Scannell, Group President, MedSurg and Neurotechnology; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call I will provide opening comments, followed by Tim with an update on our two recent acquisitions, Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg and Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by US, up 9%, while sales outside the US were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China. Beyond the top line achievement, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater SG&A leverage on a multiyear basis with initiatives such as indirect spending, product life cycle management, and the optimization of our IT systems. As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leveraged earning gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per share earnings of $5.70 to $5.80 a share. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon. I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition. As we articulated in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products with disposables targeted at reducing never events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single use versus capital products. Sage's approach to innovation focuses on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes which underscore the benefits of their products, driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly trusted brands, which are an essential part of nurses' daily interactions with patients in hospital ICUs and med-surg units. Sage is number one in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address a segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion. Turning to the financials for Sage, given that we closed the transaction on April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2, with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was one-time in nature and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would have been approximately 14%. Sage's success has been fueled by their commitment to innovation, which has resulted in the long history of successful new product introductions, including the recently launched AirTAP product. Using proprietary air-assisted technology, AirTAP enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by aiding in the turning and boosting of patients while the patients remain in bed. AirTAP enhances caregiver safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients, versus a typically used draw sheet. With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to coordinate activities to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brand strategies. Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success in Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we are working to prioritize countries which value proven clinical solutions that eliminate never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage, and expect double digit revenue growth in the second half. Turning to Physio-Control, I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid February, Physio-Control complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative and differentiated pre-hospital and hospital products, as Physio-Control is the leader in the development, manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors, AEDs, and CPR-assist devices. We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the number one or number two share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments totaling approximately $1.7 billion. With Stryker's market leading powered cot and power load lift system coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors, and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchises enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business, compared to our EMS business which is nearly 100% capital. In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive enduring competency in a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launch, with additional product launches slated for the next several years. We expect this refreshed product portfolio and the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum and greater profitability leverage in the future. As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. Pro forma Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure, and our medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength, and operational infrastructure. We expect high single digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half. With these two acquisitions, the medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically, and has more base business. Encouragingly, medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result while integrating these two acquisitions. This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Tim. I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded the high end of the range of our full-year expectations despite a tough year-over-year comparison with growth of 6.9% in the year ago quarter. The quarter included one additional selling day compared to prior year and consistent with our previous communications, the additional selling day equates to approximately 1% of additional growth. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, trending modestly better than we expected. During the quarter, we continued to see strong US sales with organic growth of 8.6%, while international sales posted organic growth of 2%, reflecting continued destocking challenges in China. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 15.8% from the prior year, primarily driven by our strong top line growth, including the impact from the acquisitions completed in the quarter. Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter. Looking at our segment highlights, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by US Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in trauma and extremities and a 6.8% growth in knees, as momentum continued for our 3D printed Tritanium revision cones and our cementless knee products. US hips posted low single digit growth due to softness in the revision market. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European knee business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio. Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our US MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8% with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double digit gains in our Micro Power tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1 with US growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 1588 AIM video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had US growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its Power cot products as well as solid performance of our bed business. Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China, primarily related to distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive end customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories. Neurotechnology and spine posted constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5% with continued strong momentum our neurotech businesses, which increased 14.4% while spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, US neurotech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our neurovascular products, the Trevo stent retriever and Target coil, our neuropowered instruments and our craniomaxillofacial fixation products. Our US spine business grew 4.8% despite experiencing product supply issues, but continues to see good demand for our newer 3D printed Tritanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, neurotech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the Trevo stent retriever and Target coil products. Spine's international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China. Moving on to general operating highlights, our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassifications between gross margin and SG&A to align to Stryker policies, sales mix, and negative pricing. As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix, and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our CTG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%. Lastly, I will provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure partially offset by the impact of higher US based income from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 38% was held in the US. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we had previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016 with negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38. And now we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just want to get your thoughts on a couple of items. So number one, understand the guidance update for the year. One of the questions people are asking is just the third quarter is a little bit below where the Street was modeling, so I don't know if as you looked at Street models if there was anything in particular you thought the Street was off on relative to your expectations. And then second, the mix of growth was a little bit different this quarter if I look at Orthopaedics and MedSurg within those different businesses. Maybe there's a couple you want to comment on. There's a few that stick out to me, but I would just love to get your thoughts. Thanks. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. I'll take the first one. So as we look at Q3, seasonally Q3 is usually our softest quarter. I think if you look at our guidance, it's very consistent with our Q3 guidance that we've provided in the past, especially when you look at year-over-year growth. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And as to the second question, Mike, this is Kevin. I would say that from quarter to quarter you see this kind of change at Stryker, and we've seen this for the past few years where in the first quarter Orthopaedics had a more robust performance. This quarter was led by MedSurg. From quarter to quarter we see those variations. But what's encouraging to me is if you look at our growth versus the market, we continue to perform very well, especially if you look on a rolling four quarters basis. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And maybe just a couple more, Kevin, just to comment on. If I look at within different businesses, maybe some that were a bit surprising was maybe international spine, which you made some comments relative to the Orthopaedics business. There was some surprises like US hips was less than what we thought. Knees was pretty close. But there were some, relative to what we saw in the first quarter, there were some pretty good swings within the business model. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah so Mike, look, I'll just finish by saying in China we've had issues and challenges, and we've highlighted those in the past. That affected spine. That affected our endoscopy division. That affected our trauma division. Spine had some product supply issues which affected both our US spine business as well as our O-US spine business. And hips, as you pointed out, was a little softer this quarter, but we've led the market certainly in the US for multiple years in our hip business and it's just one quarter. So there's for me no concern there. We see these changes from quarter to quarter. And as you've seen, the resiliency of our top line quarter after quarter over the past three or four years has been very steady. So yes, there were a bit of swings this quarter, but nothing that causes me any reason for concern. We have very, very strong divisions across the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks and good afternoon. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Hi, Bob. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Bob. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Bob. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just a couple things to follow up on. One, just a little more color maybe on the US hips, recognize that you've been strong and it's just one quarter. But Kevin, you mentioned that you felt it was a soft revision market. So you feel like there was something going on with the revision market this quarter. So I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color there. And also now that we're one quarter into CJR, maybe any thoughts from the field in terms of what you're seeing, client reaction, thoughts on how things are developing there. Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Hey, Bob, it's Katherine. Just a couple points. I wouldn't look at the quarter and say something particular was going on in revisions versus primary. Overall, it was a bit softer than we've seen. And much like the first quarter, it was a bit stronger than we typically see, but we're not hearing anything from the field, from our customers, that suggests something's changed. It really reinforces why you've heard us say over and over we're really focused on rolling four quarter trends, because we see this quarter to quarter variability, that taken as a whole when you look back, doesn't mean anything significant in terms of changes in underlying fundamentals. And we're not seeing anything different in this quarter other than it was obviously a weaker than normal versus Q1 being a stronger than normal quarter. In terms of CJR, as you know it went into effect April 1. We haven't seen any impact. I think it's simply too early. As you know there's no penalty until after the first full year. So it's just simply too early, but nothing has played out yet in terms of a significant change or impact on the market. Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then two other things I wanted to touch on. One was just maybe comment on gross margin. In Q1 we talked about thinking about 68% for the rest of the year and just would like to understand some of the moving parts that you were highlighting in the prepared comments. And then lastly as it relates to the deals, sounds like things are going well, Tim. Previously you guys had suggested that $0.15 to $0.18 of accretion in 2017 was a good preliminary estimate. I was wondering, from what you see today, is that still a good preliminary way of thinking about things? Or is that perhaps a conservative estimate? Thank you. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Bob, this is Glenn. First of all, if you look at the sequential drop in margin Q1 to Q2, roughly 180 basis points, I mean Q2 was really impacted by mix especially, but not just sales mix but by adding in the acquisitions. It's early and our acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year, and it impacted more than just product. We made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting practices with our accounting practices. And this essentially shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to align them with how Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that, and we don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out. And then on top of that, I really just need to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around. Not just price, but FX, geographic mix really impact it. And all of those are pretty hard to forecast to sort of a single point estimate. As I think about for the rest of the year and what you should maybe think about for your model, I think we'll be in the range of this 67% range, but understand that it could trend above or below that based on all those factors that I just mentioned. Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: And Bob, on the deals, this is Tim speaking. The accretion assumptions you cited look good. We're on track, and we would expect you could assume those to be good moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, just to I guess go back to Bob's question on the accretion from the deal. How should we just think about I guess that accretion? Should we think about that as flowing through? I realize it's still very early compared to, think about next year, but should we think about that baseline growth? I know we've talked about this in previous calls. Or should we think about that as still a little too soon to dial in accretion above what has been generally a double digit baseline growth for you? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Hey Kristen, I think it's very consistent with how we've messaged before. This is obviously going to be one of the variables that gets factored in as we go through our 2017 budgeting process. But clearly, it's incremental accretion above and beyond the normal earnings power of the businesses as they stand. How much of that flows through to the bottom line, how much of that we reinvest as we think about the opportunities in front of us, all of that will get factored in and will be evident when we give the range. So I wouldn't want to say it's a one for one, just throw it on all top of a normal earnings number because we have to look at the opportunities for reinvestment, recognizing obviously it's also incremental accretion and so some portion of it is likely to play out at the bottom line as well. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, and then just generally on the market trends. I was curious from a competitive standpoint now that we've had a couple quarters on which I guess Zimmer is through with its integration of Biomet, and we've seen J&J come pick up its momentum within hips and knees. I was wondering if you guys could just comment broadly if you're seeing I guess what other companies are saying in terms of them getting their momentum back. Any particular changes that have been affecting you? And perhaps on the hip side, is this a reflection of some of the other companies getting their steam or is it just simply you feel just the revision market softening? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, I would say again it's just a quarter that was incrementally weaker versus quarters like the first quarter where it felt stronger, but we couldn't point to any discernible change or inflection point that suggested we had a new higher growth market. The only ones that reported are us and J&J so we have pretty limited visibility until everybody else reports, but we're not seeing or hearing anything that suggests that you're seeing some dramatic market share shifts. It's generally not how things play out in the recon market. So again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest that there's anything different than the normal quarterly variability that we see play out. Obviously it's more fun when it's Q1 and it's incrementally stronger. But again, that's why we focus on the rolling four quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just a few questions maybe starting with Kevin. Kevin, just with the extra selling day here in the second quarter, and thinking about the easier comps in the back half of the year, by our math, your guidance for the remainder of the year implies stable comp adjusted growth for the back half of the year. Is that just kind of roughly how you see the business stability on an underlying basis into the back half of the year? Or are there chances for acceleration or deceleration? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So David, since the beginning of the year, this is the second time we've moved our range upwards. And we've been delivering very strong growth throughout the year, yes. In China, and even all the emerging markets our comps will ease in the second half of the year, but we also have some challenging comps in some of our other businesses that were growing very robustly in the second half of the year. So it's a big business that we're managing, and I think if you're growing north of 6% organically while you're integrating acquisitions, I think you're doing pretty well. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. We would agree. Glenn, I think you've gotten questions on margins. But I think this particular quarter, it's sort of the mirror image of first quarter, where growth's a little weaker, SG&A control's a little better. I know you had some announcements on the ERP integration during the quarter. Can you just give us an update on where you are and sort of the ERP planning and what's the opportunity for savings for shareholders on the ERP, and when we may get an update on that number? And I have one quick follow-up. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, David, on ERP is one thing that we're focusing on relative to our CTG program. It has several facets. I would say we're in the pretty early stages of our ERP program. Obviously, when you're implementing a new commercial global footprint, it's a multiyear journey. And we're in the early stages of that. So we'll definitely keep you guys updated as that project moves forward. I think the more immediate term things to think about are indirect procurement and those parts of the project that really can have more of an impact as we roll forward in the next year. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, David, what we've been signaling on our cost transformation is this is really the engine of being able to sustain leveraged earnings year after year. And so in the earlier years, you are going to see more of that savings coming through from indirect procurement and in the later years you are going to see more of that saving coming from product life cycle management and coming from the ERP benefits. But I would say it's been a real rallying force for the company, to have everybody, all the different divisions of Stryker, working on a common system which is going very, very well. And it's a shift to SAP from a company that has really no SAP today. But I'm very encouraged with the early progress and I'm very optimistic about the implementation. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then Katherine, just one last quick one here. The neurotech number, obviously very, very strong and obviously the driver partially is the ischemic market. I feel like in the last couple of quarters, you and your competitors have shifted away, and they're much more focused on market development from here. I wonder if you could just share with us what specifically is Stryker doing on the market development front to drive that market. And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah David, we have been for some time been messaging around the market development. But with Tim here who runs that business, I'm going to pass it over to him. Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: Yeah, there was a variety of initiatives out there where we're simply partnering with systems, healthcare systems, hospitals, to drive patient flow to the right centers where they're performing these procedures. It will be a multiyear process and hospitals all vary in their level of maturity, but it's a very real and big challenge to get these patients to the right centers. But our efforts surround largely education, trying to assist, trying to ask the right questions, trying to connect people with the right consultants, things like that, and make sure their stroke centers are properly operating and they're getting the patients from the ER to the cath or the interventional lab to treat these patients. So it takes many forms. It takes many years, but I think what we're seeing is steady progress chipping away, but it's going to be years and years and years of efforts here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good evening, Kevin, and hello everybody. Maybe starting off with MAKO. In an oblique way you talked about you had solid US knee numbers. Where are you in the total knee rollout from MAKO? You didn't call out MAKO as a positive factor driving knee volumes in the US. Is it a factor? Just remind us where you are in those timelines with commercialization and papers and what's next for MAKO? Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah thanks, Rick. This is Kevin. So, today MAKO is not a huge driver because we're really in the knee business, just using it for unicompartmental knees. We do have a limited launch, and the accent is the word limited. Just a small number of surgeons who are doing total knees. Early feedback has been very positive, so we're encouraged. But the reason for the limited launch is to make sure that we work out all the workflow and define training protocols and also be able to have some publications and podium presentations. The full launch in the total knee is not until next year. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So you know, maybe turning to Tim and Physio. Tim, you talked about high single digit second half growth for Physio, but you also underscored the pipeline and the products coming. Can you give us any more color on the pipeline? What do we expect? When do we see it? And does that accelerate or sustain that kind of high single digit growth pace for Physio? Thank you. Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: Rick, I would say it would sustain that high single digit growth rate. I think what I said after the deal was announced was that it would be accretive to Stryker's sales growth rate. And I would expect over the next several years to see next generation products in each of three main categories, defibrillators and monitors, AEDs or automated external defibrillators, and circulatory assist devices. This market is now turning into a PMA market in the United States, and so these launches will be global in nature and vary in timing by market. So we're not going to be overly specific about it, but I would say we expect, again over the next four to five years, to have a consistent stream of new products which would drive that accretive sales growth out of the Physio division versus Stryker. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions on Sage. First, can you give us some more color on the supply disruption in the quarter, what happened there? Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: On the supply disruption, from time to time each of our businesses may have some issues. In this case it was one transient in nature. It's over and that's about as far as we're going to go in terms of sharing details. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And then what's the timeline to build out Sage's presence internationally? You talked about a little bit in Europe and Canada initially. With the rest of the business, can you drop those products in your bag internationally and start to see some synergies in the next few quarters? Or is this going to be a protracted process where there are regulatory and tenders that have to go through before you really start to see that? Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: I think it will be a longer term process. As we've seen with all our international initiatives, it does take time. And so we do have a foothold in Europe and Canada as we talked about. Areas like Australia may be fertile ground but will take a while. Other areas like Japan will take even longer in terms of regulatory pathways. So we see great opportunity, but it's going to be a multiyear journey for sure. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one quick one, if I could, on China. Do you guys have any visibility at this point where inventory levels stand and what your underlying growth in that market might be, excluding these drawdowns? Just to give us a sense of how close we might be to seeing a turn there. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so what we've been saying now for the past few quarters is we did expect this to be a very soft quarter in China, so it was in line with our expectations. We do expect sometime in the back half of the year that we'll start to reach bottom and that we'll return to growth. We don't have the precision, just based on having multiple tiers of distributors, we don't have precision to be able to identify that exactly, but you should see signs of improvement. Certainly while we exit the year and going into next year, we should bottom out sometime in the second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. First on the ex-US knee performance, you mentioned strength in Europe. Can you give us any more color around that? Was that market strength? Are you taking share? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I think at this point it's just tough to know until everybody reports. We add up the numbers similarly and get a better sense of share shift at that point. So there's nothing specific that we would point to. We obviously have better execution now under our TOM model, which has helped a number of our businesses. But we'll know in a couple weeks if there's anything more beyond market growth versus share shift. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's important just to note that we have a few of our businesses that are really underrepresented in Europe, our endoscopy division, our instruments division, and knees, where the market shares that we have are certainly much lower than they are in other parts of the world. So when we produce a good growth number, it's really just sort of getting back towards what we would consider our fair share. And it's a very encouraging sign and we're pleased with some of the hiring that we've done in Europe and starting to build that business. Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. And then just a separate question on neurotech. Growth is very strong in the quarter but it slowed versus last quarter sequentially. Can you give us any color on the sub-segment growth rates in neurovascular and CMF and what drove that slowdown in growth? Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: There would be nothing I would point to. I think, as Katherine has talked about in some other areas, the growth rates can vary. It could be based on comps or different countries that did better or worse, or what have you. I think if we dug down into the numbers, CMF might be up a smidge and neurovascular down a little, but nothing that would point to any dramatic shift. I think in general we've had very, very strong performance and to me the good news is that that continues. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's important to know all three of those groups, so neurovascular is of course the biggest one, the neuro powered tools as well as CMF. They're all double digit growers. And so from quarter to quarter, as Tim mentioned, some are a little higher, some are a little lower. We had a 20% comp almost in the United States from the prior year and we continue to grow strong double digits on top of strong comps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just with Tim in the room, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the MedSurg strength in the quarter. As you were integrating Sage and Physio, did you get any kind of benefit, either from a sentiment perspective from hospitals about adding those businesses? And then as we think about things going forward on an organic basis, now that you can bundle all of these things together, can you still deliver this mid or even upper single digit growth out of MedSurg going forward? Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: Well, to add a little bit of color, first I would say we're delighted with the performance of our medical division in the quarter, that they delivered strong core growth while dealing with the challenges of these two large integrations. Their EMS business did particularly well and they performed nicely in their core bed and stretcher business. Endoscopy is having an excellent year. Their core visualization business is performing exceptionally well with the 1588 camera. The communications business is doing well and the sports business is doing well there as well. I would point back to a couple deals we did in 2014, Berchtold and Pivot. These both are kind of in the mainstream now of being integrated and our team is fully in line with their products. So the Berchtold lights, booms and tables have sold well this year. The Pivot products have done very well in our hands as well. And over at Stryker Instruments, this has been a steady, strong performer over time. Their personal protection and fluid waste management businesses were real highlights in the quarter. We do expect a strong second half there as they'll be launching their Neptune 3 fluid waste management system in the coming days. So, I think across the board we were strong. I would also frankly note the sustainability business had a strong quarter and they've done well with recent product launches. And importantly, reprocessed products from Stryker have been embraced as a high quality solution by our hospital customers despite the fact that that's a challenging and difficult market. I would tell you no, there wasn't really any sentiment in favor of Stryker as a result of these deals, but importantly, we've had strong execution across the board, good new product flow, and we're optimistic about the rest of the year. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Helpful. And then just shifting over to the trauma and extremities business. Still solid performance there, but on a two-year stack basis, that growth rate did decelerate here in Q2 versus the last few quarters. Is there anything going on there competitively of note that could prevent you from sustaining this share taking position you've been in for a while and getting, still outperforming the overall market growth rates, or should we expect more market growth rates from you from trauma and extremities? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Well we feel really pleased with the performance for both trauma and extremities businesses, but obviously the extremities base has gotten much bigger now. So you're looking at more challenging comparables that's still growing very solid double digits. And trauma we continue to see strong performance for that business as well. There hasn't been any meaningful change. We still feel good about the way those businesses are positioned. But obviously the law of large numbers sets in and the comps become more difficult. But beyond that, no. There's nothing we'd really point to. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Keep in mind, we did have a 18% comp in the United States in trauma. So we had a really huge growth in the prior year and still strong growth. We still believe this is going be a growth business for the company. So, and it's just one quarter. It did decelerate a little bit, but certainly a very impressive number nonetheless. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good evening everybody, and thank you. In looking at your spine business, that accelerated a little bit last year, it seemed through innovation and some better execution but slowed down a little bit this year, year to date. How are you thinking about that in terms of internal versus external development? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : You're right. We have invested a lot, in terms of the pipeline, in launching new products. As we mentioned, we did have some supply disruption that will continue into the second half here. As you know, we prioritize M&A across all the businesses, but we also invest in those businesses in order to be able to deliver results based on internal innovation and R&D. So don't think about that business any differently than other areas where we look at opportunities. As you know, we have BD people in all the divisions looking at targets, but also assessing that around opportunities to invest internally and grow the business organically. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would also, I'd just like to repeat what was mentioned earlier that we did have some product disruptions in the quarter in our spine business. The underlying business is in really solid shape. I feel great about the leadership team, the new products. We have some supply challenges and that will continue in the third quarter and then it'll start to improve in the fourth quarter. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. And then just to turn back to the gross margin moment, is there a way to peel this apart a little bit to understand the impact of some of the acquisitions or the recategorization may have had on that? Thank you. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think if you think about the sequential change from Q1 to Q2, acquisitions in total were roughly sort of half of that change. And that should continue through the rest of the year in terms of the total growth, impact on the total gross margin. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Just keep in mind, when you get that hit at the gross margin, those are also lower SG&A businesses, so part of that big impact, the big SG&A decline as a percent of sales in the leverage is the flip side of that, where you're seeing the benefit both from a product mix as well as the reclassifications. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions on Ortho. First, Ortho pricing down 2.2% in 2Q, versus down 1.7% in 1Q. Is there anything unusual happening there, or is that just quarter to quarter fluctuations? And then on robotics, you sold 7 in 1Q, up to 17 in 2Q. Maybe talk about the momentum there with these outright sales and what's the pipeline looking like in terms of robotic deals in the back end of the year? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yes. So to take the first question, no I wouldn't read anything into 1.7% versus 2.2%. It's within the normal variability that we have historically seen, much like total pricing trending less negative, but still within the range of that 1.5% to 2% that we think about. Yes, very pleased with the robot placement and the fact that we have the early observational studies underway in the limited launch. The order book looks strong. We're excited about the outlook there as we prepare, as we talked about, to going to full commercial launch in 2017. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then quick follow-up for Glenn or for you Katherine. You had the extra selling day in 2Q. Is everything normal for 3Q and 4Q? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yes. So if you think about it, there was no difference in selling days in the first quarter, whether you look at it US, O-US, worldwide. Second quarter we had one extra selling day, which equates to 1% impact overall in our businesses. And then Q3, Q4, there's no difference in selling days US, O-US, or worldwide. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Couple questions if I could. So the spine product issue you had in the quarter, perhaps you could provide a little bit more about that. Was that related to the 3D products that you've rolled out or was that something different? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : No. We're not going to get into too many details just for competitive reasons. We do have a supply disruption issue and some supply challenges. We'll work through those in the third quarter. We did highlight the Tritanium product, and a lot of momentum around that, excited about what that product will do for that portfolio. But not going to go into additional details other than to say you should assume the impact lingers into the second half of this year. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just for my second question, Medtronic obviously made some noise in June about coming into the orthopedic market. Curious if you've seen anything, one. And two, if you have any thoughts just around what Medtronic would mean for this market. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : No, we haven't seen any impact and they'd obviously be better positioned to talk about where they are in the launch or signing up customers. So today, no, we don't see any impact. Obviously we believe in the value of the rep and as well as innovation in this market and we're really going to focus on just that and the MAKO total knee launch, which we think has the opportunity to be truly disruptive in the reconstructive market. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Co. Your line is now open. Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start with MAKO and thinking through the total knee full launch next year. I guess to what degree do you think the need to sell the very expensive capital equipment or the robots will limit the growth or limit the rate at which you can take market share in the knee market? And is there anything you can do to potentially speed up those placements in order to capture more of that knee implant share? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, so we're selling the $1 million robots right now. We did 17 this quarter, and that's before we've gone into full commercial launch for what we think is the biggest driver in value with the MAKO opportunity. And moreover, we've been selling very expensive capital in our MedSurg businesses for literally years and years. So we understand how to sell capital. It is fundamentally different than selling implants or disposable, which is why we have a separate dedicated salesforce. We also have for a number of years now had a flex financial group within the Stryker organization, and our MAKO group is using that to leverage their expertise to offer different options to our customers whether they want to buy outright or lease. And so that expertise that's been developed for a number of years through MedSurg is clearly enabling a different type of discussion with customers than was possible when MAKO was a standalone. So we feel really comfortable in our ability to sell capital and the value proposition that's driven by the different applications that will exist on the MAKO robot. Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: I guess what I was getting at is, if you came out with a new type of a knee implant, you could walk into an operating room and the doctor could switch to that new implant on day one, whereas if they're going to switch to MAKO, they've got to convince the hospital to buy a really expensive robot first. So that's going to kind of slow down the ability to take knee market share, is it not? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, to be able to do a robotic knee, you have to buy the robot and it will be a closed system and can only use our knee. So that's part of the value proposition. We go in and we have that discussion and articulate the benefits here. So this is very different than just simply coming out with a new knee and not having to buy capital. Yes, that's correct. But it's also very different in terms of the value that we think we'll bring forward and will start to get evidence of as we do these observational studies and look at benefits around less tissue disruption, improved alignment, a number of different factors that we think will help support the value proposition. Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: All right, thanks. And just if international growth were to improve, what would that do to your gross margin? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Generally international flows through gross margin at roughly the same rate that we're experience on an average here. It would roughly flow through at about the 67%. It really depends sort of where internationally, as well too, because certain emerging markets are better. European pricing impacts are usually higher. But up and down from the 67%, that's roughly a good ballpark estimate. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. Your line is now open. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One spine question and then one on the medical business. First, I mean, what are you seeing sort of in the spine market broadly from a competitive perspective? And really I'm curious about your thoughts on sort of that multiyear robotic movement that now several companies are talking about in that space specifically. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we really like that many companies are talking more and more about robotics. I think that provides a real good tailwind for MAKO. We believe we have certainly the best system with haptics and really terrific intellectual property. And so the more that robotics become a positive word out in the medical technology community with our customers, I think that provides a real good tailwind for us on MAKO. We're not seeing anything new in the spine market. It's a tough market with many competitors. We like our ability to win in the market based on the innovations that we've been bringing forward over the last two, three years. We did have our own challenges, as we've mentioned a couple of times on the call related to supply disruption, but nothing really new from a competitive standpoint. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the recent acquisitions in the medical business. I mean, just looking at the pro forma growth rates you gave us in the quarter, understanding we're obviously early in the integration process, but with that in mind, I mean how do you expect those pro forma growth rates to trend in the coming quarters? I mean should we expect modest dislocation before an acceleration or just consistent growth with typical seasonality in Q3 and Q4? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I'd say, I guess my answer would be consistent growth in Q3 and 4 tied to that, those numbers we cited of high single digits and double digits. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First, international. Kevin, I think you said last quarter emerging markets were down in the high single digits in the first quarter. Was it similar in Q2? And by our math, Europe was also a little soft in Q1. How was Europe in Q2 and what's the outlook there? And I did have one follow-up. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I'd say emerging markets, it was a very similar story in Q2 as it was in Q1. It was just as bad a quarter. As it relates to Europe, Europe had a mid single digit growth in the second quarter, so we were actually very pleased with the second quarter performance. There was a little bit of softness in the first quarter and it got back on track in the second quarter. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then for Tim on the ischemic stroke market, could you talk a little bit about how that market has been developing in 2016 versus a strong 2015? In terms of patient numbers treated in the US, it was probably up 30%, 40% from about 12,000 to 16,000, 17,000 last year. Is 2016 looking like as strong a year just from a ischemic treatment, endovascular treatment of ischemic stroke? Thanks a lot. Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology: Yeah, I think the growth trends have been similar this year to last year. And certainly further to this law of larger numbers and what have you, the growth rates arguably would diminish with time. But it continues to be a very robust market with very significant growth opportunities lying ahead of us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, just to follow-up on the robotics question and the competitive landscape. Just specifically with respect to spine, can you talk to us a little bit about what your view is of spine robotics technologies in light of recent investments that others are making there? And then I'm more just thinking if and when you potentially adapt a MAKO solution to spine, what area or in what capacity do you think that could add value to the procedure? Then I have a follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, I think it's just early right now. There's been a lot announced, but there hasn't been a whole lot launched. And so I think we're just going to have to wait and see, and do they truly facilitate making the procedure easier or enhancing the outcomes. We do believe there's opportunity for robotics when we look at MAKO in spine, but it is not the focus right now. We are completely focused on the opportunity in recon, and particularly gearing up for the total knee launch. So it's certainly something that we're going to evaluate, but near term it is not the focus. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a second one, someone asked a question earlier about Medtronic getting into hips and knees eventually. I guess my question to you is Medtronic talked about a risk-sharing model. Can you talk a little bit about what, if anything, Stryker is thinking about doing and potentially going at risk with the hospital in an episode-of-care payment situation? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, we have done that. We've had our Stryker Performance Solution group within the company now for a number of years. They go at risk. We've got convener status. Under the prior program, we're able to share with customers. So this is something that through that SPS, we've got a lot of institutional knowledge. We obviously have a very deep understanding around the reconstructive procedure, what the value drivers are through the entire episode of care, both in the acute and the post-acute setting. So given our long history in ortho, we think we're well positioned on top of the expertise we developed over recent years through our Stryker Performance Solution to really go in and partner with customers, and sometimes go at risk and at others construct models that help them maximize the value chain. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We just haven't talked about it a lot since it's not an enormous part of our business, but we have the capability. We're already doing it and we certainly are having more and more conversations with customers as the CJR rolls into effect. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on, Kevin, your comments on Europe and stronger growth in Q2 from Q1. And I think this is the second quarter post annualization of the Transatlantic Model Initiative. Are you beginning to see more benefits in Q2? And do you think we should, should we think about your European business continuing to potentially accelerate or at least continue to get, receive benefits from this Transatlantic model? I just wanted to see if there was an update there. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. So first, rather than just focus on the first quarter, I think we had a very successful year last year in the first year of the Transatlantic model, but it wasn't across every business. And we still have a number of businesses that have good growth in front of them. I highlighted knees. I highlighted instruments, and even part of our endoscopy division still has significant growth. So to us, we look at Europe as being a growth market, just given our relatively lower market shares, and we see it as a growth market for the next several years. So regardless of what's going on with Brexit or anything else, our relative low market share creates a big opportunity and this model that we've implemented we feel is contributing to the growth that we're experiencing and will continue to deliver high growth or higher than we've experienced over the past decades in Europe. So it continues to be a growth market. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And I just had one follow-up on, with pricing, in the press release you called out a 1.3% headwind in Q2. And I was hoping to just get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the market. I know there's a lot of different sub-segments within your business, but I guess from a high level, how should we be thinking about the sustainability? Is this a new level? Is there anything to call out in the quarter? And just what you're seeing out in the market from a pricing standpoint. Thanks a lot. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, if you look in the \u2013 we break out the pricing and it tends to be more negative in Ortho versus MedSurg, but there's been no real change. Yes, it's trending slightly better or slightly less bad at 1.3% versus the 1.5% to 2% range that we forecast. But we've also seen quarters not too far back where it trended a little bit worse and came in north of 2%. So it's within tens of basis points at the range we're targeting. And there's so many variables between mix, both product as well as geographic that play in there that I wouldn't view this as indicative of some new trend line. I think 1.5% to 2% is a good number to focus on. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi, this is Lee Preston (59:38) on for Amit. I wanted to touch on two things from mix. It seems like some of your competitors' data for product mix has been pretty much ceased to be a positive tailwind. It's pretty much flat now. I know you guys used to talk about it in that kind of positive 2% range, and it was offsetting price headwinds at about the same level. I realize you might not want to throw out a specific number, but directionally are we still in the same ballpark with the product mix that we had been in the past several years, around that positive 2%? And what are your thoughts on sustainability of positive product mix going forward? This is for hips and knees specifically. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Okay. So when we report price, and I know some companies do it one way, some companies do it the other, we report pure price and then the other number is volume and mix together. So price is negative, pure price negative, in Ortho, and it is offset obviously by volumes and to a lesser degree by mix. There hasn't been a big change in that in recent years, in terms of the overall impact of those items. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then I have one follow-up. If you think about CJR next year, do you expect your mix of standard versus premium implants to change at all within your CJR customers for hips and knees? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I think it's early. We'll see what happens next year when they start to go into the penalty phase. Again, we really believe based on all our research that the focus there is going to be much more in the post-acute setting since 50% to 60% of the costs lie there for the total procedure, and there's tremendous opportunity to take cost out when you look at the post-acute setting and the number of patients who get discharged to a rehab facility versus home care. That's where we think the biggest focus is going to be, because that's where the biggest dollars are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes we can. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I was wondering if you could just comment reflecting on the first half, just on utilization more broadly. Are you seeing anything different in the US market, it would be a little bit stronger than you would expect? Or you guys are seeing good execution and product updates (61:48)? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah, there's been no real change in utilization. Obviously hip utilization was a little bit lower in the US in the second quarter, but no, there has been no overall change in underlying demand across the businesses. It does vary bit to bit. Obviously the demand is going to be greater in something like ischemic. But no, there's been no fundamental change. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And once you get through the drawdowns in China, what kind of growth do you expect for your businesses in that market? Or what visibility do you have on the end markets there? Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : I think we'll have a better sense once we get through that. We're focused right now on really getting to the appropriate inventory level, and getting a much better sense of end user demand, because there is this distributor layer there. So it's difficult to predict right now. The comps get easier in the second half, but beyond that, we just don't have the visibility to say what true end market demand is going to be. As we start to get better visibility into the channel, we'll be able share that with you, but it would be premature to throw a number out. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the area that's sort of the most hard to predict is capital equipment. I think on the disposables and the implants side of the business, we see that sort of, that's still, those markets are actually still fairly healthy and we expect that to continue going forward. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is now open. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks for squeezing us in. So I had one follow-up on orthopedic growth from Q1 to Q2. And I guess when we do the math on J&J's numbers, let's let you look at knees in the US, and adjust for selling days, adjust for price, it was a deceleration from Q1 to Q2. And you clearly, A, you've accelerated and B, you're also just growing at a higher rate. But I'm curious, is that feel in the marketplace to you like share gains in terms of accounts or mind share somehow? Or do you get the sense at all that there was, you know what the overall market was like? I know this is an (63:54). Just love to get what your perspective is on their deceleration and your sort of call it modest acceleration after adjusting for days. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so this is really our fourth really good performance in these, fourth quarter in a row of really strong performance. And we tend to attribute that much more to the launch of our cementless cones and the cementless knee business are really picking up. So our 3D printed products. We really believe that that's a big part of this and we also get a bit of a MAKO halo impact. So not specifically just the volume that's coming from our unis, but also wherever we put MAKOs, we tend to drive a higher mix of our business. So rather than comment on one particular competitor, I would just point out that our business has really picked up, and it's been multiple quarters now in a row of strong performance, really linked I believe to new products and the halo impact of MAKO. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could. And I have a feeling the answer is going to be it's early around bundled payments. But speaking to folks in the field and working at some of these hospitals, either through BPCI or starting to consider how to tackle CJR, there is some thinking that there are centers that are just going to look at this and say we don't do enough of these procedures maybe to keep doing hips and knees, and maybe start shifting those procedures elsewhere in the network or upstream somehow. Again, I know it's early, but could you give some perspective on how you think that may play out in the market, because it's so much of the volume in orthopedics in the US is done by sort of lower volume centers. Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations : Yeah. It is early, so it's an accurate comment. Could we see in some hospitals a shift? It's possible. But I think it's too early to say that that's going to be a discernible enough trend or how it impacts the volumes of hospitals where it shifts to, to make any big comments on it. I'm sorry. We just don't have more insights yet given the early stage combined with the fact that there's no penalty in the first year. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the third quarter 2016 results will be held on October 27. Also, our analysts meeting and product fair will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in Mahwah, New Jersey. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Operator : Welcome to the third quarter 2016 Stryker earnings call. My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator for today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during his conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's Current Report on form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO and our November analyst meeting. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A. We achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, coming in at 6.2% and fueled by a strong showing for both MedSurg and Neurotechnology with both delivering roughly 7% increases. Orthopaedics growth was consistent at approximately 5% organically. On a geographic basis, Q3 sales were balanced with a 6% increase in the U.S. and a 6.7% gain in International, driven by strong momentum in Europe and a return to growth in emerging markets. We are pleased with the performance of our acquisitions, including both Sage and Physio-Control, which are well positioned to help us drive stronger organic sales growth for Stryker in the coming years. The strong top-line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on G&A leverage, resulted in EPS of $1.39, up 11.2% and a penny above the high end of our targeted range. Based on our performance for the first nine months of 2016, we are confident in our ability to deliver our commitments with organic sales growth for the full year expected at 6% to 6.5%. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to the upper end, which now stands at $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Overall, we believe the strength of our people, diversified revenue model, and new product flow positions us well to continue to deliver sales at the high end of med tech with leveraged earnings gains. We look forward to providing our 2017 financial guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will include an update on MAKO, as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting. Starting with MAKO, results in the quarter were strong, with a total of 30 robots installed globally, representing a roughly 75% year-over-year increase with 23 in the U.S. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately 40% of the installations were in competitive accounts which Stryker has no or relatively low market share. Demand for the MAKO robot is being fueled by the expanded indications, including the Total Knee which began a limited launch in June. Since that time, we have had KOL surgeon surgeons trained on the robot for the Total Knee, including those with prior robot experience but with less exposure to our triathlon knee, as well as surgeons who had not previously used a robot for joint reconstruction. As we discussed previously, by observing both these groups we are optimizing the training protocol. Of note, since the start of the limited market release for the Total Knee over 200 cases have been performed and we've been pleased with the results to date. We are targeting the 2017 AAOF meeting to move into the full commercial launch. I will now shift to the analyst meeting which will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in New Jersey. In order to optimize the utility of this meeting we will be focusing the formal part of the meeting on several key areas. This will include a MAKO Physician panel with two surgeons who have been part of the limited market release. We will also have a Stryker Performance Solutions panel, which will include an SPS customer and focus on how we've been able to deploy our expertise in the joint reconstruction episode of care to help reduce their procedural costs. Turning to cost transformation for growth, Lonny Carpenter, Group President of Global Quality and Operations will provide an update on the various initiatives within CTG, including the expected financial contribution over the next few years. Glenn Boehnlein will provide a financial update, including our longer term targets. We will conclude the formal part of the meeting with a Q&A session with the leadership team. We will then move to the product fair, which will include product highlights for MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and will forward the opportunity to interact informally with the broader Stryker leadership team. We hope you will be able to join us for the meeting. The event details and complete agenda, including the various guest speakers and their backgrounds are available on the event registration site. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, which was within our range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5% with no difference in selling days. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a nominal impact on sales. U.S. sales continued to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6% reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg and Neurotech. International sales grew 6.7% organically, highlighted by solid gains in Europe, Canada and Australia, somewhat offset by the continued impact of our previously discussed destocking issues in China. We expect that the fourth quarter will show some improvement in our China business as prior year comparables continue to ease. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03, related to transactional foreign currency exchange. Focusing on our segment highlights, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.3% and organic growth of 4.8%, led by the U.S. organic growth of 4.7%. These gains reflect solid performances in Trauma and Extremities at 6.9% and Knees at 5.1%. This growth reflects strong demand for our 3D printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, and our MAKO platform, which had 30 units installed including seven outside the U.S. Orthopaedics International delivered constant currency growth of 6.3% and organic growth of 5.1%, led by our European business. MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter, with constant currency growth of 33% and organic gains of 7.3%, which included a 7.7% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which was up 5.2% in the U.S., maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3 and continued strong performance related to its navigation business. Endoscopy delivered U.S. growth of 10.4%, driven by strong double-digit performances of its camera and light source products, and strong gains in its Communications, Sports Medicine, and ProCare service businesses. Our Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.8%, driven by double digit growth of its core bed and power cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical's Physio business was up 6.3%. It's Sage business grew 12.5%, including the impact of the recent recall. Excluding this, Sage grew 15%. We are pleased with these results and the ongoing integration efforts at Medical. Internationally, MedSurg organic sales growth was 6%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparable in China. Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive above market performance with constant currency growth of 8.7% and organic growth of 6.9%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 9.1% in the quarter, highlighted by our AIS products and our neuro powered instruments. Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our 3D printed interbody Tritanium products. As I said last quarter, we expect the supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, Neurotech had constant currency growth of 16.7%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Trevo stent retriever and Target coil products in Europe and Asia. Spine's International growth was 1.6%, and was impacted by the aforementioned supply issues and challenges in China. Now I will focus on the operating highlights within the quarter. Our gross margin, which on an adjusted basis was 66.3%, was down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was offset by mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange. SG&A for the third quarter was 34.9% of sales on an adjusted basis, which was favorable by 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions. We continue to invest in internal innovation with R&D, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year to 6.5% of sales. In total, adjusted operating expenses at 41.4% of sales was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year quarter and these results continue to reflect our focus on leveraged growth. In summary, our operating margin was 24.9% of sales in Q3, flat year-over-year, but up 64 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control, and favorable accretion from acquisitions offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange. Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to the higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. During the third quarter, we also paid down $750 million of debt and, accounting for the impact of this, we anticipate our future quarterly run rate of interest expense to be approximately $65 million. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.5% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S. based income from our recent acquisitions. Moving onto the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $6.8 billion. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016. In terms of guidance, we reconfirm our previous full year organic sales growth range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect a neutral impact in the fourth quarter and a negative foreign currency impact of less than 0.5% for the full year. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80 for the full year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch : Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Hi, Bob. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Hi, Bob. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Hi, Bob. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really solid quarter all around. So I have two questions. One, I'll start with you, Kevin. I was encouraged to hear your comments about emerging markets and turning back to the positive there. So maybe you could just kind of lay out specifically what improved and what you think the prospects are for your emerging growth now that you've kind the turned a corner can we get back to mid to high single digits in a reasonable timeframe for emerging markets? Just wanted to hear more color on EM. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, sure. So, outside of China, I would say I'm really encouraged by the progress in India, which is really a continuation of what we've been experiencing in the past few quarters. Brazil returned to growth, and as you know, Brazil has been a very challenging market for us over the past year to two. We also had good results in Russia, Turkey, so it's really across the board. Our other emerging market countries performed very well. China is still a bit of a laggard, but as Glenn mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect China to return to growth in the fourth quarter. So we're starting to see an improvement. Part of this is really the comparables and we're sort of lapping the years of sort of poor performance. So, we would expect a bit of a turnaround, but it's really early. It's only one quarter, but I'm starting to see a trend that we will see growth. Now whether it will get back to double digit, as we experienced in prior years, is a little early for me to say, but certainly the outlook is much more positive than it has been over the past year. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill lynch : Okay, thank you. And then for Katherine, as a follow-up, just on your comments on the Analyst Day and MAKO. On the Analyst Day, I know you're not giving guidance until the fourth quarter, but what will you be quantifying at the Analyst Day in some of these prepared commentary? Will there be any quantification of cost savings or long-term margin opportunities? Just want to make sure I have a good understanding of exactly what we're going to get at the Analyst Day? Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. In addition to the panels that focus on MAKO and SPS, Lonny will be giving a CTG update which will include a greater quantification and visibility around the long-term potential from the cost savings that we're targeting. And then, Glenn will be giving an update with some of our longer term financial targets. We'll go into the full detail of that at the Analyst Day but also to be clear we won't be giving 2017 guidance ranges, the formalization of our targets, until the January fourth quarter call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you. Maybe I'll also start with MAKO. You obviously had an exceptionally strong quarter. Maybe, Kevin, or Katherine, you could give us a little more color there. Maybe just sort of multi-part question on this. What kind of pull through are you seeing for Stryker products, particularly in competitive accounts? And maybe talk a little more, if you could, about some of the clinical data surrounding MAKO we might see. I know that's been a priority for this year. What might we see and when will we see it? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think obviously the 30 robots placed we're very pleased with that number of installations. We're also pleased that they are going into roughly 40% into competitive accounts. It's also what is helping drive our knee growth, which we believe is above market. I mean, clearly it's a big focus for our sales force right now given their excitement around that. We do believe qualitatively we're going to get \u2013 continue to receive feedback around benefits including alignment, less tissue disruption, and ultimately patient satisfaction. Longer term clinical data on that is going to take time to collect. We will be garnering that but that's going to be one, two, three year data and obviously it will take that long. I think it will be a great opportunity at the panel at the Analyst Day where we're going to have a surgeon who had no experience with the robot to prior becoming part of the limited market release of the knee, as well as a longer term robot user to ask those questions and hear what their experience has been. But with the 200 cases to date we've been really pleased what we've seen so far and the ability to both get into competitive account and optimize the training protocol ahead of full commercial launch, which as we said will take place in March at the Academy Meeting. Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just to follow-up on Sage and Physio briefly. Maybe just highlight. I know we'll hear more soon, where are we in terms of integration and costs and sales? Kevin, do you feel like you're on plan? Sage grew a little faster than the second quarter, Physio a tad slower. I assume that's seasonal, but again, any more color there would be welcome. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Rick. First of all, over the full six-month period we're really pleased with both companies performance. They're really in line with our expectations. The integrations are going very well. As you know, Sage is what I'll call a lighter integration, given that there's less of an overlap with the call point, but certainly we're sharing leads with the Sage organization. And Physio, we have a little bit more of call point overlap. It's really more of a planning phase this year. The sales forces are running independently this year and then over the course of the next year or two we'll start to integrate those sales forces. But I would say so far so good on integration, and we're pleased with the performance and really the outlook for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan your line is open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, and congratulations on getting back above that 6% bar. It's nice to see. Katherine, the September healthcare conferences proved a bit trickier this year, and there was a bunch of questions that seemed to have come out of them, where people were asking about comments that you guys had made. So maybe I thought this would be a good opportunity to clarify a couple of them. And Katherine, Kevin, chime in here, two sets of comments were, Kevin, just about your outlook for the Trauma business and the Hip businesses and some potential deceleration in growth. And then, naturally, people try to get you to comment on 2017 preliminarily and how to think about operating and financial leverage, excluding the impact of the acquisitions, and there seem to be some confusion around that. So, maybe just want to spend a minute on both the outlook for the Trauma and then the Hip business in light of all the focus on the Knee side and then just comment, if you would, about how we should think about operating leverage heading into 2017 without obviously giving guidance? Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure, Mike. I'll take the Trauma and Hip question and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about I think some misperceptions around 2017. So what I've been saying for some time on the Trauma business is that sustaining 15% growth quarter-after-quarter is pretty unlikely. We've done that for over three years coming into this year. If you look at last year's third quarter, we grew 15.1% in the U.S. And so to put up a 7% growth against that comp is still pretty solid performance, but law of big numbers is we've been signaling that trauma will start to slow down a little bit in terms of its growth rate, but certainly performing above market. And I think still a solid strong performance this quarter. But the only signal there is that sustaining that level of above performance, three times the market, is not likely to do indefinitely. So no concerns. We have a very strong trauma leadership team, strong business, strong pipeline, and I'm still very bullish about that division. As it relates to Hips, we're longer in our product cycle, with Accolade II being one of the newer products that we launched a few years ago and a lot of excitement in Knee. And as you know, the same sales force that sells both Hips and Knees. We have a big launch upcoming with MAKO Total Knee. We have a lot of cementless products in the knee portfolio. So, I would say that there's been a bit of a tension focused on knees, and we've seen this in our industry for decades that it is very difficult to be able to focus on both products equally. So the fact that our Hip growth, which had been above market for above three or four years, is now moving let's say more in line with market is not also surprising. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: And just going back to some of the misperceptions around some of the conferences, the healthcare conferences in September, I would tell you candidly we were surprised as anybody that there was any misperception. We've tried to be very consistent in terms of our goal of growing sales at the high end of med tech. We think the med tech markets are largely stable, at least the segment where our product portfolio competes. And as Kevin said in his prepared comments at the start of this call, we feel really good about our ability to continue to deliver that. The specific range around that, which may have been where some of the misperceptions came, we will talk about in January. As we do every year. So to the degree of unwillingness to give guidance ahead of when we normally do it caused some concern. I think that was incorrect. We feel great about the momentum and the product portfolio and we'll look to specify that in terms of financial ranges in January. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. Katherine, just one follow-up if I can. The growth in MAKO this quarter in the units sold or placed, was that to \u2013 just to characterize it. Was that to the beta sites that have been doing the early launch feedback for you guys? Or is that the centers anticipating the launch? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: It's both. Some of those are part of the limited market release, but that's a small group. Some of those who are just, for a lack of a better way of putting it, getting in the queue because they want to be part of the upgrades and ready for the total launch. So it's a mix, but it is I would say that limited market release customers are the minority. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just two quick questions, one for Kevin, one for Katherine. Kevin, you have got a wide range of businesses now, so you're back up of 6% organic this quarter, and I agree with Mike that was nice to see. I wonder if you could just comment, given the broader environment this particular quarter, a couple of things. One, just your capital business is very strong. There's some emerging concern that the election cycle is going to result in some capital freeze or did result in that in the months of September and October heading into election cycle. So just the broader capital environment heading into election are you seeing any change in sort of relative backlogs? And then utilization, sort of a similar question. A lot of talk about polarization in sort of July, August versus September. I mean did you see a change in how utilization trended in some of your Orthopaedics businesses across the quarter? And then I will have a quick one for Katherine. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, so thanks, David. What I would tell you is that we haven't seen really any change in the capital business. It's been extremely stable. The election to us is really a nonevent, in terms of the businesses that we participate in. As you know, there's a lot of attention being drawn to pharma. A lot of comments we made about pharma but med tech is a very small percent of the overall healthcare spend and we're not seeing really any impact whatsoever. And as it relates to procedural volume, again, we didn't see anything unusual within the months of the quarter. Very, very stable market and that's not new. The market has been stable for the past two years, three years and we continue to perform well in this market. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Kevin. I won't ask you who you're voting for. Katherine, in terms of back half 2017, you'd said MAKO, it's unlikely we see share movement until back half 2017 at the earliest. I just think about it's the biggest year-on-year system add you've had, I think, since you bought the company. You've got 40% competitive accounts and obviously you're going to have a bigger launch at AAOS. Is the back half of 2017 still the earliest that we could start to see share movement in the knee channel? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think that's the way to be thinking about it right now. Remember, these robots have to get installed. That takes time and energy and people. We have to train, and so there's a cadence. This is not like an easy product that you launch overnight and it runs. So, we need to be thoughtful in that. We're very pleased that we can target Academy for the full commercial launch and we'll be well prepared to go and train from there, but I still think the back half of the year is the best time to be focused on in terms of starting to see indications that we're gaining meaningful new market share. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Just to go back, I guess, to some of the comments on the acquisitions. I know you said that integration's going so far. Would you be willing to say, in terms of the 2017 accretion numbers that those still look to be intact, based upon how the businesses are performing? Better or worse than you had originally stated? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, hi, Kristen, it's Glenn. Yeah, we actually were on track in 2016 to hit the accretion numbers that we put out there. And then also for 2017, based on our preliminary planning, we think we'll be on track to hit the numbers that we put out for accretion as well. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then has FX changed at all in terms of the bottom line impact? And with the change in stock option accounting, can you give us a sense in terms of how that may also impact or maybe what the impact might be in 2016 or 2015 or anything to that extent you could help frame? Thanks very much. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, yeah. It feels like two questions, and I'll take a stab at them both. So, first off on FX, as you can see, translational is easing, especially in Q3. And we expect it to be nominal in Q4. Transactional will still continue to impact us as it did this quarter, and it will next quarter. And part of that is related to our hedging program and the way we lock in hedges 18 months ahead of time and how that relates to the current exchange rates that are out there. And then secondly, as it relates to the change in stock options, I think if you take a look, we've disclosed what we think that will be, which is roughly maybe $30 million and we don't plan on adopting it until next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, congrats on the quarter, guys. Kevin, it's been a little while since you guys hosted an analyst meeting, and I know you talked about not wanting to comment too much on forward guidance yet, but you're going to have the chance to talk about some of the progress you've made with some of the investments to get at cost in the middle of the income statement, in particular. I see Lonny is on the agenda. Can you talk a little bit about some of those programs? You've highlighted the ERP transition, some of the other things you're doing, and will this be an opportunity to sort of layout the next steps at how we get at some leverage, particularly in the middle of the income statement going forward? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Hey Chris. I think what you'll hear Lonny talk about is progress on multiple fronts, as we've gotten the CTG program underway, ERP is one of them, product lifecycle management, plant optimization, indirect spend. And as we try to articulate, giving greater quantification around the longer term targets and expected contribution from that. So that will be the focus of his comments while Glenn will focus on our longer term financial targets beyond 2017. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, that's helpful. And then, sorry if I missed this earlier, I've been jumping around, but can you talk a little bit about the trauma and extremities business? Good quarter there. A little bit of a pickup from what we saw last quarter. Anything in particular driving that? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: No, I would say it's just continued strong performance. We've been performing very well in our trauma business over the last three years and it was just more of the same this quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaila Krum from William Blair. Your line is open. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for me. So in terms of acquisition strategy, and I guess specific to Orthopaedics and Spine, are you guys more focused on scale or gross at this point? And granted, they do come hand-in-hand, but one tends to lead to the other, so just trying to better understand your M&A strategy there. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: There's no change in M&A strategy, whether it's the company overall or Ortho versus MedSurg or Neurotech, it's focused on our core in key adjacent markets. If you look historically, the bulk of our deals have been in core markets with a few key adjacent acquisitions, and that will continue to be the strategy going forward across all the divisions. So no change from that. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Extremities business. I mean, just looking specifically at foot and ankle, can you guys talk about how your foot and ankle performance has been recently? Is it still sort of trending at historical levels? And just any commentary on market trends there would be helpful. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, so we're really pleased with our foot and ankle performance in the U.S. this quarter. We grew 15%, very much in line with the performance we've had over the past year. It continues to be a very good market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thanks, guys. Two questions. First, pricing in Orthopaedics down 2.2%. That was similar to the second quarter. So, I'm wondering if the new trend line for Orthopaedics pricing is now going to be in that 2% to 2.5% range. And then I had another follow-up on pricing. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think we feel comfortable from a total company perspective their pricing is going to be down in that 1.5%, 2% vicinity. It's been trending slightly less negative. Ortho, it seems relatively stable, but candidly, trying to predict that level of accuracy 50, 100 basis points moves in prices is really difficult. We have greater confidence and visibility when you look at the totality of the company because we have areas with less pricing pressure. And so we really try to focus on the total versus a specific line item where it can move around quarter-to-quarter. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And just as a follow-up to that. Pricing, again I look at it sequentially pretty stable, and now we're in the six months of CJR, so it seems like there's no impact to pricing. So, I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on the implementation of CJR and are you seeing any pricing pressures? Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, we would agree that we really haven't seen an impact, but in fairness too, it has only been six months. And in the first year there is no financial penalty, so we really believe you are going to see a greater focus by hospitals when there's more of a financial incentive as you go into 2017. I think you'll be able to get a lot better visibility, or hopefully well, at the Analyst Day because we will have a hospital customer who has experience under the bundled payment, but we continue to believe their focus is going to be in the post-acute setting on rehab costs, since there is tremendous value to be realized by shifting more patients to the home and out of some of the skilled nursing facilities and other rehab facilities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is open. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So I had one kind of topical question coming out of NASS and your demonstration of Tritanium and your 3D printed products. And I had one follow-up just on the Ortho side, if I could. So, one of the things you talked about in your presentation and the Q&A afterwards there was just the build out you put in place around 3D printed products, in general. Of course, that drives the Spine portfolio of really one key product at the moment, but also your press-fit knee, cementless knee tibia platform you've talked a lot about. So, I'm wondering, as you build that out, just given the proportion of your business, given the performance of your business, how are you prioritizing, I guess, are you getting leverage across those two platforms in the way you manufacture and how you're sort of thinking about which one of these sort of high-demand products gets the volume over time. And I have one more follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Sure, Matt. The short answer is they all do. But we have been capacity constrained. We are adding 3D printing capacity on a monthly basis. We broke ground on a dedicated 3D printing facility in Ireland last year. . As you know, this is extremely highly technical with a great deal of know-how around 3D printing these type of metals. We will be launching additional 3D printed products, but you should assume you'll see the benefit of that in Spine as well as on our revision and press-fit knee portfolio. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Okay and then the follow-up just on the trends in Orthopaedics. The Knee number, in the U.S. in particular, I thought was quite strong going up against a pretty significantly tougher comp. Hips kind of the same. So, just in terms of trends there, I think we talked about back in September, what should we expect in terms of recovery in Hips or annualizing some of the launches that you've had in hips? And then on Knees if you could, is it the press-fit that's really making up the difference in driving \u2013 are we getting a mixed benefit, penetration benefit on the Knee side that's driving that strength? I appreciate it. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So keep in mind, it's the same sales force and the customer base on Hips and Knees. Accolade, which has been a terrific product launch for us, is several years into that now, whereas MAKO is getting enormous amount of focus and is a huge product launch, and as a result the sales force has focused on that. So there is a halo effect that's helping our Knee business. We also have additional new products on the Knee side, our 3D printed revision cones and sleeves and as we just mentioned our 3D printed cementless Knee, which is really driving us to now low double-digit penetration for cementless knees, which is well above the industry. So I think right now you're just in a period where there's a lot happening on the knee side, and a lot will continue to happen as we go into full commercial launch. We will be introducing more Hip products but sales force likes to focus on what is new and hot, and clearly a lot of that momentum right now is on the knee side. We think Hips probably more like overall market growth. Knees we believe we're going to continue to grow above the market. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: But certainly when you look at the overall we're very pleased with our performance. Our sales teams are doing a really excellent job and we're excited about the future years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Co. Your line is open. Mike Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. We've seen a real pickup in the amount of M&A in the Spine space and, Kevin, last I heard I think you were saying that you were happy with the performance of the Spine business and the turnaround there, and you didn't really feel the need to do something from an acquisition standpoint in Spine. But I just wanted to check in and see if that was still how you felt? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, as you look at our Spine business you see that we've had issues around product performances, supply chain disruptions, but we have a great leadership team and we had a number of quarters of very strong growth, and I believe in this leadership team and Tritanium is a great example of the 3D printed interbody device, which is performing very well. I'm confident our team can continue to perform well and grow the business. Relating to M&A, I will give you at same comment I gave for all of our divisions, we're always looking to strengthen our businesses, but we're not going to comment on whether we're going to do acquisitions big or small on any of our divisions. Mike Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Understand. And then you do have a significant portion of your cash outside the U.S. I know there's some talk of a potential tax deal after the election. So if that were to occur, obviously it would depend on the terms of that, but would you repatriate any of that cash and if you did how would you prioritize the use of that cash? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: You know, as we look at our cash, I'm sure we're in the same position as several other U.S. companies, and if something like that became available, as it did a few years back, we would definitely take advantage of it and repatriate our cash to the extent possible. In terms of how we might prioritize that cash, it's hard to say at this point. You know, we've said before about what our priorities are around capital allocation and that would mean M&A, that would mean dividends, and it may mean share buybacks. But commenting beyond that -- I don't think I can do that at this point of time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. Your line is open. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I have a couple for you. Firstly, I'm fascinated by this 40% placement of MAKO at competitive accounts. One of the big issues with Orthopaedics is that there's tremendous brand standardization on the part of surgeons as well as institutions for Hips or Knees. So how do you accomplish that where you put a robot in and get people to go beyond unis and kind of standardized on knees with the Stryker brand that they may not use most of the time today? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: The way we look at our MAKO adoption is really around behavioral segmentation \u2013 which surgeons like new technology and believe that they can become better in delivering value to their patients with technology. And so it's not about whether they like Stryker or whether they like Zimmer or whether they like J&J. it's about do they like robotics and do they believe in robotics. And that's why not surprising that many of the placements are in competitive shops. We're getting a little feedback. Can you hear me, Bruce? Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes, I can. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: I'm sorry, we're getting a little feedback in the room. So what I can tell you on this front is that's really all about the surgeon who wants to become better and who believes in technology. Less so about our specific relationships or whether the hospital is with Stryker or a different account. It's a different niche that we're serving. If you look at MAKO prior to our acquisition, they were able to obtain about 18% of the uni market over a four year period. They were not a proven entity. They weren't even an orthopaedic company. So we really believe this is about technology adoption, certainly in the first couple of years. It's really around behavior, which surgeons believe in technology, and we're going to go to the surgeons that believe in it. There are many skeptics, as you know, with all disruptive technology and some of those skeptics are Stryker loyal surgeons, and they won't be the first to adopt and that doesn't concern us because there are many surgeons who are interested and who will be willing to adopt. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And my second question \u2013 thank you for that \u2013 is as we were re-launching on Stryker, what really struck me was that, despite the acquisitive nature of the company, ROIC has been maintained and it seems to be like a core strength of the company. Could you talk about how that influences the profile of what you buy? How it fits in? And is that a formula you can maintain going forward? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: It's long been our history to be very disciplined in our deployment of capital. So when we look at deals we want to strengthen every division that we have in the company, but we won't just pay whatever for companies. We're very disciplined, we walk away when the prices are above our ability to deliver value and sometimes there's assets that we like and the price point's just too high, and we have discipline to walk away from deals. And I think that's why you see the ROIC so consistent year-over-year-over-year in spite of the acquisition nature. Also the ability to have acquisitions that fit in our existing business, that plug into our sales force, which is the bulk of the deals we do. We have a proven model to deliver value with those types of acquisitions. So I think it's a combination of playing to our strengths, in terms of our commercial execution, and being financially disciplined with the deals that we do make. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I want to maybe for you, Kevin, to start off where at NASS obviously, it's topical. We're seeing a lot of robotics take a bigger presence on the floor. Being that you were the first major company to kind of really validate the robotics category, I would love to hear what your view is of the robotics kind of push in Spine we're starting to see and how MAKO potentially fits in over the long run? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: We love the fact that robotics is taking up a lot of the discussion, because as you know with MAKO we believe in robotics. Right now at Stryker, our focus is on Hips and Knees, and specifically the Total Knee launch, but we see over time that certainly robotics will extend into other procedural areas, including Spine. We do have a small R&D effort underway right now but it's too early for us to speculate on when we would come to the market in that specialty. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thanks. And then maybe just one more follow-up. Outpatient surgery and the trend to outpatient and ambulatory surgery care; it's clearly where hospitals are trying to go. I'd love to just hear how you feel Stryker is positioned, either through technology or other means, to capitalize on that trend? And specifically if you could talk to whether or not MAKO is lending a hand in that effort? Thanks. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: We have a lot of experience with the ambulatory surgery center, with our sports medicine business, and as you know Spine \u2013 a number of procedures, the more simple procedures are starting to move into the ambulatory surgery center. At this stage, MAKO hasn't had a big impact, but we do see robotics is going to have a play in all of the different aspects of the care continuum. I think this trend will continue towards the shift of site of care, towards surgery centers will continue, but it's not something that we're unprepared for. We have plans across our divisions and as you saw if you were at NASS you saw the Spine division has actually created a program that's very specific for the surgery center. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to just (45:06)? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Larry, I apologize, we can't hear you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Are you on the speaker. Could you pick up please? Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hello, guys. Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, much better. Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Neurotech, that was a little slower in the U.S. this quarter. What drove the deceleration? And could you talk a little bit about how your ischemic stroke business is performing? I know you've talked about that as a key growth driver for you guys. Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So we continue to see good momentum in the AIS market. As we talked about before, predicting the slope and the speed of that market adoption is tricky, so it'll move around quarter-to-quarter. And AIS was a bit slower sequentially, although still healthy growth in that segment. We did have a coil recall in the quarter, which impacted our hemorrhagic business. That's fully resolved and shouldn't impact going forward. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. Hopefully you can hear me okay. Just wanted to start with MAKO and continue to focus on this a little bit more. But first of all, did you fully sell all 13 additional systems in this quarter versus Q3 of last year? And the reason I ask that question is, if you back that out, assuming you sold it all, it would seem like your core knee business was a little bit softer than one of your competitors reported this quarter. And then on a two-year stack basis, it's a little bit soft, as well. So, is there a risk as your sales force focuses on MAKO that we could see kind of the traditional knee business soften a little bit along with the Hip business, as well? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Well, we continue to sell all of our robots, just to be clear. And we report our robot sales in the other Orthopaedic category, which you can see is up quite a bit. The other items that are shown in that other category includes bone cement, and bone cement was down in the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally. We used to have a lot more stocking orders for bone cement and now our hospital customers are sort of buying it as they need it, and so bone cement does tend to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at our knee number, those are implants that you're seeing in the knee number and no robot sales. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Go it. Thanks for that clarification. And I'm also going off in memory on this one too, which is obviously scary, given the first question I just had. But it looks like, I think Physio grew about 9% pro forma last quarter and it grew about 6% this quarter. Obviously, we don't have the comparables to look at, but is there anything that's going on that's maybe slowing a little bit as you integrate that asset, or is it just more, \"hey, we had a tougher comp this time last year?\" Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I wouldn't read into that. Remember, it's a capital business. It tends to move around quarter-to-quarter. And so there wasn't anything unique relative Q2 to Q3. We're very pleased with that integration so far, recognizing as early as Kevin commented on. But you will see capital move around. And we tend to try and focus on multi-quarter rolling trends to really get a good sense with that business, but nothing to call out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Ian Mahmud in for Matt. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: We can. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: We can. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. So there's been a lot of discussion on Spine during this call, but I wanted to sort of explore it a little bit more and just ask about what you're seeing in terms of competition. I mean, we've heard a lot about redoubled efforts to focus on that area from some of your competitors, so just wanted to see if you're seeing anything different there and any commentary to highlight? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: There's nothing we would uniquely call out. It remains a highly competitive market with a lot of players across the board, both the larger, more established companies, and obviously the smaller ones. But there's nothing that we're seeing different with respect to any of the key competitors in the market at this time. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. All right. Thank you. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered. Glenn, maybe I missed it but could you talk about any of the drivers in gross margin between maybe price, currency or product or geographic mix? Just kind of big buckets, kind of what drove the change in gross margin this year \u2013 or this quarter? And then, as I think about some of the movements we've seen on the yen, on some emerging market currencies here recently, and given the 18-month hedging program. Just any very high-level comments you can make about how we think of just the currency hedge portion settling out in cost of goods, how that impacts over the next several quarters? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Sure. I think if you look quarter-to-quarter Q3 to Q4 our margin is fairly consistent. And I talked about this before, like you've mentioned there's lots of variables that impact our margin. Not only price, but FX, acquisitions, and certainly one of the biggest factors is mix. And the mix plays out in two ways. It plays out in sort of geographic mix, but also sort of business and product mix and so as I look year-over-year at third quarter, really probably the biggest impact that we had was related to business mix in terms of how much MedSurg versus Orthopaedics versus international we had last year versus this year. And then on the FX front, we entered the hedging program back when foreign currency was a lot more volatile and the whole idea was to lock in the predictability of foreign currency for us. So, like you had mentioned, currencies move up and down. Our hedging program provides stability and predictability to us. And so for the third quarter, I think as I said, there'll be sort of a nominal impact on sales related to translational, but that will have potentially a minor impact similar to this quarter related to transactional FX. And that's where I think we'll come out. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And over the next three/four quarters just will the currency side alone, and we can make our own assumptions then on everything else, but with currency should we be thinking of that as a small drag still for the next several quarters for gross margins? Is that a fair comment? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I don't know. I wish I had the currency crystal ball to figure out \u2013 how things were going to flow. But it's hard to say because it's not only impacted by, say, what we've done in hedging but what the underlying transactions are. So I don't think I can really comment that far out at this point. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2016 results will be held on January 24, 2017. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, all participants will have an opportunity to ask one question and one follow up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during the conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release, that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I will provide opening comments followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A. We achieved quarter\u2019s organic revenue growth of 6.7%, we delivered on our stated goal of achieving sales gains at the high-end of med tech. And despite tough year-over-year comparisons, Q4 represented our highest growth quarter, reflecting continued momentum throughout the year. Overall, it was another strong year for the company. We have shown remarkable consistency of top-line performance over the past four years. We continue to complete value creating acquisitions, our globalization efforts are bearing fruit, and we are also building capability to deliver consistent leveraged earnings. All of this is enabled by an outstanding team of high-performing leaders. Our sales growth was balanced across our three groups : orthopedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, once again underscoring the competitive strength of our diversified revenue model. On a geographic basis, the U.S. was up 6.3% organically while sales outside the U.S. posted a solid 7.7% increase, driven by another strong performance in Europe as well as year-over-year gains in emerging markets including China, which returned to growth due to soft comparisons. We would also note the performance of our acquisitions, particularly Sage and Physio, which posted adjusted growth in Q4 of 11.8% and 7.4% respectively. As a reminder, these two deals will begin to positively contribute to our organic growth in Q2 as they anniversary. With a strong top-line performance along with ongoing efforts around cost transformation for growth, adjusted per share earnings increased 14.1% to $1.78 a share, which represents the high-end of our $1.73 to $1.78 range. These results were achieved while maintaining a healthy investment in R&D to continue to drive future growth. As we look ahead to 2017, our sales and earnings targets reflect our continued commitment to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech and leveraged earnings. With the strength of our diversified model, our dedicated business units and sales teams coupled with our innovative product pipelines, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on these commitments. With that I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today\u2019s call will include an update on MAKO. We completed 2016 achieving continued success with MAKO as we installed a total of 32 robots globally of which 24 were in the U.S. For the full year MAKO installations totaled 86, an increase of 14 year-over-year, which brings a total number of robots globally to 381 with 333 in the U.S. During Q4, we expanded the limited market release to include additional sites, which will serve us training centers as we move towards full commercial release at the upcoming AAOS meeting. It\u2019s also important to note that in addition to installing new robots, during Q4 our MAKO capital specialists also begun upgrading existing robots, to enable the total knee application. This includes additional capital as well as software. Going forward our MAKO specialist will continue to focus on new robot installs as well as a multi-quarter process of upgrading existing robots. The revenue associated with the upgrade is included in other ortho revenue along with new robots, bone cement, and SPS related sales. Given the measured pace of the limited market release, we feel well-positioned to move into the full commercial launch, with a training protocol that will optimize outcomes for surgeons. We continue to focus on knee market share gains as the best barometer of the success of MAKO, and believe we will see evidence of its impact as we exit 2017. We look forward to the upcoming AAOS meeting, whereas you can imagine, MAKO will be the primary focus. We will host an investor event with members of our senior leadership team, along with a MAKO surgeon, to help answer your questions. We will also host a booth tour as we\u2019ve done in prior years, which will include a MAKO segment, along with other key new product launches. We hope you will be able to join us at the meeting. And with that I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Katherine. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and key performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.7% in the quarter with no difference in selling days. This was slightly above our full-year organic growth of 6.4%, which was at the high end of our latest outlook range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.5% from the prior year while foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable 0.6% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6.3%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg and Neurotech. International sales grew 7.7% organically highlighted by gains in Europe, Canada and Australia and as we expected, a return to growth in China as prior year comparables eased. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.78 increased 14.1% from the prior year reflecting strong sales growth accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our fourth quarter EPS was negatively impacted $0.03, by foreign currency exchange. Focusing on our segment highlights for the quarter, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%, led by the U.S. with organic growth of 5.9%. These gains reflect continuing momentum in U.S. Trauma and Extremities at 8.4% and Knees at 5.7%. Underlying this growth is strong demand for our 3D printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, and our MAKO platform, which installed an additional 32 units in the quarter including eight outside of the U.S. Orthopaedics International delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 3.9%, led by our European businesses. MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter, with constant currency growth of 32% and organic growth of 8.3%, which included a 7.4% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which grew U.S. sale 6% organically maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic growth of 5.9%, which underscores the strength of this product portfolio, including its video products, which includes the highly successful launch of the latest generation 1588 AIM camera generation platform, as well as communications, booms and lights products, and its sports medicine business. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 11.1%, driven by growth of its core bed, structure and power cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical\u2019s Physio business was up 7.4% and it\u2019s Sage business grew 11.8%. Both Sage and Physio continue to be accretive to Stryker, and our integration efforts are progressing as planned. In 2017, we continue to expect double-digit growth from Sage, and for Physio to be accretive to Stryker\u2019s growth rate. However, there will be pronounced seasonality with Physio, as they switch from a March 31 year end to Stryker\u2019s calendar year end, resulting in a soft first quarter, and stronger Q2 through Q4. Internationally MedSurg had constant currency growth of 29.4%, and organic sales growth rate of 11.4% which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparables in China. Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive above market performance with constant currency growth of 8.6% and organic growth of 6.7%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 11.4% in the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our neurovascular products, including our Target coils and AIS products, CMF products, and our neuro-powered instruments. Our spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our IVS and 3D printed interbody Tritanium products. We expect these supply issues to continue into the first quarter of 2017. Internationally, neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 11.6%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Spine\u2019s International growth was also impacted by the aforementioned supply issues. Now I will focus on the operating highlights in the forth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3%, was down 90 basis points from prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was more than offset by unfavorable mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange. Our adjusted SG&A of 32.6% of sales was a 110 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from our continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions. Meanwhile we continue to invest in internal innovation with Q4 R&D totaling 6% of sales and full year totaling 6.3%. In total, adjusted Q4 operating expenses were 38.6% of sales which was 110 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. These results continue to reflect our focus on leveraged growth. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 27.7% of sales up 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our full year operating margin was up 60 basis points from prior year. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control, and favorable accretion from acquisitions offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment of driving 30 to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin annually. Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due primarily to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter partially offset by the repayment of $750 million of debt in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S. based income from our recent acquisitions. Moving onto the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 84% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the year was $6.9 billion. Turning to cash flow, our full year cash from operations was approximately $1.8 billion. Finally, while we previously announced that we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016, we have lifted that suspension for 2017. We expect to repurchase approximately 250 million of shares, essentially, to offset the impact of dilution in 2017. And now I will provide our 2017 guidance. Based on our momentum from 2016, and our assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2017. There is one less selling day in 2017, as compared to 2016. As you update your quarterly models, please note that Q1 has one more selling day, both Q2 and Q3 have one less selling day, and Q4 has the same number of days. Additionally, you should expect to see the relative proportion of earnings by quarter in 2017 to be similar to what you saw in 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% in 2017. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2016. In addition, we expect our CTG program and other cost containment measures to add 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2017. As required, we plan to adopt the new accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. If our shares remain at the current levels and stock option exercises remain at historical levels, we expect the change in accounting for excess tax benefit to positively impact net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.7 to $0.9 in the full year, about half of which we expect in the first quarter. Including the impact of the aforementioned new guidance related to stock compensation, we expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate in 2017 will be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $450 million in 2017, as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure to support future growth. This level compares to $490 million of capital expenditures in 2016. Based on the current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect 2017 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 per share for the full year, and approximately $0.02 to $0.04 per share in the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign currency exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign currency exchange on earnings is mostly being offset by our hedging program, which we continue to layer in to our operations. Finally, for 2017 we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.45 for the full year, including approximately $1.40 to $1.45 in the first quarter. This guidance includes the aforementioned impact of FX, as well as accounting for stock compensation. And now I\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. You may proceed. Mike Weinstein : Thanks for taking the questions. Really, I think everything, as you\u2019ve laid it out in San Francisco, looks very consistent here. Kevin, just want to get your $0.02 on a couple of items. Number one, as you look at 2017, and you think about the potential for the MAKO momentum, benefiting at least your U.S. knee business and your capital sales and the orthopedic business, is there anything you see in 2017 that might not do as well? I would think the instruments business has a stronger year, and the spine business has the potential to recover. What\u2019s the offset that might keep you at the lower end of your 5.5% to 6.5% range? Obviously, we all see the potential for you to move to the higher end. Kevin Lobo : So thanks Mike. Obviously you\u2019ve seen the last two years we have grown organic sales greater than 6%. We exited the year with very good momentum across our portfolio, except for spine. So spine had a tough year this year, issues will continue into the first quarter. We expect spine to improve starting on the second quarter. We also have tough comparables. You\u2019ve seen the type of growth we had in the fourth quarter, we grew 6.7% on top of the 6.4%. So tough comparisons and the unknown, right. So things can happen in the marketplace that you don\u2019t anticipate. And so that\u2019s why, I think bracketing 6% shows consistency, and we feel very good across our businesses. As the year unfolds, we\u2019ll see. MAKO is something we\u2019ve never done before. It\u2019s a very big launch. We were the fastest-growing knee in 2016 without a big impact from MAKO, but there\u2019s a lot of unknowns as we do this launch. So I think it\u2019s prudent to put the range in that, we\u2019re certainly leaning into start the year with 5.5% to 6.5%. It certainly a stronger position than we\u2019ve had the last few years. Mike Weinstein : Just one follow-up, here. Are there any geographies in particular? You\u2019ve gotten through your tough comps, if you would, in China and Brazil. So, that obviously looks better going into 2017. Europe is coming off of a very strong 2016. Any geographies that you are concerned about, or you want to highlight? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think the macroeconomic uncertainty is the big in foreign currency right now. Obviously foreign currency doesn\u2019t impact our organic growth. But those are the two sort of things we worry about. Macroeconomics, there are elections that are going to be going on in Europe that could create uncertainty. Brazil seems to be getting, improving, but it\u2019s always so volatile. And China, we are not out of the woods, yet. Certainly, we have low comparisons, but we have a lot of work to do to improve our business in China. So I would say the areas of the world that concern us are the same that we\u2019ve had in the past, primarily related to emerging markets. And in Europe, there some macroeconomic uncertainty, with a number of elections happening in the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Kristen Stewart : Hi, I just wanted to go through the guidance and make sure I\u2019m understanding this. The $3.65, the $6.45 does include the change in stock compensation, correct, of $0.07 to $0.09? Kevin Lobo : Yes that\u2019s correct. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then how should we think about the incremental acquisition \u2013 accretion kind of falling through? Are you reinvesting all of that? Or, should we just think about the impact from the stock compensation is basically offsetting the larger headwind that you\u2019re expecting from FX this year? Kevin Lobo : Yes I think\u2026 Kristen Stewart : Or the benefit to reinvest the accretion from last year as you\u2019re talking about through 2016. Kevin Lobo : Yes, first off on the accretion we still maintain that that will drop through based on the guidance we provided of $0.15 to $0.30 [ph]. As far as FX, right now given where currencies are, for the most part offset by stock compensation. But, I can\u2019t necessarily forecast where that will fall out for the whole year. Will continue to provide transparent guidance relative to translational risk on FX. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. You may proceed. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thanks very much. Can you hear me, okay? Kevin Lobo : We can Bob. Bob Hopkins : Great. Good afternoon. So first question Kevin, is for you. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on the strength you are seeing in your growth rates outside the United States. I mean especially in hips and knees so maybe just some color on where is that coming from? Are you gaining share, is that market expansion? So just some color on the really strong U.S. growth we saw on fourth quarter. And then I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Sure. Thanks Bob. So we\u2019re really pleased with our performance in Europe this is the second year in a row that Europe is growing north of 6% and really very strong performance from our joint replacement business in Europe. Canada also had a very strong Q3, Q4. So as you know, we rolled Canada into our Transatlantic operating model at the beginning of 2016. And they had a very strong finish to the year. It took two quarters to sort of get Canada going but really had terrific performance and then I would say across the board we had good performance is in many of our regions. We have a significant MAKO presence already in Australia and we placed a number of machines outside the United States. And that\u2019s even if they are not yet doing total knees, it is a catalyst to provide growth. So really a strong performance but the countries that really stand out, I would say, would be Europe, for sure, where some recovery in China and Canada, as well those are the main markets. Bob Hopkins : Okay, great. And then for a follow-up, I want to ask you a question on kind of MAKO/capital spending environment. So on MAKO, if you could give us a little more color on maybe how that training is going? Any other metrics you are willing to share on training and how we should think about the rollout in 2017 in terms of placements? And then I was wondering, it\u2019s early, I realize. But are you seeing any signal at all from the market that hospitals might be more cautious in terms of spending on capital because of the political environment we are in and the risks around ACA? Are you seeing anything, at this point, on that front? Katherine Owen : Hey Bob, it\u2019s Katherine. I will take that question and I\u2019ll start with the second part and a short answer is no, we haven\u2019t seen anything related to ACA concerns. You saw really strong growth in our medical organic business on top of the acquisitions as the strongest Q4 business. So right now, there\u2019s no evidence that there has been any impact and we feel good about the capital environment as well as our momentum in that market, overall. In terms of MAKO, we do think we are really well positioned since we did take a very deliberate, limited launch to really get the training protocol optimize. And as you heard at our analyst meeting, we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far. We\u2019ve continued to expand the training sites. We\u2019ve got roughly 50 surgeons trained. And it\u2019s important that they\u2019ve done sufficient volume because they\u2019ll serve is the training centers as we go into the full commercial launch, which we continue to target at the Academy meeting. So we\u2019ll continue to report on installs going forward, we just also highlighted though, that they\u2019re also going to be upgrading some of the fleet that\u2019s already out in the field. But again, we feel really well positioned and think as we look towards exiting 2017 we will start to see a clear indication that the total knee application is helping us drive meaningful share gains. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis : Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones, here. Maybe starting with you, I mean the top line guidance was better than we expected by at least 50 basis points. And I think about the bottom line, your currency was pretty in line. You\u2019re obviously better on the top line and you obviously had a couple more pennies on stock comp than we thought. Are there any select investments I appreciate your bracketing consensus. But there any select investments you are choosing to make here in early 2017? Which is why maybe some of the top line benefits not dropping through or it\u2019s just a conservative tacked on currency, perhaps, kind of early on in the year? It looks like the bottom could be a little better to us based on that very strong top line. Kevin Lobo : Yes, David, I don\u2019t necessarily think there\u2019s anything that sort of warrants pointing out. I mean there are the obvious investments we talked about, especially our MAKO launch. But other than that, we are continuing to invest in our CTG program but that\u2019s really a continuation of things that we started last year and then we will continue to maintain sort of our kind of robust R&D spend as well, internally. David Lewis : Okay. And then be just two quick product questions, maybe one for Kevin and one for Katherine. Katherine just on MAKO, this quarter MAKO system numbers in line with our number, probably a little below the streets and its all tied to that, de novo placement versus upgrade dynamic. Does that play out throughout the balance of the year, Katherine as we get to the second half of the year should we start seeing a greater reliance on de novo system placements versus upgrades? And then for Kevin, just neurovascular, that business sort of slowed a little bit and sort of the latter half of this year, obviously on very, very strong comps. You sort of talk about the outlook for neurovascular 2017, 2018 any key product launches we should be focused on that business which has been kind of a key growth driver. Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yes, David in terms of the MAKO, you were going to continue to install new robots and as I mentioned we\u2019ve got a lot of robots out in the field, a significant portion of which we expect to upgrade to the total knee over a multi quarter period. Exactly how that plays out, you were only a quarter into upgrading, I think we are going to just have to wait and see how that plays out over the course of the year but it will be a mix, obviously, if new robot placements with the same capital salesforce, MAKO capital specialists also doing the upgrades. Kevin Lobo : Yes, as it relates to neurovascular, David, we still feel very bullish about the market you saw on Q3 both our results and the other major competitor, had a bit of a softer Q3 and then a nice bounce back in Q4. If you look at the full year, certainly in the U.S. our growth was 14.5% off a base of 15.6% the year before and so last year\u2019s fourth quarter was 16.7% this year\u2019s fourth quarter 12.8%, so you are talking about pretty good double-digit growth. There was one little blip and I think we are going to see that with the ischemic markets. So the ischemic market which is the very, very robust growing market. It\u2019s going to be a little choppy from quarter to quarter as new sites get established, new complete stroke centers get established. Getting that care pathway defined but we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects and I continue to expect double-digit growth we\u2019ve had since we\u2019ve acquired that business, every year, they had double-digit growth and we can expect that to continue in the future. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from UBS. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks for our question. So one follow-up on MAKO and then I had one kind of broader question for you, Kevin, if possible. And Katherine, to put \u2013 make sure we understand this process. It sounds like you\u2019re getting your training sites up to a level of volume where they\u2019re going to start doing more significant training. And that won\u2019t really happen until sort of the end of this quarter, just to put a finer point on it. Is that sort of when we expect training to really start kicking in? Katherine Owen : Yes. So when we say we go to full commercial launch at Academy that means we will have sufficient number of surgeons trained on sufficient volumes of procedures and located throughout various locations, geographically, that they can meet the demand for additional surgeon training going forward. That\u2019s exactly how you should think about it. Matt Miksic : Okay. So then training starts kicking off. We got those folks trained and they try some cases and towards the end of the year we start hopefully seeing the result of all that. Katherine Owen : Yes. What we really try to underscore is that it is a measured launch. We have to continue to install new robots, they have to get trained, they have to go out and have their OR staff trained and start to do the procedure. It\u2019s not a light switch. It will continue to build throughout the year as we get more robots installed, more systems upgraded and continue with the training. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Katherine Owen : Sorry, operator. I think we cut off the prior caller. So if you could put him back in the call, I think he had a second question. Thanks. Operator : One moment. Kevin Lobo : I will put him back in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Katherine Owen : Operator, maybe just go ahead with the next call and we will put him back in once he\u2019s redialed in. Kevin Lobo : We got him. Operator : Okay. Here we go. Matt Miksic : Hi, can you hear me? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sorry about that Matt. Matt Miksic : No, thanks so much for calling me back in. Sorry to hold up the show there. So Katherine, I was going to ask, just to make sure I don\u2019t get bumped off again, one just quick clarification. I did want to ask you a question Kevin. So the clarification just on the knee volume, you are seeing \u2013 you are taking share here right now today in the fourth quarter, the last couple quarters in knees. I\u2019m just wondering, putting MAKO aside, is there anything else that we can attribute that to, or what else do you think is driving that? Katherine Owen : It isn\u2019t a huge impact other than what we\u2019ve talked about the halo effect from MAKO because obviously we don\u2019t have a lot of folks using the total application. But we\u2019ve also launched new products that have really helped on the knee side. We have our revision cones and sleeves which we introduced, those are 3D printed and they are really helping us gain share in the revision market for knees where we were below our rightful share, if you will. And we\u2019ve also launched some additional 3D printed products, or cementless 3D tibial baseplate \u2013 Matt Miksic : Right. Katherine Owen : That\u2019s help driving a really meaningful shift and the percent of our knees that are done cementless now. So those are probably two couple of the products that we would highlight in addition to some of the MAKO effect that we get when we go into customers who are more open to hearing about our track online. Matt Miksic : Great. Kevin? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Matt Miksic : So the question I wanted to ask you is just one that we get a lot and think about a lot is sort of the range of scenarios that we\u2019re looking at here in the first half with actions coming out of DC. I\u2019d love to hear just if you are thinking about \u2013 you must be thinking about sort of planning around variability or uncertainties to way things could go and what could happen. I\u2019d love to think about how you are positioning the business or if you feel like you need to position the business for any variety of scenarios that might unfold, whether ACA or tax or anything else. Kevin Lobo : Well, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think this earnings call is going to be a great time to sort of go into this, Matt. I mean, there\u2019s so many different scenarios that we\u2019re looking at, whether it\u2019s around tax reform, whether it\u2019s around propeller replace. And all I can tell you is we do have a lot of those scenarios, but I think in the interest of time for this earnings call, I don\u2019t think this is really the best time to get into this because it will take me 10 minutes to kind of go through all of that. Matt Miksic : Fair enough. Kevin Lobo : I\u2019ll apologize in advance for that. And I think we will find another [indiscernible] where that would be a better place to go through those scenarios. But all in all, I can tell you we are not overly concerned. I mean, we feel that\u2019s a progral policies in general are probably a net positive for us. But there are a lot of other uncertainties that we\u2019ll have to see play out. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is coming from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi. Good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Glenn Novarro : Great. Kevin, I wonder if you can just broadly comment on the knee and hip volumes in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And the reason I\u2019m asking is, your numbers came in better than we expected, so did Zimmer, and J&J numbers too were fine. So I\u2019m just wondering, when we add up the fourth quarter, do you think there was like greater seasonality in the fourth quarter? In other words, this trend of patients holding off into the fourth quarter, was that greater than expected or some people have asked us, is there a possibility that we have seen a pull forward of procedures because individuals are worried about their insurance for 2017? I just wondered if you can comment on what I just said and may be any trends that you saw in the fourth quarter. I had a follow-up on the extremities. Katherine Owen : Glenn, I\u2019ll take the first question. We haven\u2019t seen anything with our mix of businesses to suggest that there was some type of effect tied to ACA or changes in Obamacare. The nature of our procedure really don\u2019t lend themselves to it. The election was in November. So if you think about people who get hip and knee procedures specifically going into their primary, getting referred to a surgeon, scheduling that and then the holidays, it\u2019s just not something that we saw where there was a big rush of procedures. What we saw and all the evidence as we\u2019ve looked at this as you can imagine, so just it was normal seasonality. We\u2019ve seen a multi-year trend now of Q4 seasonality, more a function of rising deductibles than anything else. But there was nothing that we would point to as a stand out in Q4 to suggest that that trend was different, accelerated or indicative of greater than normal pull-through. And then I know you had a second question. Glenn Novarro : Yes. Just on extremities, Kevin or Katherine, could you talk about the foot and ankle growth in the fourth quarter and the trends your businesses seeing? And then can you comment on shoulders? I know that\u2019s an area that you\u2019ve got a lot of new products coming out that you\u2019re excited about. Then maybe comment on foot, ankle and shoulders. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Sure. So our foot and ankle business continues to perform extremely well, strong double-digit growth, so north of 15% growth in the fourth quarter and that just been a continuation of what you\u2019ve seen over the past four or five years, really pleased with the performance of that business. As it relates to upper extremities, we\u2019re still a relatively small player and we\u2019re starting to grow nicely. We have a both the total shoulder, the reverse shoulder and now we have a new fracture system, as well. So the only thing we\u2019re missing is just the partial, that\u2019s one product left to have a complete portfolio. But we have the main products that are needed to really be able to drive improved growth. And so I do expect upper extremities to be a positive for us. Although we are small and it\u2019s not a market growth story like it is in foot and ankle, we\u2019re going to have to take share, so it will probably take us a little longer than it did in foot and ankle to post those kinds of numbers. But we are encouraged. We have most of the portfolio cover now and we\u2019re well-positioned to start to grow in upper extremities. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. You may proceed. Rick Wise : Good afternoon, everybody. Let me start with capital priorities for 2017. Does the share repo just likely not much incremental M&A in 2017? You\u2019ve done Sage and Physio, et cetera. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate, right now with the MAKO launch, et cetera. So we should think 2017 might be less likely to see more M&A? Kevin Lobo : You should definitely not read that in to it. $250million is a pretty modest amount of share repos and that\u2019s just offset dilution. We continue to be actively looking across our portfolios for acquisitions and we have the financial capacity to do more deals. Obviously if the deals don\u2019t materialize over a period of time, then we may want to do additional share repurchase. But our capital allocation strategy and velocity has not changed at all prior to as acquisitions and we have the capacity and the willingness to do more deals. Certainly, medical had a terrific year. Organically, while integrating two big acquisitions, but our other divisions all have bandwidth to be able to take on acquisitions. Rick Wise : Okay. And Kevin just a follow-up, Europe, strong performer in your words, obviously you\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of positive work over the last several years, reestablishing, refocusing the European franchise. How much more opportunity is left, for I guess \u2013 for one of a better phrase that\u2019s a catch up growth. How do we think about the right growth they are over 2017 and beyond? Kevin Lobo : So this Europe, we expect to continue to be accretive to Stryker\u2019s overall growth rate. And this is a multi-year platform for us. Its \u2013 Europe is only about 11% of our sales. And so if you look at most other med tech companies, it\u2019s a much larger proportion of their sales. We are really just scratching the surface with some of our divisions, if I look at endoscopy, if I look at instruments. We have huge growth potentials in front of us. Trauma, we already have a pretty good size business, but even as you saw in the fourth quarter, with our hip and knee business, we are very underpenetrated in Europe versus other markets. So I expect this to be a many year story and very excited about the progress we\u2019re making. Even divisions we\u2019re making spin are starting to turn around after years of being underrepresented. So expect this at least five years, five plus years you should expect Europe to continue to be a really positive story for us as we \u2013 as you say catch up to the market shares that we \u2013 should be having in those regions. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to first start off, Kevin and Katherine, about the MAKO halo effect. I know you\u2019ve seen some benefit from some of the installs over the last couple of years with MAKO under Stryker\u2019s roof. I wondered if you could give details in terms of what units you\u2019re seeing benefit from these MAKO installs to date, and whether the halo could get bigger and broader as we get into the total knee application? Kevin Lobo : So I think the initial halo that we are seeing is really more limited to our joint replacement business. So if they buy a robot, even if they\u2019re not doing total knee is with Stryker with our triathlon knee they know that application is coming and they will start to get familiar with the implant. As 40% of those robots are in competitive accounts. So, that\u2019s part of the halo effect, and they start to get to learn about our company, they meet our salesperson, they understand how good our service is. I would say at this point that the Halo has really extended into the other divisions of Stryker. That usually takes longer, but that\u2019s what I would characterize as immediate Halo effect. Josh Jennings : Great. If I could jut follow up with my understanding is you have a global hip cup launch early this year. Is that going to be at AAOS? And how big of a deal should we be thinking that could be? Is this similar to the 3D tibial plates and revision cones? Or, a more moderate impact? Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Yes thanks. We are excited about this launch of [indiscernible] a modern 3D printed version. It\u2019s not as much of a game changer as the tibial base plate because today, all hips are being done without cement, and this cup, even though we really like it, it\u2019s very streamlined it has some very nice features, it\u2019s not causing you to change the way you do the procedure. Our 3D printed knee has enabled people to not use cement anymore and that\u2019s much more of a game changer, over 15% of our knees now are done without cement. So I wouldn\u2019t look at as explosive launch as the 3D printed product for knees, but still saw very nice addition, we had terrific innovations over the innovations over the past four or five years and are stems and now this is a really nice innovation in our cup. But I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a big game changing launch. It\u2019s a nice addition to our portfolio and hopefully that will help our sales force maintain some him focus on hips. As you know, they are very excited about Mako and so same sales force selling both knees and hips. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s a nice launch but more of an incremental launch. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. You may proceed. Young Li : Hi, this is Young Li in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess, first question, on 3D printing, we have a lot of 3D printing capability and expertise. It could be a more sophisticated manufacturing process. I was wondering if you can maybe talk about some of the areas of focus, in terms of maybe using it to introduce some new implants in orthopedics or spine? Kevin Lobo : Right now, we are actually just trying to build capacity. The demand for 3D printing has been really explosive. You\u2019ve seen the growth that\u2019s been generated through our knee franchise. We\u2019re seeing same kind of growth in spine with the interbody device, we\u2019re going to launch more products, and frankly, we\u2019ve been capacity constrained in the spine area. So we have a series of innovative products and I would say our primary focus is really in joint replacement and in spine. And we\u2019re just building \u2013 we built a whole entire building that\u2019s going to be housed with only 3D printing machines in Cork, Ireland, and we are in the process of filling that building with machinery. We are not looking to replace any of our core products. We have the global hip cup that\u2019s going to be 3D printed. So, we think of it as launching new products, creating new innovations and really, it\u2019s focused on those areas. For now, trauma really has some ideas about some thoughts, but nothing really on the immediate horizon. Young Li : Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess, MAKO, I was wondering if you can maybe provide some comments on your utilization trends, on a per robot or per doctor basis? Just wondering how much that\u2019s changed since you bought it? Katherine Owen : Yes, it\u2019s probably not a level of detail we are going to get into. Obviously, the value to the customers continue to increase as we\u2019ve layered on new indications, as well as being able to put power brands onto the robots. We are really pleased, and we\u2019ve been very thoughtful in terms of making sure whenever we place a robot, the surgeon champion is there to make sure these are utilized to their full capacity. So, again, we are pleased with what we\u2019ve seen since we acquired it, but we\u2019re probably not going to get into that level of detail. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum from William Blair. You may proceed. Kaila Krum : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just thinking about large joint pricing, and you enter 2017 and recognizing a lot of pressures that are out there. But I\u2019m curious if you would see an opportunity, potentially, for more favorable contracted implant pricing just with the total knees, as surgeons become more dependent on you and the robot, and then just how that dynamic, specifically, might be incorporated into 2017, guidance, if at all? Katherine Owen : Yes, we assume a pretty stable pricing environment in ortho as well as for Stryker overall, as you heard Glenn referenced that 1.5% to 2% negative pricing that we are anticipating contemplates that. We don\u2019t assume any dramatic change in either direction and that dynamic regardless of the Mako launch. Kaila Krum : Okay. Thanks. And then in your spine business, you mentioned a lot of the supply issues will continue into Q1. Can you just give us a sense for your level of confidence that those impacted customers will ultimately return in the second quarter, and just look gives you that level of confidence? Katherine Owen : I just think given the strength of the portfolio overall, we\u2019ve launch some new products including 3D printed that have been really well received. And while it\u2019s never good to disappoint your customers, I think the strength of our sales force, their focus on the customers and their ability to go back with some differentiated products, I think they have work to do but we have confidence that they will be able to address those customer concerns. Kevin Lobo : Yes, one thing I was really pleased about, I mean, our spine leadership team has managed through a very tough year, when you have these kind of product challenges, and the sales force, I was at our spine sales meeting recently. The mood was really terrific, we were able to retain our sales force something five, six years ago, I\u2019m not sure we would have been as successful. A lot of that is really the plans around 3D printing and other innovations. We have a pretty good pipeline coming. We have weathered the storm, and I think we are feeling we are in a good position, and will start to see that fruit in the second-quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening and thank you for taking the questions. There are two of them. The first one is, you\u2019ve been very good at keeping our expectations tempered for the MAKO ramp in 2017. But how, do we think about this in 2018 and beyond as sort of a continuously arcing adoption, or a multiplier effect? Or how do you internally think about the impact of your new product launches? Katherine Owen : Yes, I think as it relates to MAKO, first of all, we\u2019ve never done a launch of this magnitude in something where we are fundamentally changing how orthopedics joint replacement is done and that\u2019s a way of saying there\u2019s a lot of unknowns. We feel really terrific about the limited release, taking the time to optimize the training protocol, to contemplate the needs of both, surgeons who have a strong understanding of robots, as well as those who don\u2019t. And as we talked about at the analyst meeting, that all went really, really well. So with the 50 or so surgeons trained we feel great about going into full commercial release, I\u2019m sure we learn a lot as this year unfold. But based on everything we\u2019re seeing and hearing, admittedly a lot of that\u2019s going to be anecdotal for now. We believe this is a game changer. So we would expect to continue to build on that momentum in 2018 and I think this is going to be a multi-year rollout and process of gaining market share as we not only continue to install new robots, but also the utilization of the coming up on 400 globally, and then the bulk of which were in the U.S., as those are all robots are upgraded to the total knee. So this is much more than a 2017, 2018 story. This will be a multi-year rollout. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. And my follow-up is in terms of sales forces build? You commented that you\u2019ve been able to retain your spine sales force but thinking across orthopedics, where are you in terms of net ads? Kevin Lobo : So, as it relates to MAKO, the ads are not so much in the sales force the ads are much more with the MAKOplasty specialist. So we have this clinical person that\u2019s in the operating room, helping the surgeon really make sure that that they can do the procedure. And our sales reps will have more room to hunt. So, the ads that we\u2019ve made obviously our extremities business has been growing very robustly and we\u2019ve been adding in the extremities sales force. Our sports medicine business has been strong double-digit growth. We\u2019ve been adding the sales reps in our sports medicine business. So, if you look at the areas of the business that are growing, I mean you are growing strong double-digits in a number of areas those are the areas where we continue to believe specialized sales forces drive growth Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen : Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, one neurovascular one MAKO. So, Katherine, it looks like the surpassed U.S. trial was completed in December 2016. When are we going to see that data? When do expect U.S. approval? And can you remind us of the size of the U.S. flow toward market and I have one follow-up. Katherine Owen : So, the one-year data, I\u2019ll follow-up on specifics but you are probably looking at late this year, or sometime at the beginning of 2018 and we\u2019re looking for a launch in the 2018 timeframe, probably the latter part. Larry Biegelsen : Got it. And then on MAKO, Katherine, are you willing to share with us metrics for example, over the next five years representing total knee volume you think MAKO will represent? What percent of the installed base do think it will add the total knee application? And lastly, what percent of MAKO total knee procedures do expect to come from competitor surgeons? I know you\u2019ve given a metric like 40% of new system sales or to competitor surgeons. Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine Owen : Yes. I think we need to get into the full commercial release. Again, this is new territory for us. I think we\u2019ve done everything we can to optimize our positioning ahead of the full commercial release. But it would be a level of specificity in detail we just don\u2019t have. So, we\u2019re really pleased that we have, as you mentioned, 40%-plus of the installs they went to competitive accounts. I think that speaks to how appealing this processes for a variety of surgeons. And as we get into the full commercial release we\u2019ll look and see what additional data make sense. But candidly, five years out, all I know is that if we\u2019re successful in the execution here we\u2019ll have captured meaningful market share. But it\u2019s premature right now to put out specific targets as to where we expect to be. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Kevin, now that you\u2019ve anniversary the tough emerging markets comps and you started to see some growth again. How do you back on offense there? I know, you\u2019ve said it won\u2019t be quick. But do you have what you need internally to get that piece of the business where it needs to be? Or do you need to think about supplementing that with some local assets or expertise? Kevin Lobo : I think for us, our challenge is largely being more of people challenge than a product challenge. We are very small, we\u2019re subscale, we haven\u2019t necessarily made the investments like other companies have made with bricks and mortar training. So we really have \u2013 we\u2019re in the process of recruiting a new leader for China. I\u2019m happy with our India business. That\u2019s been really performing well over the past few years. But we\u2019re starting from a small place. Latin America has gone through a lot of challenges for us. We still have work to do, same in Turkey. So for us, its just a question of \u2013 we\u2019re subscale. And we are subscale attracting the best talent is really challenging. So, I would say for the next couple of years our focus is much more on talent and making sure we do the right kind of investments in training and education. That type of offense. We actually have very good products. In fact, I\u2019m very excited about some of the products we\u2019re launching that are lower priced. We\u2019re launching a new power tool called System G, which is getting great feedback it\u2019s a very new launch. We\u2019ve never done this before. A made for emerging markets product, we have the low-priced bed that\u2019s made in Turkey at our Muka facility. And then we have Trauson in which we \u2013 we had a good start with Trauson, but I would say with all the other challenges going on in China, that has been more challenge in the last year or two. So its really one of those stories, right. I think unlike Europe, we could see that if we just put a bit of spending behind Europe in specialization, we could turn that on very quickly because the business model is very similar to what we experience in Canada, the U.S., Australia, other markets where we\u2019ve been successful. Emerging markets requires a different kind of offense. And I don\u2019t want to over invest and really have the money go up in flames. So we\u2019re going to be a bit more measured. And the first step is to really make sure we have the right talent, which is frankly the key to our success in other markets. And that will be our first focus. Chris Pasquale : That\u2019s helpful. And then can you just comment on the recent Lifepak recall and what impact that has on the Physio business? Is that a headwind for you? Or could you actually benefit from it, to the extent it encourages customers to think about upgrading? Katherine Owen : Yes. I would say right now it\u2019s premature on that front. We do have a limited ship old right now it is on an older generating AED product and we\u2019re working through that. We don\u2019t expect it to be a material issue. And I would also note it\u2019s not related to the competitor issues that are out there recently. So, we feel good about our pipeline of products and our ability to manage throughout this recall. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. You may proceed. Bruce Nudell : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, my first question, forgive my ignorance. But, what is the basis for product superiority of 3D printed products in cementless knees and revisions. And how does that potentially over the long run tie in with robots? Kevin Lobo : So, there are two main benefits I would say, one is porosity. So you can really have a tremendously strong, so for titanium it\u2019s very strong but it is very porous, which enables the bone to grow into the implant. That\u2019s one, so porosity and geometry. I\u2019m not an expert, so engineers probably have five other things that they would tell you. But those are the high-level hop-to things. So geometry are the shapes of our 3D cones, you cannot make those shapes unless they are 3D printed. And they\u2019re beautiful for the surgeon to be able to drop in. It saves them a lot of time, fits the anatomy really well. The porosity, that\u2019s the reason why we can do cementless knees, is the bone grows in beautifully. We had a claim from the FDA for our spine interbody device that our device promotes bone in growth, unlike peak devices that obviously bone does not grow into the device. So it\u2019s porosity and it\u2019s geometry. Bruce Nudell : Perfect. When you think about \u2013 it sounds like the MedSurg products, the core MedSurg products, are well configured for European demand. But could you contrast the size of the U.S. core MedSurg market versus that in Europe, and your relative shares? Kevin Lobo : Well just at a very high level, and this is very high level I would say our market shares in Europe are about half the markets share we enjoy in the United States. Just to give you round numbers. That\u2019s actually the area where we have the most upside and those are the same competitors that we compete with in the United States. We have a long way to go in power tools. A long way to go on cameras. A long way to go in beds and I\u2019m really excited about the potential. Our emergency power cuts we\u2019ve done extremely well in Europe, but rest of the MedSurg portfolio we have significant runway given it\u2019s not like we\u2019re five share points low, we are about half our marketshares in many of these spots. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just to focus on gross margins for a little bit. Saw a pretty big step down after Sage and Physio. Q2 of last year, as you anniversary those, get more favorable mix, especially from neuro. Should we expect gross margins to start kicking higher in Q2, and throughout the course of the year? Kevin Lobo : Matt, if you remember from Analyst Day we provided guidance around operating margin and top line. So we\u2019re not really going to provide additional guidance around the details of gross margin. I will say that \u2013 keep in mind \u2013 as you think about mix of our business is. As you think about MedSurg having slightly lower margin and Orthopaedics having slightly higher margins, a lot of that gets made up in term of the SG&A mix as that slows down to the operating margin line. So I think that\u2019s probably all we will guide relative to gross margin this year. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. Moving over to the MedSurg side of the business and endoscopy, one of your competitors is readying to launch there with some new visualization technologies. I\u2019m curious as far as how you feel about your position in the market from a technology perspective, and whether or not you need to upgrade some of your visualization capabilities? And if you\u2019d be even interested in doing something externally to help you out there? Kevin Lobo : When you say upgrade do want to be more specific please and what you mean? Matthew O\u2019Brien: Specifically philosophy and imaging there and your technologies, and if there\u2019s any improvement that you are expecting from new technologies over the next year or two, or if you look at external, to augment your capabilities? Kevin Lobo : So we are not going to talk about the external areas that we\u2019re going to focus on. And we\u2019re also, not going to talk about product pipeline beyond what we\u2019ve indicated. We are really thrilled with our camera it operate extremely well. I\u2019m not sure if you are referring to \u2013 for open surgery DACs \u2013 XO scopes am not sure, I\u2019m really non sure what you are referring to every division has identified their pathway and their pipeline for innovation. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re talking about 3D. I\u2019m not sure if you are talking about what specifically you are referring to. What I tell you is the 1588 is only a year into the launch and it\u2019s getting fantastic feedback and I would expect that endoscopy continue to have terrific growth with 1588. They are on the lookout constantly for improvements to the product portfolio but we are going to talk about that until we end up consummating that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jeffries. Your line is open. Raj Denhoy : Hi thanks. I know it\u2019s late. Maybe two quick ones. Pricing, I think you gave us the metric for orthopedic pricing, and it did worsen a bit over the course of the year. I think it was 1.7% in the first quarter and now it\u2019s 2.5%. Is there anything to read into that? I\u2019m guessing you will say no, but I thought I\u2019d ask anyway. Kevin Lobo : We haven\u2019t seen any big change. It does move around quarter-to-quarter and it depends on the timing of launches in selling days and no more quarterly in year-over-year variability, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that. Raj Denhoy : Okay. Secondly, Sage and Physio-Control, I think you gave the growth rates there, 11.8% and 7.4%. Both doing quite well, and that\u2019s close to $1 billion in annual revenue that\u2019s about to move from your acquired into organic. Is there any reason to think that those businesses will slow in 2017? How do we think about the outlook there? Kevin Lobo : No. As we said, we expect them, I think Glenn in his prepared comments, as we anniversary those in the second quarter they will be accretive to organic growth rate. Obviously we\u2019ve got a big base but those I sizable businesses. We continue to target double-digit growth for Sage and the types of gains we\u2019ve been seeing in Physio, that parts rolls out new products. I would underscored Glenn\u2019s comments regarding the first quarter the seasonality shift that will skew the year-over-year comps for Physio. That\u2019s really comparable basis. The underlying business as you\u2019ve seen in the three quarters we\u2019ve owned it, it looks terrific and we look forward for it to be another driver of organic growth. Glenn Boehnlein : I would like to add this medical division of ours, to create deals of those sides and delivers for the full year in the U.S. almost 10% growth on the base business is really a terrific performance. To have that much business and still deliver that kind of growth on the base business is really outstanding. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citi. Your may proceed. Lee Preston : Hi, this is Lee Preston on for Amit. Two quick ones. For hips and knees, are you modeling any negative impact in your 2017 guidance for bundled payments at this point? Kevin Lobo : We\u2019ve talked about bundled payments for the last couple of years and at no time have we ever said that bundled payments is going to be causing a problem to our growth. It\u2019s been around for five years on a commercial paying side and was CJR you\u2019ve just seen we\u2019ve come through year and the entire market had CJR in effect on the markets doing very well. Short answer is bundled payments is not a headwind for our hip and knee business. Not just for Stryker, but for the entire market. Lee Preston : Okay. Got it. On Neurotech and spine, the segment operating margin was up a good amount in 2016. To what attempt is that sustainable? Kevin Lobo : Neurotech and Spine? Lee Preston : Yes. Kevin Lobo : I\u2019m sorry. Katherine Owen : So, we don\u2019t model out the individual op margin by the division, neuro, those are high-margin businesses for us. But we don\u2019t model out or provide guidance for the specific segments. We give that total company op margin 30 to 50 basis points target and that\u2019s one of the contributors to that. Kevin Lobo : That\u2019s certainly, the Neurotech and Spine business are profitable businesses and they see in high grow business. So that\u2019s certainly that mix has helped the company. Operator : And our next question comes from the Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good evening. This is Robey in for Rich. Can you hear me? Kevin Lobo : Yes. We can. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, great. Thanks, for taking the questions. Just a couple. One on Mako and one on the longer-term strategic view. In the near term for MAKO, I know everyone is talking about four to five years \u2013 just curious. Can MAKO upon ramp or next 6-12 months driver of growth rate up \u2013 beyond this sort of nice mid-single-digit, high-single-digit level you\u2019ve come to into the double-digit territory? Are should we think of it more as sort of maybe cannibalizing some of your non-robotic is? And then secondly, just in terms of helping us engage risk around manufacturing, it sounds like you are working on this 3D printing plant in Ireland. How do we sort of factor in some of the comments at the administration is making around manufactured in America. As it pertains to Stryker\u2019s production and where your products are made? Thanks. Katherine Owen : Maybe I will just start with the first question. I would say we continue to anticipate, as we launch the total Knee, that it will help drive meaningful market share gains starting as we exit 2017, we are not assuming any cannibalization there will be those customers who continue to use triathlon traditionally and as you can see there\u2019s an strong demand as we continued to install and upgrade robots to the new knee application Kevin Lobo : Yes. As it relates to the second question, we have a very global manufacturing environments, which includes significant manufacturing in United States. We do have 3D printing machines here in United States as well is in Ireland. Obviously, we decided to have a purpose building and we are scaling up that manufacturing and then we also make implants here in United States and most of our MedSurg products are made in the U.S. So I think compared to other big multi-nationals of our size, I think we\u2019re actually pretty well-positioned regardless of \u2013if we have more attached or some type of offset to the lower corporate tax rate. I think we will be in pretty good shape. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could squeeze one housekeeping question. I might\u2019ve missed this earlier due to some connection issue. What was the selling day impact in the quarter? Where there any extra fewer selling days in 4Q? Kevin Lobo : Fourth quarter, there were no change in days. Same day as the year before. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. You may proceed. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevin, I will go back to your comments there just on the U.S. manufacturing. Is there any numbers you can give us \u2013 are there any number you can give us at this point on what percentage of your U.S. revenue is generated by products manufactured in the U.S.? It sounds like the answer is yes but you have some flexibility. I would assume you could move that around if you needed to from a quarter tax standpoint? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Jeff, this is Glenn. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity around details of the specific broader tax. But as you look at our manufacturing footprint and when you look it, what we bring into the U.S. the sale, that might be made outside the U.S. We are roughly around a 50/50 split in terms of the impact to us. Jeff Johnson : All right. That\u2019s helpful. And Kevin, maybe on guidance. Going back to the Analyst Day, 9% is the floor is the floor is the floor. If I adjust for FX and deal accretion in the ASU adjustment bring your 2017 guidance, I\u2019m closer to 7% to 9% EPS growth in your 2017 guidance. That\u2019s a lot of moving parts, I understand. But shall I just view that as a reason that kind of views, as assume your guidance is conservative here or there anything changed since the Analyst day? Just kind of how I think about that 7% to 9% \u2013 versus 9% being the floor? Kevin Lobo : No. I think we can help you with that math that we can get offline. We are definitely not delivering a number below 9%. So I think there is something in your math that we can talk to you offline. We\u2019re definitely there is no change at all in our stands and this guidance firmly reflects. I think there might be something in the deal accretion that you might have off in your model. We will be happy to take that offline. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed. Kyle Rose : Great, thanks for fit me in. I just had one quick question on the MAKO side. I appreciate not wanted to give significant long-term guidance. But just from a near-term perspective, just why don\u2019t you just give any color related to the amount of robots that have been upgraded to the knee application to date. How should we think about it with the 50 trained surgeons? I mean should we think about it as 50 sites or multiple surgeons at one site? Any insight there. And 86 robots year-to-date and great year-over-year growth just when you think about 2017 and balancing the upgrades to the knee application as well as seeking out some of the new placement. Did you thinking continue to grow the new placements at the rate that we saw year-over-year from 2016 versus 2015? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. We are probably not going to get too specific in terms of outlook for robots installed obviously, we would look to continue to grow that. But keep in mind it is going to be balance between that and upgrading existing robots, as we mentioned. So it will be both of those drivers and we\u2019re not going to get into the level of detail around system upgrades and then you like it\u2019s probably getting down into the weeds a bit too much, particularly relative to the total size of the company. But we are really pleased with how the limited launch has gone. That\u2019s not only the training, the training protocol, the outcome of the experiences surgeons had as well as the training sites we\u2019ve been able to bring on board. We are in a great position for Academy. We will have roughly 50 surgeons trained. We have done a significant volume of surgeries that they will be well-positioned to help start the training and as we go through the year we will continue to give you data points that we think are relevant and we\u2019ll look to see how the year unfolds. So yes, expect more robots to be placed but probably too soon to start talking about exactly how much bigger year-over-year given this new dynamic of upgrades. Kevin Lobo : What I would say is I\u2019m delighted with the MAKO capital sales force. They\u2019ve done terrific job selling these robots and in the fourth quarter doing upgrades and every quarter we will continue to tell you how many robots we\u2019ve sold. Kyle Rose : Great, thank you very much. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. It just wanted to ask one housekeeping. The $250 million that you had mentioned you are going to be doing going forward, in the stock repurchases, is that included in the guidance, or is that something that you would continue to do on a one-off basis? Glenn Boehnlein : Hi, Krist. This is Glenn. It\u2019s included in the guidance. Kristen Stewart : Okay. Perfect. Just one other thing. Anything we should look at beyond AA West this year, in terms of either procedures or any other clinical meetings that may come up in terms of the Neurotech business, or endoscopy, or anything else? Katherine Owen : Yes. We will have a presence at a number of meetings. As you\u2019ll recall, in 2016 we had a presence at SAGES and NASS and the like. So as we get to Academy we will switch gears and start thinking about some of the additional meetings and what segments will be highlighted. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I wanted to say Kristen, we are starting to show up in a lot of these specialty meetings more and more. You talked about the extremities society. There\u2019s a whole series of those societies that we are showing up in sports medicine meetings. These smaller societies where we have very, very fast growth, with those big tend to be a lot more impact full. There\u2019s a large ACS type of meetings. We really large specialized business units with specialized sales force are more and more going to specialized conferences, something like SAGES for our endoscopy division. We\u2019re starting to see it\u2019s kind of shift where are these society meetings be specialized ones are much more impactful ever use of our time and money and we get great insight and new technologies. We get to just shows our surgeons or innovations and that\u2019s going to continue to be an engine of growth for us. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2017 results will be held on April 25. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management) Operator : Welcome to the first quarter 2017 Stryker earnings call. My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO, and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. Our Q1 sales performance underscores the strength of our businesses, with organic sales growth topping 8%. We had one extra selling day, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point of growth. While the sales performance was strong across the organization, MedSurg was a standout, delivering organic growth of 10.8%, as new products and sales force execution drove market share gains. The Orthopaedics and Neurotech and Spine segments were solid in the quarter, posting organic sales gains of 7.2% and 5.3% respectively. On a geographic basis, growth was 7.6% in the U.S., while OUS delivered gains of 9.9%. OUS growth was driven by strong performances in Europe, Canada, and Australia. Acquisitions contributed roughly 10.6% to Q1's growth, recognizing the previously discussed factors that impacted Physio's first quarter performance, while lingering recall challenges limited Sage's growth. We remain confident in the underlying strength of both Physio and Sage and expect them to be back on track for the balance of the year. Our particularly strong top line performance allowed us to make key strategic investments and sustain healthy R&D spending. Adjusted per-share earnings increased approximately 19%, topping the high end of our range at $1.48 per share. Looking ahead, our Q1 results reflect strong momentum and support of our ongoing strategy of investing in focused sales teams, internal innovation, and acquisitions. We are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year targets and once again grow sales at the high end of MedTech with leveraged earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on MAKO. During Q1 we installed 18 robots globally, of which 11 were in the U.S. We also continue to upgrade existing robots in the field, a process that is ramping nicely and we expect will continue through 2018. As many of you on the call are aware, following a highly focused limited launch, we initiated the full commercial release of the total knee at last month's AAOS [American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons] meeting. Since the launch, we have trained over 200 surgeons on the TKA [Total Knee Arthroplasty] application at roughly 90 different locations. We have 40 training locations in the U.S., with another five OUS, which is helping drive volumes of MAKO TKA procedures, which are accelerating monthly. We remain focused on ensuring a highly successful MAKO TKA launch, with outcomes that we believe will benefit our customers and patients. The feedback from surgeons has been very positive, and we believe this underscores the methodical approach we took as part of the limited market release in order to optimize the user experience. For those of you at the recent AAOS meeting, the excitement around the MAKO TKA application was apparent at our MAKO surgeon event, which was attended by 1,600 healthcare professionals, many of whom also attended the 25 MAKO TKA demonstrations conducted over the course of the academy meeting. We believe the excitement around the TKA application will be evident in our knee market shares, which while already outpacing the market, we continue to expect even greater share gains as we exit 2017. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. Today I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. We have provided our detailed financial results in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 8.2% in the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 included one more selling day, which had the impact of adding roughly 1% in growth. Keep in mind that the selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.4% impact on sales. Both U.S. and international sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with first quarter organic growth of 7.6% and 9.9% respectively. Both geographies benefited from the extra selling day. In the U.S., there were strong performances across Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology. International sales growth demonstrated solid gains in Europe, Canada, and Australia and benefited from favorable emerging market comparables. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.48 increased 19.4% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions, operating expense control, and the benefit of the change in accounting guidance for tax benefits from certain stock compensation expenses now included in our tax provision. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted $0.04 by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 7.8% and organic growth of 7.2%, including organic growth of 7.4% in the U.S. This performance was highlighted by positive performances in knees at 7.2% and trauma and extremities at 8.7%. The primary drivers of performance in the quarter included strong demand for our 3D printed products, our foot and ankle portfolio, and our MAKO platform. Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 6.8%, with solid performances in Europe, Canada, and Australia. MedSurg continued to have strong performances across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 36.6% and organic gains of 10.8%, which included a 9.6% increase in the U.S. Instruments had a good performance coming off a strong order book in Q4, with U.S. organic sales growth of 7.8%. This included continued momentum related to its Neptune waste management business. Additionally, instruments also shipped initial units of its newest power tool product line, System 8. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 14.3%. This reflects strong demand for its video platform, booms and lights, and sports medicine products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.4%, driven by its core bed, stretcher, and power cot products. As discussed previously, Physio's results were impacted by a tough quarterly comparable that included the legacy company's fiscal year end. As such, Medical's Physio business was down 18% on a comparable basis. Medical Sage business grew 3%, which was below our expectations and primarily related to the ongoing recovery from last year's product recall issues. This resulted in some interruption of supply to customers. During the quarter, Sage continued to work through resupplying these customers and anticipates a full recovery by the end of the second quarter. Both Sage and Physio acquisitions anniversary in the second quarter, and we continue to anticipate that they will be accretive to our earnings as previously guided. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.7%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparables in China. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 7.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products, offset by softness in our Spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 9.7% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our ischemic stroke products, CMF products, and our neuro powered instruments. Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see the residual impact of supply issues. We expect some easing of these issues in the second quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 9.8%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.5% was down 150 basis points from prior-year quarter but up 20 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016. As compared to the prior-year first quarter, gross margin was unfavorably impacted primarily by acquisitions as well as business mix and foreign currency. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.8% of sales, which was 160 basis points favorable to the prior-year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from business mix, including the impact of leverage from acquisitions, and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our Cost Transformation for Growth [CTG] program. This favorability is primarily offset by continued planned investments in our CTG program, our ERP project, and certain expenses related to launching our MAKO TKA platform. R&D, with spending at 6.5% of sales, continues to reflect our commitment to innovation. In total, adjusted operating expenses were 42.3% of sales, which was 150 basis points favorable to the prior-year quarter. With the strong top line momentum, we anticipate continuing to make investments related to CTG and MAKO in the second quarter as we execute these programs to drive longer-term share growth and leverage. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales and essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. Our operating margin reflects good leverage offset by key investments related to driving future operational savings and product growth platforms. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitment of driving 30 to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin. Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Our other expenses increased primarily due to higher net interest expense associated with increased acquisition-related borrowings that were not outstanding in the prior-year quarter. This is partially offset by increased interest income. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 15.3% reflects an underlying operating tax rate of 18%, offset by a 2.7% benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses. As a reminder, the first quarter includes the bulk of the benefit of this accounting change, and moving forward we would anticipate an effective tax rate closer to 17%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position, with $3.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 85% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.2 billion. Turning to cash flow, our first quarter cash from operations was approximately $151 million. During the quarter, we completed a $230 million share repurchase, which will offset the impact of dilution in 2017. And turning to Q2 guidance, we reaffirm our expectation of organic annual sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2017. As a reminder, Q2 and Q3 will have one less selling day as compared to 2016, and Q4 has the same number of selling days. Finally, for 2017, we reaffirm that our adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $6.35 to $6.45 for the full year. For the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.48 to $1.52, which includes the aforementioned investment, foreign currency impacts, and the impact of the accounting change for stock compensation. I will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.: Good afternoon. Maybe, Kevin, one for you and then maybe one on MAKO. So, Kevin, just thinking about the strength in the first quarter, obviously even adjusted for the selling day, your organic growth is in excess of the top end of your guidance range for the year. So can you just talk about how you see the pacing for the balance of the year? Are there any factors you could point to that would drive deceleration based on the very strong start to the beginning of the year? And then I had a quick follow-up. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Thanks, David. After Q1, we are obviously very happy with how our businesses have performed and the momentum in the business that we have. Keep in mind, as Glenn mentioned, we have one less selling day in each of the next two quarters, and we did start out the year with higher top line targets and a tighter EPS range than we did in the prior year. So at this point we feel great about the guidance we have out there. Let's see where we are at the midpoint before we think about adjusting our ranges, but I would tell you there's nothing out there that I'm worried about. The business momentum is very strong across our portfolio. David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.: Okay. Kevin or others, just thinking about MAKO post-AAOS, our sense is that went at or better than your expectations. So how would you characterize post the meeting training, backlog of systems, or receptivity? And are you still as confident as you were before that we start to see some share movement towards the latter half of this year? Thanks so much. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, David. I would say absolutely the AAOS launch really probably exceeded our expectations, 1,600 healthcare professionals at our MAKO event, but more importantly, I think the interest around the demonstrations and follow-up from surgeons who wanted to get better educated and understand. I'm really pleased with the robots that we installed in the quarter with that same sales force out upgrading systems in the field for the total knee application. So we feel really good about the rollout, the pace we're on. We've tried to be very methodical in approaching the full commercial launch. But with 40 training sites and over 200 surgeons trained and the volumes building monthly, we feel really good about the launch and the rollout for the year. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: David, I'd just add. Our Orthopaedics team did a spectacular job at the AAOS meeting. And I even had tremendous feedback from surgeons from outside of the United States, from Asia, from Europe. And so I think you're going to see MAKO pick up around the world. Obviously, the U.S. is going to be the biggest market. But as you saw even in the first quarter, we sold quite a lot of robots outside the United States. So the meeting was a huge success. We feel very bullish about the TK application with MAKO. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks and good afternoon, guys. Let me start with just one MAKO question because I know you're not going to disclose the number of system upgrades that you're going to do on a quarterly basis with the percentage of your installed base that is upgraded. That's probably the metric that is most interesting to us. So can you give us some insight into where you think you are relative to your plan at this point or your expectations going into the year on the percentage that you have upgraded at this point? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Mike. We feel really good about where we are. We're pacing. We started doing the upgrades in the fourth quarter. They're continuing to accelerate sequentially. We think the process, the vast majority of those robots in the field are going to get upgraded, and that's a process we think will take us through next year. Part of the challenge is, honestly, bandwidth because we have the same capital sales force that we're trying to expand. But they're doing the upgrades; they're doing the new installs. So, it's managing the demand out there. But we feel great about the momentum we're seeing, the level of interest, and we would expect those upgrades to continue to build. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then the commentary on different parts of the MedSurg business, I was hoping you could just spend another minute on, A), on the plus side, I was struck by how strong the Endo business was this quarter. Both U.S. and internationally, it was exceptionally strong. And I think we have a good understanding of why that is. And then B), I think the comps for Physio were harder I think than the Street necessarily appreciated, so that was a bit more challenging. Could you just level-set expectations on Physio after this quarter? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So you're correct on Endo. We're in year two of the 1588 AIM launch. And as you've heard us talk about before and you know well, those tend to be multiyear launch and Q2 is typically a very strong year, but they're also seeing very good momentum with booms and lights and the sports medicine business, which continues to see really nice growth; smaller base, but really pleased with the performance there. Physio, yes, we had talked previously about the difficult comps given really robust first quarter the year ago, compounded by the fact that it wasn't part of us and that was their prior fiscal year end. And as you know, capital businesses tend to be the strongest in the fiscal year end, so we did expect this quarter to reflect those trends. We feel really good about the momentum in that business as well as Sage, which we also expect to be back to a normalized run rate in Q2. So it's really limited to a Q1 event that was much more to do around the comparisons as opposed to anything underlying in the business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, we can. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, good afternoon and congrats on such a strong start to the year. I just wanted to continue that line of questioning on Sage and Physio. So do you guys still expect at this point the same kind of EPS accretion that you talked about previously and for these deals to also be accretive to growth? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yes. Bob, as we look at the forecast for both of those businesses, first of all, as Katherine explained, we did anticipate that Physio would be down just given the comparable in the prior year. Sage maybe is ramping a little bit slower than we had thought just because of the product recall and getting that product back to customers. But for the full year, we're still committed to the guidance we provided of the $0.15 to $0.18 per share, and the growth will be accretive for the full year when we get to the end. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then for my second question, just to stick with MAKO and expectations setting, given that you're providing a net number, how should we think about that over the course of the rest of the year? Should we think about it in terms of steady year-over-year improvement as far as the net number because obviously that's a number that's going to get a lot of scrutiny. I think you placed 86 last year. Is it reasonable to expect a pretty nice uptick this year from a net perspective? I was wondering if you could just set expectations for that net placement number that you gave us. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So I think we haven't guided to a robot number. I think you should assume while the net number will grow year over year, it won't be at the same pace that you've seen from a growth rate perspective as the base has gotten a lot bigger. And also keep in mind that that's only part of the story now. So while we'll continue to report like this quarter the 18 robots installed, just as importantly is that sales force out there doing the upgrades of the fleet, which as you know easily exceeds 300. So the combined force of that, which is all recorded in that other recon revenue line, but it really is both of those. So yes, there will be year-over-year growth in robots installed, but on top of that and really driving a lot of the power of the ability to take market share gains is the number of installations and upgrades that we're doing. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And just to add, Bob, I think we're really encouraged by the knee growth rate. As you recall, last year we had a very strong first quarter in our knee business, and on top of that we grew very well again this quarter. So our knee business has had multiple quarters in a row of growing higher than the market, and we expect that to continue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is open. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to return to the knee growth as well. You said, obviously, knee growth, knee share already outpacing the market, and you expect more. I'm just trying \u2013 just looking at it, worldwide numbers, first quarter up 7.2% against an easy comp, but very much in line with fourth quarter growth. When we think about \u2013 is 7%-plus, is that the kind of growth we should be thinking about the franchise as we look at it for the rest of the year even though you have a tougher comp in the second quarter, given some of the momentum you're talking about, Kevin? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So I'm not sure the comp reference that you're making, Rick, because if you look at last year's first quarter, our knee business in the U.S. was 9% growth. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, I'm sorry. I must be looking at the wrong number. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: If you look at 7.4%, we grew that off of a 9% in the prior year. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So we're feeling great about the knee business. It's gaining momentum. And really, once the total knee \u2013 really that application and those upgrades take hold and the surgeons have a good experience, that's locked-in market share gains. The more surgeons do it and the more that they enjoy that procedure and see the benefits of that procedure, that becomes a locked-in market share. So we expect the momentum to continue, and we had a really outstanding first quarter if you consider that comparison. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Exactly. And you talked about making more MAKO investments. Maybe help us understand what that's going to encompass, specifically I think you said in the second quarter. Obviously, you understand the continuing investment in sales force and upgrades and training. But is there anything over and above that that we should be thinking about? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: No. As Glenn referenced, given the strong start to the year, momentum we're seeing, there was an opportunity to make some strategic investments in a few areas, CTG, ERP, that had been anticipated, as well as MAKO as we've been really pleased with the rollout. But there are obviously always opportunities where if there's investment dollars available that can help drive longer-term growth, we want to take advantage of those. So nothing I'd call out in specifics other than really supporting the overall MAKO TKA launch. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And just accelerating some of our spending plans. So we obviously have a commitment to margin expansion, operating margin expansion for the full year. We're still committed to that. But we have the chance to accelerate some of that spending to really get behind the launch. And so far, we're extremely pleased with the way the launch is going. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Rick, keep in mind that as we described our CTG plan and we describe our operating margin improvement targets, we said at the analyst meeting last year that it would be 30 to 50 basis points, but in the earlier year it would be closer to 30 because of these types of investments that need to be made. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking our question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about Spine, maybe some of the efforts that you're putting in place there in terms of your product line, in terms of the sales force, or just what has been effective that you found in terms of improving the growth rate of that business. How sustainable is that? And then I also \u2013 apologies, I have to ask a question here about MAKO, but I'll start with Spine. Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Okay, sure. So really the biggest part of our growth story in Spine has been our Tritanium, so our 3D-printed interbody device, which is really \u2013 there was a limited launch last year, and that's really accelerating. So we're pleased with that. But we have a number of new products that are going to be 3D-printed that will be launched over the course of this year. We expect that to accelerate our growth. We also are bringing a couple of products back on the market that were off the market for the first \u2013 almost the whole year last year. And so those are just starting to take hold. So we actually expect our Spine business to improve over the course of the year, this quarter being a little bit softer than what we will experience in the next few quarters. Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. And then on Spine \u2013 I mean on MAKO, so I guess one of the things I'd love to understand, we all have heard your comment about back-end, back of the year maybe visible share gains in knees in the U.S., driven by the launch. But can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the dynamics of share or performance of these accounts as you upgrade them versus, as you say, place a new system with the total knee in place? What are those accounts like? Maybe help us understand the dynamics of how those two develop as examples. That would be very helpful. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thanks. Each account has its own story. It's like all politics are local discussions. So certain accounts have surgeons that will quickly adopt and convert most of their procedures to robotic, and other surgeons that will maybe be doing their robotic surgeries on a Friday, and if they're a high-volume surgeon, they may be doing their other normal procedures on a Monday or Wednesday. So it really varies greatly, and it's very early in the launch. So we're really not at a point yet where we could characterize them for you to say a competitive robot takes X amount of time to get to max penetration. We're gathering all of that data. And in future quarters, we'd be able to characterize that more clearly. Today it's really each account has its own story in terms of how it's scaling. But what I can tell you is we're extremely pleased. Where we're placing robots, they're becoming productive, and we're obviously tracking all of those metrics, but it's a little early yet to give you more insight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, so I had two questions really. One, I just wanted to see if you could give any kind of color on why pricing was a little bit better this quarter. If you could give any color on the different segments or if you saw any meaningful change, I would just love to hear about that. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Sure, Matt. Price for the quarter I will say was not as bad as we initially anticipated. But as we think about trends for the year, price is heavily impacted by mix and geography. And so just given that we only have this one quarter and that we did have a mix that was skewed a little more towards MedSurg, which provided some slight favorability, at this time I'm not willing to declare that this is a trend for the whole year. And I think that's where \u2013 so we won't revise our pricing guidance. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then underlying some of the issues that you called out with Physio and Sage, the MedSurg business had a pretty solid quarter. And you did call out in your comments core growth in the beds and cots. I was just curious what you're seeing in the capital environment as it relates to those lines and some of the other instruments that you sell. It seems like things are pretty healthy. Is that a fair characterization? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think we viewed our capital business, and I would stress our capital business because we have a different mix than others, as remaining healthy. There has been no real change, but the environment has been healthy for some time. We're in a strong product cycle, as you see in Endo with the 1588 AIM and now with the early \u2013 the launch of the System 8 within instruments, and these are upgrade cycles. That's something our sales force knows really well how to do in that replacement cycle. So overall, we feel good about the capital environment. I haven't noticed any real changes in those trends versus prior quarters. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I'm really pleased with the Medical team. The core Medical business grew double digit organically on a global basis. And I think Glenn gave you the U.S. business, but internationally grew extremely well, as well. And they're doing this while integrating Sage and Physio and working through some challenges, as we discussed in those businesses. So we're really delighted with the core performance in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon, two questions. The first one has to do with emerging markets. Could you please give us an update on how you're doing in those areas? And then the second one, your trauma and extremity business had a wonderful quarter. Anything behind that that you can share with us? Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure, I'll start with emerging markets. Look, we're really pleased with the performance in India and Brazil. And our China business had good growth, which really benefited more from weaker comps in the prior quarter. But we still have more work to do there, including we're in the process of adding a new Chinese leader. And then once we start to make some changes in China, we expect that China will be a bigger contributor to our growth. But overall, the emerging markets were no longer a headwind, but certainly growing roughly close to the overall average for the company in the first quarter. But we're very pleased with India, very pleased with Brazil. Some of those key markets have been growing very well for us. And certainly, Brazil is a turnaround. India has been a great story for the past four years and now becoming a more meaningful business. So overall, good news, we still have a lot of work to do in China to get that business to where it needs to be. And your second question was on Trauma. We really have terrific performance in our foot and ankle business, driving very high growth, very strong double-digit growth, and that was the biggest contributor. But overall, we had a very strong performance. And Trauma, as you know, has been a great business for us for the past four years, and really pleased in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company LLC : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to ask on the comments you made, Kevin, about the international demand for MAKO. I don't know if you guys have disclosed this historically. But can you give us some idea about where you have approvals, and then what the update is in terms of the total knee indication approval in different territories? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So outside the U.S., and I would underscore the U.S. has been obviously the main market, Australia has been a very healthy market for robot placement, and they have the TKA approval. We have approval for that application in Europe, but it's still very early. So I wouldn't assume a big contribution there. I think you really should think about the U.S. and Australia driving most of the momentum as it relates to this year. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: But we do have a smattering of MAKOs across Southeast Asia, across different European countries. They don't all yet have the TKA, and we're going to be very measured about the total knee launch. As we implement those, we're going to be as disciplined as we are here in the United States. But tremendous interest, and for us it's just pacing \u2013 making sure we put them in the right sites with the right surgeon champions and go through our training. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company LLC : Great. And I just wanted to follow up, another MAKO question. And not to put the cart before the horse, but when you talk about incremental MAKO investments, it just rang a bell that I just had a curiosity about updates, about potential future indications. And if you're not comfortable disclosing where MAKO could potentially go, any idea in terms of when you might give the investment community an update in terms of your path forward there and indications outside of total knee and hip? Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think just given the enormity of the total knee market application and the early stages of the launch, you should view our comments around accelerated some of the investment spending, it's all focused around the total knee. That's where the organization has their efforts focused. Longer term, we'll see what happens, but right now we really have everybody's energies focused around optimizing this launch given the size of the market opportunity and our desire to do it right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Keeler from SunTrust. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first one on MAKO, the other Ortho line was very strong, I guess highlighted \u2013 reflecting the robot placements. Was there anything in that line that was one-time or maybe related to a bolus of training or something like that that maybe mix is not sustainable, or do you think you can continue at that level of growth? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: No, there wasn't anything one-time associated in that number. But keep in mind, it includes bone cement. It includes revenue associated with the robots installed, and it includes the revenue associated with the upgrades as well as some revenue associated with SPS. So, there's a number of items in there, but there was nothing unusual other than the fact that we're installing more robots and doing upgrades. Unknown Speaker : Got it, thanks. And just to drill down on an earlier question on MedSurg pricing where that turned positive in the quarter, what specifically were some of the factors that drove that? And what gives you pause around whether or not that might be sustainable? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: I think when you look at MedSurg, there's a lot of different capital products. They serve a wide customer base. And I would tell you that as you look at these deals, they're negotiated over long periods of time for larger capital. And so I can't say that any one thing pointed to an uptick in price other than the combination of we felt some really good robustness at year end, and that carried over into Q1. And I don't anticipate that we'll consistently be able to deliver a 1% price increase like we did in this quarter for MedSurg. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: But it has been \u2013 certainly that's the one segment that is the least price-sensitive within our portfolio and has been for some time. That MedSurg leadership team has really done a great job of focusing on price, even in terms of how the course is paid. They're paid more if the prices are higher for certain product categories. And so, it's not a new fact that MedSurg can drive price. It was a little bit more positive than we anticipated in the first quarter, but as the mix was very strong in that segment, and that's a segment that has been doing a very good job managing price over the past couple years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, good afternoon. This is J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the System 8 launch. I'm just trying to figure out when that officially launched and maybe some early feedback that you've seen there, and how we should think about how that can contribute to the rest of 2017 and 2018. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So, we just launched in the second quarter here, so that will ramp up as we get into the second half of the year. And as you've seen before, when we launched, whether it's a new power tool or a new camera within Endo, it typically is a multiyear run as we upgrade and hospitals go through their process of upgrading their fleet. So we feel really excited about this. This is right in the wheelhouse of what the instrument team does really well since power tools really drive that business. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: What I'm really pleased about is as System 7 starts to taper, we didn't really see the drop in growth as we had seen in the past. With previous launches, they were able to really make a nice transition from System 7 toward System 8. And I think part of that is the Neptune 3 launch has really helped on the waste management side to offset some of the slowdown, which naturally occurs when you're at the end of a product cycle. So, the instruments team has done a really nice job of holding it together as they prepared for System 8. And it's early days yet. So far the feedback has been very positive, but we'll hear a lot more about that in the next few quarters. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it, and then one more for me, higher level. You guys have made some good investments in 3D printing. There's a lot of buzz around 3D printing implants. It sounds like it's going pretty well in your Spine segment. I'm just wondering strategically where you think you can take this capability across your entire portfolio going forward. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Right now we're in the process. We built an entire building, and we're filling it with 3D printing machines in Cork, Ireland. We have tremendous demand and interest from basically all of our implant businesses for 3D printed products. And we're really focused on innovation. So at this point, all the products that we're launching are really adding innovation, either removing bone cement, creating new geometries that don't exist previously. So we have a pretty healthy pipeline of demands, and we're scaling it as fast as we possibly can to meet the demand. So I'm not going to get into specifics on which products, but we have very healthy demand, and we're extremely -- we gained tremendous experience in 3D printing titanium. So really Titanium is the key metal that we're focused on, but tremendous interest from multiple divisions of Stryker. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC : Thanks and good afternoon, maybe a question just on volumes and the state of the hospital market in the U.S. broadly. And so volumes look to pick up sequentially a bit across all of the divisions, but you had the extra selling day. And really I guess the comments this quarter were mixed, mix from HCA, better from Intuitive, better from J&J, mix from some others. So maybe from where Stryker sits, what are your latest comments on volumes and hospital in general? And then in MAKO specifically, can you give us an idea of the foot traffic at the 40 training locations from physicians? And are you expecting a conversion rate of one-to-one from those physicians to full total knee implanters? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So no real difference in our commentary as it relates to our mix of businesses and hospital volumes. Everything feels and looks very stable, and you can see that with the organic number that we delivered, even adjusting for the extra selling day. Our capital businesses really don't have any impact, whether it's an extra selling day or one less selling day. It really doesn't impact those businesses. And then in terms of the conversion, if I'm understanding the question correctly, do you mean in terms of if there's a robot out there, are they converting to TKA for an upgrade? The vast majority of the robots installed in the field we believe will be upgraded to a total knee. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I think \u2013 but if your question was more related to people who are going to one of our training sites, if they have enough of an interest to go to a cadaver training or to go to our training sites, we do believe it's going to be a very high hit rate, because to get to that point, they will already have a certain level of interest. And basically, what we should, what we felt at the academy, once they start to understand what MAKO really gives them, we believe the conversion rate is going to be very high because a lot of people had a preconceived idea that they're really just getting some kind of automatic saw. And yes, the saw blade is one of the features of the robot, but it's clearly not the most impactful part of it. It's really about how you can balance the knee and make intra-operative adjustments and be able to do recuts. And there's all these other features that surgeons really didn't understand. So even those that have been surveyed in the past were expressing their feedback based on some idea of what MAKO was. And what was great about the academy meeting was they were able to really understand the full value of what of it delivers. So if that question around conversion rate, we do expect if they're going to go to one of these training sites for a visitation or go to a cadaver lab, we expect a very high conversion rate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to just first ask about MAKO. And at AAOS, we heard about some competitive offerings. Smith & Nephew launched their total knee. You had Zimmer who announced ambitions to get into robotics. I'm just wondering if since AAOS, if you could characterize any \u2013 how the conversations have changed with any prospective customers or anyone that's considering a robot in light of some of these other solutions, and if you could comment at all on the competitive landscape in total joint robotics. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Rich. I appreciate the question. I would say the conversation hasn't changed at all. We remain focused on launching our total knee. We believe the features and benefits of our robot and where we are in both the installed base in the field and actively doing upgrades for an existing application where we've been able to demonstrate the benefits and features of it is a pretty powerful conversation. We've talked about over 40% of the robots installed going to competitive accounts, and that continues to be the trend. So there's been no change in the conversation. Really, it's focused around what MAKO can do as opposed to background noise about competitive offerings that may or may not come to market. Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, great. And then just to follow up here on trauma, some of the smaller spine competitors are starting to get into or have ambitions to get into trauma. I was just wondering, what can you comment on within that industry? Your growth has been holding pretty steady. It feels like it's a pretty attractive overall market. But are there any trends there that you think could lead to increased competition? And if you were to see more players coming in, why or how is Stryker potentially positioned to fend that off? Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I think trauma is a little bit different than if you look at, say, Spine. And the reason I think it's different is you really need to have a full offering. You need to have a full offering of plates. You need to have a full offering of nails. You need to have a complete offering if you want to take over an entire account or even to really thrive in a Level 1 trauma center. That was our learning. If you remember, for a long time Synthes was the dominant player in trauma. Everybody else was a distant second. And until we rounded out our full portfolio, that's really \u2013 once we finished rounding out the portfolio, that's when we really started to take off in our growth about four years ago. So will some competitors be able to nibble around a little bit here and there with some business? Sure, but to be a real meaningful player, having that full portfolio is extremely important. I think that makes trauma a little bit different than some of the other specialties. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Craig William Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. It's actually Craig on for Larry. Kevin, I wanted to start with you. And we've seen a number of large deals in MedTech over the last couple of years. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on potential consolidation within the space, and if there are any competitive dynamics or the environment that may be driving more of a consolidation of some of the subsectors under a bigger company. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So what I'd say is that we remain committed to our current strategy, which is to drive category leadership in the segments that we are currently playing in. And we're going to continue to do this through a combination of internal innovation as well as acquisitions. As you've seen, this strategy is serving us really well, and we expect it will continue to serve us well going into the future. Craig William Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask about when will the results of the DAWN clinical trial be presented? Will it be at the European Stroke Meeting in May, which I think is the next big meeting? And what impact do you think the results could have on growth of the ischemic market? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, it will be at the May meeting in Europe where we'll see the results will be presented. I think it certainly affirms the opportunity here by widening the treatment window, which is obviously one of the challenges with this ischemic patient population. But there's still work to be done in terms of building the market awareness, the referral channel, all the points along the treatment paradigm that will take a number of years to really fully realize. So it's great when we've got the clinical data to support it, but there's a lot of market development work. That's not new. We've talked about this before, but obviously this type of clinical data helps to drive that process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaila Krum from William Blair. Your line is open. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. When you think about the spinal implant market, and you're obviously focusing on Tritanium and 3D printing there. But can you talk a little bit more about what inning we're in with those technologies and what's next as far as your R&D pipeline in Spine? I guess specifically, do you see more value in investing in robotics technologies in Spine, or are you drawn more towards innovating the implant, either through development or acquisition of a motion preservation disk or expanding the Tritanium platform? I was just trying to understand the long-term vision there. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. So for Stryker, I would tell you that we're in the early stages with Tritanium, very early stages. And we believe that it's going to have broader application. We've had terrific success. We have a claim that it promotes bone-in growth, which is a really powerful claim with Tritanium. So I would say its early innings. And certainly we only had one product that did very, very well last year. We're launching more products this year. So I think we're in the early innings of Tritanium. With respect to the rest of our portfolio, I'm not going to get into specifically which products that we have in development. We do have an active R&D pipeline. And clearly, the areas of less invasive surgery, biologics, those are the areas that clearly have the most potential. But I'm not going to get into specifics about which specific areas we're going to focus on, at least not at this point. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, that's fair. And then I guess just as a follow-up, some of your Spine competitors have commented that volumes were a bit slower in Spine in January and February of this year, and then they saw a pickup in March. It doesn't sound like that's something that you're seeing broadly in your business, but is that something that you've seen in the Spine segment specifically? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: We really have stayed away from commenting on month-to-month trends. We haven't found it to be really a good barometer of how a quarter or quarters play out. So we're probably not going to get to that level of detail. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Williams from D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management): Thanks for your time. I just had a question on the CapEx spend through the year. I see a little bit of a pickup this year versus Q1 last year. I believe it was in the guidance that 2017 is going to be at $450 million. Is that still what you guys are looking at for this year? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Brent, we're still targeting that number. CapEx includes spending related to ERP and other systems as well as facilities. And as Kevin mentioned, we are spending a fair amount on new 3D printing equipment. So those are the broad categories in there, but we're still targeting the number that we guided to. Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management): Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2017 results will be held on July 27. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, who will discuss our pending acquisition of NOVADAQ and an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. Our momentum continued in Q2 as we delivered organic sales growth of 6.7% in spite of one less selling day, which impacted total sales by approximately one percentage point of growth. All of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, delivered strong top-line gains and growth was well balanced graphically with organic growth of 7.2% in the U.S. and 5.5% in international. We continue to be pleased with our results in Europe and Canada with our Transatlantic Operating Model. Our first-half results reinforced the strength of our product portfolio, commercial execution and globalization effort. This has enabled us to exceed our original sales and earnings targets and is reflected in today's revised financial outlook for the year. We continue to deliver on our goal of achieving organic revenue growth at the high-end of medtech as we are gaining market share across the majority of our division and we continue to make investments to help drive growth longer term, while still delivering leveraged earning gains. The strong top-line and operating margin expansion contributed to an adjusted per share earnings increase of approximately 10%, topping the high-end of our range at $1.53 per share. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are excited about the pending acquisition of NOVADAQ, which will add a key growth driver to our high-performing Endoscopy division. And despite the product challenges that we have had with Physio-Control and Sage, the latter of which we recently received a warning letter related to last year's recall, we remain on track with the EPS accretion for both deals as their growth will accelerate through the remainder of the year. Our full-year organic sales growth is now targeted at 6.5% to 7% and EPS of $6.45 to $6.55 per share. This excludes dilution from the NOVADAQ acquisition that Glenn will cover in his section. I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on the recently-announced plans to acquire NOVADAQ, along with an update on Mako and the Total Knee launch. Starting with NOVADAQ, as you know, in June, we announced the planned acquisition for approximately $701 million, net of cash totaling roughly $47 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood vessels and related tissue perfusion in a variety of procedures, including cardiac, general, colon and plastic surgery. The company, which is headquartered in Canada and was founded in 2000, aligns with Stryker's focus on enabling our customers to see and do more by enhancing cross-specialty surgical visualization. NOVADAQ's technology uniquely complements our portfolio of visualization technologies and will allow us to further build upon the highly successful launch of our latest generation 1588 Camera by expanding into new surgical procedures, including open surgery where we do not currently compete. Further, we believe NOVADAQ's SPY technology will help reduce post-procedure complication rates as well as the cost of care for a broad variety of surgical treatments. With our specialized sales force, we will be able to broaden the reach of NOVADAQ's technology as we look to leverage our highly complementary customer bases. We expect to close the transaction during the third quarter Turning to Mako, during the quarter, we installed a total of 26 Mako robots globally, an increase of over 50% year-over-year and reflecting 20 new robots in the U.S. Of note, we continue to see solid uptake for Mako upgrades, which remain on track and should position us to largely compete (05:37) all U.S. system upgrades during 2018. With respect to the new robot placement, approximately 40% continue to go into competitive accounts, where we have no to well below our normal market share. These placements are helping to drive our overall knee sales as our surgeons begin to use Triathlon Total Knee System in anticipation of Mako adoption. Moreover, we are able to introduce our broader knee portfolio to these new customers, including our highly successful 3D-printed tibial base plate and revision augments. Training on the Mako Total Knee continues at a solid pace with over 400 surgeons trained to-date, helping to drive Mako Total Knee surgery since launch to over 5,000. We are particularly pleased as we look at utilization rates, which have increased meaningfully for the Mako Total Knee, as well as the total hip application and is supporting the growth we are seeing in both franchises. On the clinical front, we are continuing to collect data comparing the Mako Total Knee to a traditional knee surgery, both utilizing Triathlon. These studies are looking at a number of standard outcome measurements, including hospital stay, return to work, range of motion, stability, discharge to rehab and patient satisfaction. We expect to begin to see some of the data at key orthopedic conferences starting in 2018 and beyond as we track these patients over time. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we have strong order demand and continue to see mounting clinical interest. We believe this will help drive ongoing knee market share gains in 2018 and beyond. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. My comments today will be focused on our second quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. The detailed financial data and results have been included in today' press release. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 6.7%. As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, which has the impact of reducing growth by roughly 1%. As previously stated, selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.5% from the prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 0.8% on sales. In the U.S., we continue to see good momentum with organic sales growth of 7.2%. This strong growth was evident throughout several of our key divisions within our Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment. International organic sales growth of 5.5% was highlighted by solid performances in Europe and Australia. Our growth in emerging markets continues to recover, but also benefited from favorable year-over-year comparable. Both geographies were impacted by one less selling day. Our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53 increased 10.1% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions, operating expense control and the previously discussed benefit from the change in accounting guidance for tax benefits from certain stock compensation expenses now included in our tax provision. Our second-quarter EPS, as anticipated, was negatively impacted $0.04 by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 6.5% and organic growth of 6.2%, including organic growth of 8.4% in the U.S. Our U.S. performance was highlighted by growth in knees of 7% and trauma and extremities at 10%, reflecting strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our foot and ankle portfolio and our Triathlon knee. Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 1.8% and included steady performances across all developed markets. MedSurg continued to have strong results in the quarter with constant currency growth of 6.8% and organic gains of 6.7%, which included a 6.9% increase in the U.S. instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.2%. During the quarter, instruments executed its sampling plan for its newly launched System 8 drill and began several customer trials. We expect System 8 shipments will gain momentum into the third and fourth quarters as we have now shifted to full commercial launch. Endoscopy had another strong quarter with U.S. organic sales of 15.2%. This reflects continued strong demand for our 1588 video platform, booms and lights and sports medicine products. Medical had U.S. organic growth of 2.3%. This growth primarily reflects the impact related to the timing of shipments of our core bed, stretcher and power cot products. As you are aware, our core medical business is all capital and can be impacted by the timing of customer orders and the related shipment. We continue to see strong order growth in the core medical business. Our Sage business momentum improved during the quarter, following the previously discussed product recall. We are actively regaining customers that had switched during the recall and we are seeing solid performances in the other key products in the Sage portfolio. Subsequent to quarter-end, Sage received an FDA warning letter, which relates to an inspection last September shortly after we closed on the acquisition. We have already taken many steps to address the items outlined in the warning letter and will continue to work with the FDA toward resolution. This year's (11:04) results were impacted by continued supplier issues took earlier in the quarter in a tough quarterly comparable. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 6%, which reflects strong Canadian, Australian sales and an easing of the metrics comparables in China. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 7.9%. We continue to see strong global demand for our Neurotech products, which is somewhat offset by softness in our Spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 10.3% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products, CMF products and our neuro-powered instruments. Our U.S. Spine business continued to see softness as it recovers from supply issues early in the year, partly offset by high demand for our 3D-printed titanium products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.1%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Now, I'll focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was up 10 basis points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting a favorable mix, offset primarily by price and foreign exchange related to certain businesses. R&D spending was 6.4% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was up 10 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This reflects favorable leverage from business mix and continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth program. This favorability was offset by planned investments in our selling organization, including samples and sales rep adds, our CTG program, including our ERP implementation, and continued investments in our Mako TKA platform. In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.3% of sales, which was flat compared to prior-year quarter. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 25% of sales and 20 basis points better than the prior-year quarter. Our operating margin reflects good leverage, offset by key investments related to drive future operational savings and product growth platforms. We continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver our full-year commitment of 30 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin. Lastly, as it relates to our full-year operating margin improvement, NOVADAQ is anticipated to be approximately 20 basis point dilutive to our operating margin for 2017, which would partially offset the expected 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement. Now, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other income/expense decreased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to increased interest income. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses. In the second half of the year, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated effective tax rate ranging from 16% to 17%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities; of which, approximately 89% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $801 million. Also, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. And now, I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance. Based on our past performance on our outlook for the remainder for the year, we now anticipate annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017. As a reminder, the third quarter will have one less selling day as compared to 2016 and the fourth quarter will have the same number of selling days. The full year has one less selling day. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the third quarter and full year to be negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be negatively impacted by $0.02 in the third quarter and approximately $0.10 in the full year. For 2017, our adjusted net earnings per diluted share is now expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.55 per share, which excludes any anticipated dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ technologies. Based on the third quarter-end close date for NOVADAQ, the dilution is estimated to be approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share. For the third quarter, we anticipate that adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55, which includes the aforementioned investment, foreign currency impact and the impact of the accounting change for stock compensation. Our third quarter range does not assume any dilution related to NOVADAQ. However, if the deal closes earlier than September 30, there will be additional dilution during the quarter. And now, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first call comes from the line Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. You may proceed. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon and first off congratulations on another excellent quarter. Let me start with Mako, because I imagine it's probably topic one for people. Could you just talk a little bit about the upgrade process? I think when we last spoke probably on the topic, you had a pretty good backlog of centers requesting upgrades to existing systems. Could you give us a sense for what that backlog looks like today? And talk a little bit about kind of the obstacle, if you would, to installs and upgrades over the balance of the year. Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, Mike, thank you. And in terms of the upgrade process, we're really pleased with the pace of it. I think, as you know, the sales force is having to both sell new robots while also upgrading existing customers and we have a pretty sizable number of robots in the field. And based on how that's tracking, we feel comfortable, we'll be through that process next year. I think the biggest gating item right now is our ability to identify, hire and train the Mako specialists, who are critical to ensuring that not just the surgeon, but his entire OR staff is prepared to have a really successful experience as they start to adopt the Mako robot. So, that's really one of the key factors that we're continuing to hire those folks, who are probably looking right now if you wanted a total Mako knee robot today, the issue isn't us being able to build and get you a robot, the issue is getting you in the queue and getting you trained and through that process as we hire additional Mako specialists. So, you're probably looking at something late in Q4 before you are able actually to be in a position where you had it and you were good to go. So, that's not unexpected for us. That's why we really talked about this very methodical launch and we're really pleased with the pace of that that we're seeing right now. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, essentially this is a five-month waiting period, if you would, if you ordered one today? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Roughly, approximately. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: That really depends, Mike, on where you're located in the country, if you already have a MAKOplasty specialist. So, that's sort of an average. It does vary based on where you are in the country and where the MAKOplasty specialists are. But our team is working very hard. We're obviously investing and Glenn talked about that in the first quarter and again this quarter. We are prioritizing investment to make sure that the waiting list is not too long for our customers and that we're pacing things appropriately. But so far, extremely pleased. Most importantly, the people who are using the total knee, the over 400 surgeons are having a very good experience and were getting very favorable feedback on the performance of the system. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And let me ask this if I could about two other businesses and then I'll let some others jump in. One, the Endoscopy business is obviously having a phenomenal year. It's year two of the launch. If you could just kind of update us on kind of where you think you are in this upgrade cycle for that business. Obviously, very strong first half of this year. And then, second, your U.S. spine business was a little light this quarter and one of your competitors announced a light quarter this evening as well. We had a number of data points kind of suggesting that the spine market was light, not only in the first quarter, but here in the second quarter as well. So, if you have any perspective on what's going on in the U.S. spine market, that'd be appreciated. Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Mike. I'll take the Endoscopy question and I'll turn it to Katherine for spine. So, certainly the Endoscopy division is really performing well. I would say that the camera launches \u2013 year two we've always said is kind of the year where rib things (20:32) really pick up. We had a good year last year and even better year this year, but I would say they're firing on all three cylinders. So it's not just about the camera. The booms and lights are also doing extremely well in our communications business. And sports medicine, which is obviously a smaller business, is absolutely on fire. So, that business has been growing strong double-digits for a number of years, continues to outpace the market and we've done some very good small acquisitions, whether it's pivot for hip arthroscopy or recently Ivy Sports Medicine. These acquisitions are helping to contribute to a really strong growth. So, across the board the business is being very, very well managed and that gives me a lot of excitement as we do NOVADAQ to really add gas to the fire of Endoscopy. And I'll turn it to Katherine for spine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Kevin got endo and I get spine. So, I think it's safe to say we still -we have some challenges there and I think also based on some of the numbers have come in, the market overall looks to be challenged certainly in this quarter. We've had some Stryker issues as we work through some of the supply challenges, but on the positive front, those do appear to be moderating for us. And we're also seeing really strong demand, but we are capacity constrained for our Tritanium products. And so, we're going to continue to invest in that portfolio. We have a number of products in the R&D queue for that area. And so, over the longer term, we expect to see an improvement, but clearly it's been a little bit more challenging for us both due to some of our issues, but also a market that just seems to be a little bit softer than expected in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. You may proceed. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, we can. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good afternoon. So, two questions; first one on clarifying guidance and then one on Mako. On the guidance question, I just want to clarify that the new EPS guidance excludes NOVADAQ dilution. And then, I also was wondering if you could just kind of clarify the new revenue growth guidance as well. Is the right way to think about it essentially that the back-half guidance or the back-half growth is going to essentially be very similar to the front half growth? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes. Bob, in terms of guidance, the $6.45 to $6.55 per share excludes any dilution from the NOVADAQ transaction. And in terms of revenue guidance, yeah, I think if you think about the back half of the year, it probably will continue at a similar pace as the first half of the year. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, the second question I wanted to ask was on Mako. It looks like you had a fantastic quarter in terms of training physicians relative to comments that you offered us on the last quarter. So, I know you're giving us information on the percentage of placements that are going into competitive accounts, but one thing that I'm really interested in is of the people that you're training right now, these roughly 200 docs it looks like that you trained in the quarter, what percentage of those physicians are \"competitive physicians?\" Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Well, it's going to largely mirror. We're training the competitive surgeons, because as we put a robot in, they need to get trained on it. And what you're also seeing reflected in our knee numbers, Bob, is as they get a new robot, one of the first steps if they are a competitive account and they haven't any real experience often with Triathlon as they start doing traditional knee procedures, traditional open knee procedures, but now using Triathlon to start to get used to that product. So, that's some of the halo effect we referenced. But as we start to train surgeons, by definition, as we're putting roughly 40% of the robots into new customers, we're going to have \u2013 I don't think it mirrors 100%, but it's going to be a good approximation of who is getting trained. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Just one strategic one for Kevin and a couple of just quick hits. So, Kevin, the growth is stellar, but I want to bring us back to the Analyst Day and the now infamous 9% EPS floor comment, if you would. So, you're certainly delivering above the floor. There's no question about that, but you're also reinvesting very aggressively for growth. So, could you just speak to the level of reinvestment for those investors who may expect more EPS drop-through on these very lofty organic growth rates? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, David, thanks for the question. And certainly we did raise the EPS as well as raising our top-line. So, I just want to make sure you saw that, but clearly, if we're in a momentum where we're gaining on the top-line, we'll always look to do some level of reinvestment. We have committed to improving our operating margin as well. So, there isn't a one-for-one like that you used to see maybe in the past where we would deliver more top-line and spend at an even more aggressive rate. But we have this generational opportunity with Mako, where we're going to use some opportunity to invest behind that and also have a responsible level of drop-through. If the reverse occurred and our sales growth slowed, you would certainly expect us to dial down the expenses. And so, we're being prudent about it, but we have raised our EPS guidance, I think, to an appropriate level. And we'll continue to fuel. I mean, we have an offense that's been really rolling for the past four years and I think what you've seen in the last two years is really good EPS drop-through. And some of that's come through tax, obviously, but a lot of that's coming through our operations. So, I think you should continue to expect if the top-line continues to run hot that we will take a portion to reinvest and, obviously, drop through the remainder. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very clear. And just two quick ones from me. Glenn, just the components of the $0.10 raise, the components there that are FX and the tax suppression from stock-based comp. And then, Katherine, just on the instruments business, the only business we saw that had kind of momentum was a little weaker. Obviously, that business tends to bounce around, but anything instruments that's important to call out? Thanks so much. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yes. On the component of the raise, FX is moderating. So, it won't be as big as it was in the first half. I think in the first half, we probably had around $0.08 per share, if you look at what we had. I'm guessing that it will be about $0.05 or so in the back half. No, not $0.05, probably $0.02 in the back half. And then, in terms of the components of the tax, I think in addition to the stock comp, we also implemented some other changes geographically that will benefit us in the back half of the year and that's probably roughly a 0.5% point on our tax rate. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, but the way to think about it, David, is we had said in the last quarter $0.10 to $0.12 was FX. Now, Glenn saying about 10%, so \u2013 $0.10. So pretty modest amount from FX and that, obviously, could change if exchange rates change. Obviously, we've had a pretty rapid appreciation of the euro recently and we're using today's FX rates for that. So it's pretty modest, the FX impact. We also don't have a lot of business OUS as some of our competitors do. And then, if you look at the rest, it's really mostly operational. Again, there's a little bit of tax, but mostly operational. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah and then just on your question on instruments and the U.S. performance, I think the main focus for the team in the quarter was the System 8 launch and it was really about getting the sampling plan in place and beginning some of the customer trials. Obviously, there's not a big revenue generation associated with that. We're now in full commercial launch. So, we feel pretty excited based on our history of launching next-generation power tools and understanding that upgrade cycle to see an acceleration in that business in the second half as we move away from the sampling stage. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. You may proceed. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Let's talk a little bit more about the different components of the medical business this quarter, what the growth rates were for Sage, Physio and then the legacy Stryker product lines. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Now that they are fully in the business post one-year acquisition, we don't break those out anymore just because they're not material to the total company. So, we typically if it's of size give the growth rates for newly acquired business through the first year, after which we consider it to be part of organic growth. We did see improvement in those businesses per se. Did they start to recapture business that they lost due to some of the recall challenges and also for Physio recognizing that they are having some supplier disruption? So feel confident that there's no change to the full-year EPS accretion, associated those deals that we originally announced and also feel confident that we'll continue to see quarter-to-quarter improvement in those businesses as they work through some of those challenges associated with those deals. But we're not going to break out with specificity as we did through the first four quarters nor do we with other deals that after we announce them. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe \u2013 yeah, go ahead, Kevin Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Just a little extra color. So our legacy medical business, the core medical business of beds and stretchers and cots as you may remember had a huge quarter in the second quarter last year, about 17% growth. And they have very, very good orders, but didn't have a very strong shipment quarter. And what we've seen in the past with our medical business is it's a bit more volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but the order book is really strong. So although the medical number is a little soft this quarter, the outlook for the medical division is very strong not only for the remainder of this year but for the future. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks for that. And can you spend a minute on the competitive landscape in recon at the moment? By our math, you picked up some solid share again this quarter, particularly in the U.S., and you've really been enjoying that momentum now for the last four quarters or so, even pre-dating some of this recent strength with Mako. So, how much of that momentum that you've had do you think is related to sort of product-specific things that you guys have been doing versus maybe some competitors who have been in a tougher spot? And do you expect to keep that share as they get back on their feet? Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thank you for the question. I would tell you that we're focused on executing on a strategy that's been underway for a couple of years now. So, it's nothing new in terms of really having highly focused sales force that we're continuing to make investments in as we talk about making investments to drive longer-term growth. That's part of it. We also have seen real uptake over the last X number of quarters from our new product portfolio and the investments we made over the years in 3D printing to be able to give us some really unique product offering that if you look at our cementless offering is now approaching, 20% of our knees are now cementless, which is vastly different than to the overall market, which is still in the low-single digits. And we talk about that Mako halo effect to be able to go in and sell the full portfolio of our knee and hip products when we get into competitive accounts is certainly helping to drive the growth. So, we're gaining market shares in knees as we have been. We feel like we're holding our own in hips, but also are pleased with some of the impact. Our renewed focus there is having \u2013 and expect that business to continue to improve. So, it's really difficult to slice out where all the share is coming from, but we feel confident in our ability to continue to execute on the strategy that's been working really well for us over the last few years. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. You may proceed. Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. Kevin, maybe talk to us about where you are in China these days. You had easier comps. That was good. Just maybe some more color on the underlying business growth and what's still left to do from an investment point of view. Just your latest thoughts there. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, China had a good quarter, double-digit growth in the quarter. But I would say that's more to do with the comparatives than really having a big and strong business in China. As you know, we had a couple years of difficulties in China. We're starting to right the ship. I'm feeling encouraged by the progress that we're making, but we have a long way to go still. We are looking to appoint a new leader in China. That search process is progressing. Obviously a very important role for the future of our business in China. We're also doing a lot of work with our Trauson portfolio as well, both for inside of China as well as for export. I would say it's still early days, Rick. We still have a long way to go. I'm glad that it's no longer a headwind for the company and having double-digit growth in China is certainly a positive. But certainly given our low market share, the potential is enormous and we are just starting to tap into that potential. So many, many more years to come of progress, but it starts with talent and we don't yet have our new China leader, but we're getting close. Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. And, Katherine, maybe back on NOVADAQ, you highlighted a couple things, open surgery where you don't compete is an opportunity, it seems like connected to Endoscopy, but maybe just add a little bit more color if you could about what you can do with NOVADAQ in your hands that can accelerate growth and the opportunity and if you just expand on some of your comments. Thanks so much. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I think the biggest benefit to us is they have outstanding technology that gives us access to new procedures for a customer base that we call on and we have commercial sales execution that's been built up over decades. We have a considerably larger sales footprint and the expertise to be able to sell these products effectively to gain access to new accounts where we already have a presence and to be able to sell our portfolio into customers where they have a presence. So I think it's a really nice marriage of commercial excellence, our own very well accepted in the market visualization technologies and then bringing in what is very complementary visualization technologies to expand the customer base and the procedure that we can address. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic of UBS. You may proceed. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And just one follow-up on Mako, I'd love to get a sense, if you could provide some sense of the types of hospitals that you're seeing the most active in new system placements? So mid-size hospitals, urban hospitals, any smaller centers, privately held hospitals? Just a couple of examples would be very helpful and then I have one follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, thanks. It's really all of the above. The way we have gone about the launch of this, which has proven to be very successful, is focusing on where we have a very strong surgeon champion and that's what's really helping to ensure that the adoption in utilization of the robot continues to accelerate and that includes urban, it includes rural, it's big practices, it's small practices. There is no single specific type of Mako customer. It really covers the entire landscape that you described. And that's where we focused our activities, first and foremost is there a surgeon champion, and are they committed to the process and that's what really drives both the adoption in the hospital and then the utilization rates afterwards. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. And then same topic, just trying to get a sense of what the sales cycle of the system is like. As you know, one of your competitors is out sort of talking about having a robot in the future. I'm just wondering if in this environment, whether it's just the health care environment in general or if it's any actions that your competitors have taken have like extended the sales cycle or tightened it or what do you see in terms of just the pace of new placements? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I'm assuming you're referring to Mako, specifically? Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, so, no, we haven't seen any impact. This is really about identifying surgeon champions and then when our team goes in and does a terrific job of detailing the features and benefits and as they get exposure to it, whether it's events like the Academy meeting we had or another surgeon in their hospital who is using the robot, all of those lead to that word of mouth and mounting interest as they start to hear more about the experience from the key opinion leaders. So there's been no impact we've seen, whether it's from hospital spending or competitive movements. We're just really focused on what has been a really successful launch as we went from initial launch now to full commercial launch. We're ramping up the number of surgeons trained at 400. We've got over 5,000 procedures. Obviously that continues to grow quarter-to-quarter. We're upgrading the existing robots as well as selling new robots. So really focused on a game plan that seems to be working very well for us. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And if we have a surgeon that's really interested in the champion in a hospital that gets behind the surgeon, to us, we welcome the competition. We really believe we have a winning solution and so if there is something competitive that resembles our offering or that even purports to resemble our offering, we sort of welcome that challenge and look forward to it. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. You may proceed. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Kevin or Katherine, I guess, you've rolled Mako out very carefully to ensure quality outcomes. And I'm sure you have a sense now of the short-term outcomes that are attainable in terms of range of motion, pain, stability, discharge to institutional rehab. Do you feel that the results that you'll formally publish in the next year or so will be compelling enough to make surgeons feel that they're actually doing their patients a disservice for not using robotically-assisted implants? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I think we're still in a wait and see. We are collecting that data right now, so it'd be premature to get out in front and make claims until we actually have sufficient data collected. We've got a number of centers collecting data, as I mentioned, comparing Triathlon on the robot to traditional Triathlon and looking at some very standard follow-up measurements that would speak to some of your comments. But until that data is collected, we have follow-up, we crunch the data, we submit it to the different meetings, it would be premature to get in front of it. We're really pleased with anecdotal feedback, but that's anecdotal and I don't want to start to make speculation about what the clinical data would look like, other than to say we're committed to collecting the data and continue to believe that this will have a positive impact on patient and customer experience. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And I guess just going back to Sage and Physio, my recollection was, just on a directional basis, you felt Sage or Physio, rather, could sustainably grow in the high-single digits for a period and that Sage had double-digit potential. And I know you're not going to break things out any longer, but are those aspirational goals still intact? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, certainly this is not what occurred in the second quarter. But in terms of over the long term, we absolutely still remain committed to those kinds of goals and we see that in the pipeline of the products and in the teams that we have out there. So these are very good businesses. We are very pleased to have acquired them. They didn't have those kinds of numbers in the second quarter, but we do see that as a resumption of the pipeline within Physio and as Sage gets the recall behind us, we absolutely see those kinds of numbers going forward. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on ischemic stroke, one on Mako. You called out the strength in your ischemic stroke business earlier and the Neurotech growth was quite healthy this quarter. So I guess my question is have we already started seeing an impact from the DAWN trial and what's the timing of the publication? And I had one follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, it's really difficult to point to a single factor and that was relatively recently. I will say, we saw solid growth both in ischemic as well as hemorrhagic in the quarter. So, really pleased with the performance on both sides. I don't have an update on the timing for publication of the DAWN data. I think you really have to look at all of those factors, DAWN and some of the previous studies that have come out, that are contributing to the interest in ischemic treatments that are mechanical based. There's still a lot of work that has to be done on the referral channel as we've talked about. So, I think that's a business that we expect, overall, very healthy growth, but it's going to vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of some of these studies as well as the investments that we and our competitors are making to really help build the referral channel, which is going to be a multiyear process. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And then, on Mako, Katherine, I didn't hear the total number of applications out there. I think there were 90 at the end of first quarter. Can you give us an update on that? And do you still expect to exit the year taking share? You're already growing, I think, your knee business in the high-single digits. Can that really improve from here? Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Sure. No problem. So, we give the new robot installations that we've done. We have not reported any numbers on upgrades other than to say that we're pleased with the pace and we're on track to have the upgrades of all of the robots in the U.S. or the vast majority that will be upgraded in 2018. But we haven't broken out specific numbers on the upgrades. And then your second question? I apologize. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Continued knee growth. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Oh, the knee growth, so, yes, we continue to believe that as we get more surgeons trained and the base of those doing the procedure will allow us to drive stronger knee market share as we exit 2017. So, I think you should kind of think about a rolling four-quarter knee growth and that's kind of the base we assume we'll improve upon as we get further into the full commercial launch and we think the first evidence of that will be as we exit 2017. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First question was on margins. Would be interested in a status update regarding some of the goals you have to increase capacity across your manufacturing locations as part of the long-term goal to drive margins and then also any status update on your global ERP program. I know that you're working on eventually consolidating that and so I'd be interested in some of the key milestones we can expect there over the next 12 months or so. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, Isaac, we outlined the program back at our Analyst Meeting and it was a five-year kind of program. We actually have made very good progress relative to our product life cycle management, which is what I think you're referring to, which is really a SKU rationalization program that we're putting in place to sort of harmonize what versions of products we sell across multiple geographies. And so, we're in year two of that plan and it's a multi-year implementation. So, we're not necessarily seeing results, but we are making good progress on the implementation. And then, related to our ERP program, this too was a four-year program where we're putting in SAP globally. We're also rolling out global processes, which will help us become more efficient in terms of how we manage the various financial functions across the world. Relative to that project, obviously, you can imagine that's a very big project. We've seen really good progress on the systems side and the business side and we expect sometime within the next six months to have our initial implementation and rollout of the first wave of that. And then, upon the successful wave of that, we'll continue with rollouts across various businesses until we complete all the businesses across the globe. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. So, maybe as a follow-up, if I interpret your comments there correctly, is it fair to say that we'll see some of the results of those efforts translated into the P&L early 2018 or could be later in the year? Just trying to think through timing of when this becomes a little more tangible on the bottom line. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, I really think it's later in 2018, second half, fourth quarter 2018 before we start to see some of the meaningful results of that work. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: And as we laid out with cost transformation, we did say 30 basis points to 50 basis points over the next few years. In the early years, it will be closer to 30 basis points. There are some elements like indirect procurement, shared services where we'll get savings earlier. The areas like the ERP systems and product life cycle management will drive much higher savings in the outer years, but it's a multi-year multi-facetted program. It's working so far and we're getting some early returns at least as it relates to indirect procurement. But the bigger prize will come with product lifecycle management and as you mentioned with ERP, which will begin sort of towards the end of 2018 and continue in the years after that. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum of William Blair. You may proceed. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple from me. So, I guess, as it relates to the NOVADAQ deal, just a bit more color around kind of initial goals, steps for integration there once the deal does close. What sort of feedback or initial excitement have you been hearing from your sales force there? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, the sales force is extremely excited. This is a highly complementary technology. It expands their customer base. It allows them to further leverage the expertise we have with our own visualization technologies and it's a sell process that they understand. So, there's a lot of excitement. I think we've got to get to closing before we start to really articulate some of our plans, but, obviously, we anticipate a lot of synergies to be realized given how complementary this business is. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And, Kaila, I'd just add that as surgeons, if you think about the top KOLs within the Sage's group of surgeons, I've received numerous calls directly from surgeons in that leading association who were really excited, because they see this combination as very, very powerful for them. So, when a customer gets excited about the combination of competencies, that's always a good indicator that we're going to have commercial success. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just touching on your foot and ankle business, has there been any update there as it relates to market trends, your competitive stance? Any additional color there would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, so this has been a great business for us, as you know, for probably five years now. And we've had terrific success whether it's with our total ankle as well as Anchorage plates. We did an acquisition a little while ago called Instratek, which also fortified that business and that deal is going extremely well. So, the offense that we have with our dedicated sales force that we put in place a number of years ago, our really good leadership and our product portfolio, we're in a great position, we're growing much faster than the market and have been for some time and we expect that to continue. The beauty of this market is it's a growth market. So you're having implants put in where they weren't put in before and just like ischemic stroke is for neurovascular, that's what foot and ankle is to our trauma and extremities business. An expanding market and continuing to grow at very, very strong double digits. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclays. You may proceed. Young Li - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Young Li in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess the first question just on the warning letter, can you maybe talk about any early feedback you've been getting from the FDA so far? Since you've not really changed any deal assumptions, what gives you the confidence that the warning letter won't become a more disruptive issue? And are there any impacts on new product approvals or would it impact any other manufacturing facilities? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks for the question. I will tell you that this was an inspection that happened shortly after we closed the deal. We have been addressing with the FDA a number of the issues that were raised in the warning letter. And we obviously take this very seriously and will continue to dialogue with them to resolve the outstanding issues. There are no product holds related with this warning letter nor does it impact other parts of the business. So, we're highly focused on addressing their concerns and we'll continue to provide you updates as we work through some of the items that have been outlined in what were three observations in this warning letter. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, so what I would say is, it did disrupt our business to some degree. That disruption is now over, as Katherine mentioned, no longer a ship hold, I would say the business is sort of back to business in a very normal way. Obviously we do need to finish our remediation efforts, but it's not requiring any significant amount of investment and the business is sort of back on track. Young Li - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. And I guess a follow-up on the foot and ankle market, but just wondering with the positive CMS reimbursement update for total ankles, can you maybe talk about what that could mean for your business? Is there any ability to take up price? And also I guess how important is having a revision ankle in your portfolio? How impactful could that be? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, obviously we're very pleased with the change in reimbursement. I would tell you that we were getting pretty good price all along and so I'm not sure that there's going to be a significant opportunity to increase price. But what the lower reimbursement was doing was dampening the momentum in the market. It was a very small part of the market and we think now that this will unlock growth for the entire market. So, all competitors will be able to increase growth. I think revision is something that we'll obviously be looking at for the future. It's still a very nascent market. So, I don't believe that that's a major concern within our portfolio. You've seen our growth. We're able to grow at very high rates without a revision offering, but that's obviously something that we'll address over time. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen. You may proceed. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Kevin, do you think Stryker is experiencing a benefit from opportunities in competitive accounts or have your team's been able to hire away high-quality sales reps due to your competitors supply constraint issues particularly in hips and knees? And has Stryker implemented any specific strategies in the short term to take advantage of any vulnerabilities? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I tell you, Josh, I think really what you're seeing out of our joint replacement group is a focus on a strategy that has worked for us for a number of years. So we're continuing to invest in our sales force and that doesn't necessarily mean it's coming from competitive reps. We're continuing to leverage the portfolio of products that we've launched in recent years and obviously highly focused on Mako. So, to the degree there's disruption in the marketplace, obviously we're going to try and take advantage of that, but it really is a strategy that was well under way prior to anything that's been happening on the competitive front and one that we think is working well for us and we're going to continue to execute on. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I would say that we do receive a lot of inbound calls and I'm not saying that that's related directly to supply issues, but if you have an offering nobody else has with robotics or 3D printing and you have momentum in the market, well, obviously, that is felt by the sales forces competitively. So, the phones are ringing. That's a good sign. I don't believe that it's ever driven by just one thing, whether it's just a supply disruption or just one thing. And our strategy is just to continue to drive high growth and as the phone calls ring, we'll see if these people fit our culture. And if we believe that that'll be additive to our growth, then obviously we'll look to hire them. But we don't have a specific let's-go-hunt-for-sales-force plan and we don't really need to, given the kind of strength we have in the market. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. Thanks. And just one follow-up on Mako. I was just wondering if implant pricing contracting is evolving, just imagine if some of these centers are dedicating them to developing robotics program that they may be interested in locking in multiyear contracts just to do the exclusivity of the Mako platform. And the, how do you see, if you're not seeing anything in those early days, how do you see Mako helping on the implant pricing side of the equation in terms of maybe multiyear stabilization in some accounts? Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, right now, most of the implant pricing is on multi-year contracts to begin with, regardless of whether there's a Mako in the account or not. And most of the procedures are done without the use of the robot. And so, we continue to want to provide competitive pricing to our accounts and over time, with the adoption of Mako, if it becomes more broad, then obviously that will provide more insulation for us. But certainly at the moment, it's very competitive, as you see in our price decrease quarter after quarter after quarter is pretty consistent to what it has been over the past eight or nine quarters. So, it's pretty steady. It's a moderating decline, but it's still going to be a decline. And I would assume, at least for the next foreseeable future, next couple of years, that you should probably see similar types of pricing. Over time, we'll see how that evolves. Operator : Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Brittany Henderson of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Mako. I know that the focus right now is just on the U.S. total knee launch, but I was hoping you could give us an update as to the demand that you're seeing for Mako in international markets. How should we just think about the Mako opportunity internationally, especially given some of the variant reimbursement structures that we have in place overseas? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So, we're really seeing a pickup in interest internationally. Australia has been a fantastic market for us. They already did \u2013 many of their knees were done and navigated. Probably the highest percentage in the world, so they were \u2013 for them it's an easy adoption to move from navigated knees to robotic. That's been a strong market for us. But we've seen interest across a range of countries. We have a robot in China, in India, in Vietnam. Europe is starting to really pick up, which is exciting. But it's going to vary by country. So we have Germany, Italy, the U.K. Those are going to be very good markets. I think other markets such as France and Canada will take longer. So, it really is country by country and I think a good analog to look at would be Intuitive. If you think about how they expanded geographically, it was sort of very similar, which certain countries are much more friendly towards the adoption of new technology. We don't yet have any robots in Japan. We look forward to getting approval for Mako later this year. And, as you know, with Intuitive, you see that's a very attractive market for us and we look forward to being able to launch Mako in Japan. But I would say it's a broad range of countries and it's very similar, the pattern that we're seeing is a similar pattern to what Intuitive saw with their da Vinci robot. Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then, just one kind of more big picture question. I was hoping you could just talk to us a bit about your strategy and portfolio positioning in the ambulatory surgery center, especially as it relates to large joints. And I just ask that because of the recent proposed rule that we saw from CMS, which proposed total knee and total hip procedures be added to the ASC list. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. So, we already are pretty active in ASCs for our sports medicine business and we have other products that we sell into that channel. So, it's a channel that we know. Today, there's still a very small percentage of total joints that are done in the ASC. A lot of noise around it and I do believe that over time that trend will increase, but we're well prepared to win both in the in-hospital as well as in the ASC market, but I do expect that it's going to be a pretty small number at least for the next few quarters. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have very good momentum in our business and our conference call for the third-quarter 2017 will be held on October 26. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Andrew and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, who will have an update on Mako, along with comments on our recently completed acquisition of NOVADAQ and the VEXIM deal. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A. Our Q3 organic sales growth of 5.5% reflected continued strong performance, despite weather-related challenges, the previously announced Sage product issues, and one less selling day. We estimate the combined impact of Sage and weather negatively impacted our Q3 sales by approximately 240 basis points versus 2016. We benefited from standout performances in Neurotechnology, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities, and Mako, as well as double-digit growth in both our legacy Medical businesses and Physio-Control. Turning to Puerto Rico, as many of you are aware, we have a manufacturing facility on the island which produces products for our Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. We are extremely pleased with how our team has managed through this unprecedented disaster and, most importantly, we can report that we've had contact from 100% of our employees. Stryker has formed a Puerto Rico fund to aid employees specifically affected by the hurricane and is providing direct financial aid with all employee contributions matched dollar-for-dollar by the company. With respect to our customers, through the preparation and deployment of our business continuity plans, we've seen minimal disruption to product supply and do not anticipate any material financial impact going forward. The safety stock stored in our U.S. central distribution center has maintained customer supply, while we restore our manufacturing operations and supply chain. The facility is currently ramping up production, and newly manufactured goods are being shipped from the island. Against this backdrop, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the outstanding work of our Global Quality and Operations organization in Puerto Rico and around the globe in minimizing these supply disruptions. In Houston and Florida, given the impact of the hurricanes, there were canceled procedures during Q3 and some delays to capital purchases. We expect those procedures and capital purchases to be rescheduled and don't anticipate any meaningful impact to our business in Q4. Turning to Sage. In August, we announced a recall of certain products and a ship hold of other products as we switched to a new testing methodology. Encouragingly, we began shipping products during September and have now commenced shipments from all product families. We have work to do with our customers, given the disruption these events caused to their practices. Given Sage's market leadership position, which reflects the value-add of their product portfolio, we expect to regain lost market share over the coming quarters. Overall, our third quarter presented our teams with a number of unique challenges that were largely unexpected. Given the strength of our diversified portfolio, effective business continuity planning and commitment of our employees around the globe, we're able to largely meet the needs of our physician and hospital customers. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are excited about the recent acquisition of NOVADAQ and the VEXIM deal, which will help ensure we continue to deliver organic sales growth at the high end of med tech. We expect full-year organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7% and adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.50 per share, despite incurring the added dilution associated with the NOVADAQ acquisition. I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on an update on Mako, the recent NOVADAQ acquisition and the VEXIM deal announced earlier this week. Starting with Mako, during Q3, we sold a total of 33 robots, of which 23 were in the U.S., with roughly 40% in competitive accounts. We continue to update robots in the field with the Total Knee application, which now exceeds 50% of the roughly 385 robots installed in the U.S. Surgeon training on the Total Knee application is ongoing with approximately 600 trained through the third quarter, enabling 9,400 Mako Total Knee surgeries since launch. For the quarter, TKA procedures on the Mako increased approximately 50% from Q2 to approximately 4,500. And it's worth noting that total robot utilization rates continue to climb, increasing roughly 50% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. During Q3, we received 510(k) clearance for our cementless product offering to be used with the Mako Total Knee application. With approximately 20% of our total knees now being performed with our cementless offering, it's clear that there's strong surgeon interest since we first launched the product over three years ago. On the clinical front, we are building our database with a number of trials ongoing. At the upcoming (5:41) meeting in November, there will be a poster presented which focuses on the accuracy of implant sizing using Mako for total knees, with the authors concluding that Mako may reduce operative time, improve OR efficiency by reducing the need for instrumentation and potentially decrease revisions. And in October, we had our first published article on the short-term outcomes with the Mako Total Knee in the Journal of Knee Surgery. The study compared patients undergoing traditional open knee surgery with Stryker's Triathlon Knee versus Mako Total Knee surgery with Triathlon. Outcomes were measured at six months and included pain scores, physical function scores and total patient satisfaction, with all three measurements comparing statistically significantly better for patients undergoing total knee with Mako. We remain committed to continuing to invest in clinical studies and believe we are well-positioned with Mako to achieve our goal of driving meaningful market share gains. We believe this is underscored by the fact that our Total Knee sales in customers with the Mako robot are growing at approximately 4 times the rate of our non-Mako customers. With respect to NOVADAQ, in September, we completed the acquisition for a net purchase price of $674 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of SPY fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow and perfusion with over 250 clinical studies and array of specialties. The company's product portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker's visualization platform, augmenting our advanced imaging offering in MIS and expanding our presence into open surgery applications such as plastic reconstructive surgery. Since completing the deal in early September, we have integrated the teams, inclusive of a large cross-training on the products, education led by KOLs and subject matter experts, and hands-on training sessions for our combined sales force. We also finalized our 2018 sales structure. We are actively identifying portfolio synergies and collaborating amongst the sales team on combined quotes to our customers, as they look to standardize to this full advanced imaging portfolio. Beyond the sales force, NOVADAQ has an extensive clinical research team and impressive R&D team. We are excited about the long-term opportunities to advance the visualization market. As Glenn will discuss in more detail, we remain on track with our financial target with NOVADAQ expected to be neutral to 2018 earnings and accretive thereafter. Lastly, earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire VEXIM, which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for \u20ac183 million. VEXIM's flagship product is the SpineJack system, a mechanical expandable VCF implant for fracture reduction and stabilization. The company's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker's Instruments division whose key products include an extensive and innovative portfolio for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures, along with a diagnostic tool and decompression treatment advances for contained disc herniations. VEXIM had sales of \u20ac18.5 million in 2016, which was an increase of 33% over the prior year. The company's 510(k) clinical trial for the SpineJack system is progressing, and we anticipate filing for approval in 2018. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. My comments today will be focused on our third quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. The detailed financial data and results have been included in today's press release. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 5.5%. As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, reducing growth by roughly 1%. As we've previously stated, selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 0.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by the Sage product action and the hurricanes that interrupted business in Texas and Florida. These events negatively impacted our overall organic sales growth by 240 basis points. In the U.S., we continue to see good momentum with organic sales growth of 5.6%, which was evident within Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments. Our U.S. organic sales were negatively impacted by the aforementioned Sage product action and weather-related matters by 320 basis points. Our international organic sales growth of 5.2% was highlighted by solid performances in Europe, Asia and Latin America. All geographies were impacted by one less selling day. Our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52 increased 9.4% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales volumes and some favorability in our effective tax rate. Our third quarter EPS, as anticipated, was not significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Taking into account the Sage product actions, the impact of weather and NOVADAQ, we estimate that our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.05 per share. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%, including U.S. organic growth of 6.1%. Adjusting for weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S. Orthopaedic business had organic growth of 6.7%. We experienced a number of canceled hip and knee procedures in Houston and more significantly in Florida as a result of the hurricanes. We anticipate many of these cases will be rescheduled in the coming months, but cannot predict scheduling availability during Q4. Our U.S. performance was highlighted by growth in Knees of 4.3% and Trauma and Extremities at 9.9%. These growth rates include the impact of weather-related disruptions. We continue to see strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, our Triathlon knee and our Mako robotics platform. Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 1.2% and included steady performances across all developed markets. MedSurg continued to have strong results in the quarter with constant currency growth of 6.2% and organic growth of 5.6%, which included a 5.3% increase in the U.S. Adjusting for the Sage-related product actions and weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S. MedSurg group had organic growth of 11.6%. Our Instruments business had U.S. organic sales growth of 6.4%. This growth is highlighted by continued ramping of our Power Tools business, including our newly launched System 8, as well as good performances of our Sterishield and waste management products. Our Endoscopy business had another strong quarter, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.8%. This reflects continued strong demand not only for our 1588 video platform, but also booms and lights and sports medicine implants. During the quarter, Endoscopy completed its acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies, Inc. Including this acquisition, U.S. Endoscopy sales growth during the quarter was 13.8%. Our Medical business had U.S. organic sales decline of 1%. This reflects the impact of the previously discussed Sage product action, which is in line with our previous Q3 Sage disclosure, as well as a nominal impact related to weather matters. Adjusted for these matters, Medical's U.S. organic sales growth was 15.4%. This growth primarily reflects underlying strong U.S. growth across Medical's acute care, EMS and Physio businesses, which include continued robustness in our core structure and power cot products. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 7.1%, which reflects strong growth in our Medical businesses, primarily in Europe. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 7%. We continue to see strong global demand for our Neurotech products, which is somewhat offset by softness in our spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 11.8% for the quarter, highlighted by strong demand for our hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products, CMF products and our neuro-powered instruments. Our U.S. spine business continued to see softness across many product areas, which is partially offset by high demand for our 3D-printed Tritanium products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 10.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Now we'll focus on operating highlights for the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was down 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable mix, price declines and the impact from the disruption to our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria. We continue to invest in innovation with R&D spending of 6.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was up 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This also reflects some negative impacts from our Sage product actions, weather-related matters and the impact related to the consolidation of our NOVADAQ acquisition during the quarter. Additionally, we continue to invest in our CTG program, including our ERP implementation, and in our Mako TKA platform. In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.8% of sales, which is up 40 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales and down 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The impact from Sage, weather-related matters and NOVADAQ on our adjusted operating margin was approximately 75 basis points. As it relates to our full-year operating margin expectation, excluding the impact of the one-time items related to Sage, weather and NOVADAQ, we continue to anticipate delivering 30 to 50 basis points improvement. Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other income and expense decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased interest income. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses as well as benefits in geographic income mix. In the fourth quarter, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated full-year effective tax rate in the range of 15.5% to 16%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.2 billion. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $880 million year-to-date. This includes year-to-date recall-related payments of $492 million. And now I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance. Based on our past performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we anticipate full-year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter will have the same amount of selling days as 2016. The full year has one less selling day. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the fourth quarter will be impacted positively by 1% and the full year to be nominally impacted. We expect a negative impact on adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.02 per share and $0.10 in the full year. With respect to the outlook, recall that in August when we announced the Sage recall, we revised our 2017 EPS outlook to come in at the low end of our $6.45 to $6.55 range, which excluded the anticipated $0.03 to $0.05 of dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we now expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share, including $0.05 of dilution related to NOVADAQ, as well as the impacts related to Sage product actions and weather disruptions to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share. And now we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Kevin, I want to talk about, obviously, growth for a second here. I think, even if you adjust out the weather impact, your growth still represents perhaps 8% organic, which is the best number, I think, we've seen in years. So I wonder if you can just share some broad commentary. I know MedSurg was strong this quarter. And I know you're not going to give guidance for 2018. But just thinking about broad strokes into next year, could you just touch briefly on where you see improving momentum in the next year and where you see some sustained growth across some of your key franchises? Then I'd have a quick follow-up for Glenn. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, thanks, David. We're very pleased with the underlying business, even if you look at the Medical division, which obviously had the Sage impact. The other businesses had very strong double-digit growth, whether it was Physio-Control or our core legacy Medical business. We had strength in Neurotechnology, strength in Trauma and Extremities, really strength in a number of areas. And we feel very good about our business momentum, our new product cycle. As you know, it varies by division. I'm not going to go through every single division, but I would say you should expect us to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech going forward. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe just there two follow-ups, I'll merge them together here. Just to follow-up on growth is, as you think about growth in Orthopaedics next year, I wonder if you can share with us how much momentum is coming from the Mako halo, the cementless piece versus competitive disruption, and how important Mako cementless knee is for next year? And then for Glenn, just thinking about some of the headwinds to earnings this year, Glenn, Sage, NOVADAQ, FX headwinds, if I think about how those go next year, NOVADAQ should be accretive, Sage obviously gets accretive and no longer dilutive, and FX may move to a slight positive versus negative. Should we think about that as somewhat of a $0.15-plus swing into 2018? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I'll take the Mako question. I would say we continue to see the bulk of the benefit is from the halo effect. It's getting into competitive accounts, which is about 40% of our robot installations. Selling the whole portfolio, typically, the first thing they do once they have the robot is start using our Triathlon implants for traditional surgery to start to get used to it. We've had tremendous success. After a very conservative limited release of our UNI, we've had tremendous success over the past three-plus years. It's 20% of the mix. It was low-singles to start. And we believe that will continue to climb for a number of quarters. And the Mako procedure volumes are ramping. Utilization rates are ramping. So it's, obviously, becoming more material, but I wouldn't say it's the key driver of our results with respect to Mako. But it obviously has an impact, as I mentioned, in the Mako accounts. We're growing our Total Knee portfolio in the U.S. about four times faster than that comparable portfolio in non-Mako accounts. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: David, as you think about op margin, and we're not giving guidance for 2018, but I can comment that, yes, NOVADAQ was $0.05 dilutive and will be this year. And we're assuming that it will have no effect in next year. So it'll essentially be flat for next year. So, that's a little bit of a tailwind. As it relates to Sage, Sage will continue to ramp, but it's not going to immediately reach its previous sales levels to where we'll feel a one-for-one impact relative to our operating margin. And then, as we mentioned, the weather goes away and we're anticipating that hopefully we'll be able to make most of that up in Q4 anyways. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on an outstanding quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So I thought for my questions I just want to clarify a couple of things. First of all, in terms of just the organic revenue growth of the company, I mean, my math ex-hurricanes, Sage and selling days, gets you to 8.9%, just shy of 9% growth. So I guess my first question is, is that accurate when I just add up all these numbers that you're close to 8.9% this quarter? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Bob, organic growth of 5.5%, Sage and hurricanes of 2.4%, takes you to 7.9%. And then if you estimated a 1% impact relative to one less selling day, you get to 8.9%. Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's quite the number. So, just \u2013 second question is just clarifying again on two things. Can we do the same exercise on knee growth? Because that's obviously something that people are really focused on. So knee growth constant currency was 3.9%. I would imagine the selling day impact was like more \u2013 it was more like 1.5% for knees and then maybe 60 basis points for weather. So, was kind of adjusted knee growth closer to 6% than the 3.9% we see? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Your math is right. Selling days really don't have an impact on our capital businesses, which is around 20%. It has a more pronounced impact on recon and some of the Trauma business to about 150 basis points. And then knees were probably impacted somewhere around 70 bps from the hurricane. So you need to adjust for those factors. We're not seeing anything when we look in the quarter or at our rolling four-quarter trends with our knee business to suggest anything has changed. We believe we're taking market share. We need to obviously see everybody else's results. Q3, as you know, is the seasonally weakest and tends to be the noisiest of quarters, but underlying growth seems very stable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, everybody. And let me just pick up on Bob's question just on the knee business. So, if we try and adjust for everything, which is hard to do this quarter, and with the knee business, it's not an easy comp. But the year-over-year growth in the U.S. is 4.3% on a reported basis here this quarter. Let's say it's 6% or 6%-plus adjusting for the noise in the quarter of selling day and weather and so forth. Are you surprised that that's not a little bit higher given the success you're having with Mako? And does it indicate that a lot of the early Mako volume is from existing users? And I'm trying to separate volume from the comment on Mako purchases. So, just trying to tease out all the progress in Mako this quarter relative to the year-over-year growth in U.S. knees? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. We're not seeing that. We're looking at a number of different metrics, whether it's surgeons trained, the pace of their training, the utilization rates which up 50% year-over-year; they also continue to increase each quarter this year and the number of surgeries being done. So I think, at the end of the day, we have to obviously wait and see everybody's numbers. And you're right, there's a lot of noise and moving parts. Could this be an incrementally weaker knee quarter or hip quarter than prior quarter? It's possible. These numbers move around quarter-to-quarter. But nothing we're seeing or hearing from our customers in the field suggests to us that there's any underlying change in market dynamics. So, to the degree that the numbers add up and it looks sequentially a bit slower, if that's the case, I just put it into quarterly noise as opposed to something else. And just like if Q4 comes in seasonally strong as it typically does, I don't think that's anything other than what's traditionally a really strong fourth quarter in hips and knees. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Mike, I'd just add we feel very good about our knee business and we're excited about getting the cementless approval so that we can market that with Mako as well, because I believe the combination of robotics and 3D printing will be very powerful going forward. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Let me just do a couple of quick follow-ups. Katherine, Sage was a $50 million lost sales number this quarter. What are you assuming in your fourth quarter guide for kind of the Sage still headwind that you have in front of you? And then second, Neurovascular continues to do exceptionally well. The data points we picked up over the course of the quarter just kind of suggesting that the whole shift of endovascular therapy for ischemic stroke had picked up some steam in the last six months. Is that consistent? Are you picking that up at all? Is that what's driving the business? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Sure. So, on Sage, probably looking at about $55 million-ish in lost revenue in the third quarter and we think it's going to be a little south of that, maybe in the $45 million vicinity in the fourth quarter, but we really also have to see how we're doing. We have work to do to win back customers. We really annoyed them with these recalls and shipment issues. But, again, given Sage's leadership position and the strength of that portfolio, we do think we'll win back that business. But that's probably a pretty good approximation. And then on the Neurovascular business, we continue to see really strong momentum, both in hemorrhagic and ischemic. Ischemic tends to move around quarter-to-quarter. It's healthy double-digit growth, but it does bounce around. But the increasing clinical data out there that continues to expand is really helping drive that business and some really good execution by our team. So we're really pleased with where the Neurovascular, Neurotechnology business is right now. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We had also great performance. If you look at our neuro-powered instruments, they also performed very well. But getting back to Neurovascular, it's across the entire portfolio, whether it's hemorrhagic or ischemic, and it's across all geographies. They run themselves as a global business and they are absolutely on fire. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. You may proceed. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Ian Mahmud on for Matt. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, we can. Sure. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, we can. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. So you mentioned that there was some softness in U.S. spine in your prepared remarks. I'm hoping you could give us your high level view on the spine market, essentially, what your team is seeing in the field and just your take on overall market strength for the quarter. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think it's pretty clear based on all the results today that the spine market continues to be challenged, and ours were no exception. There's pricing pressure. We've got about 30% of the market that's either physician-owned or PODs or private, so it's a little hard to gauge the market. But it's a challenging market right now for us and for others. We are doing well in our IVS, our Interventional Spine business as they're putting up some good growth. But the traditional spine business continued to be challenged, and we're not assuming any big recovery near term. Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just as a follow-up, do you think you're gaining share or losing share? Is there movement in terms of on the rep side? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think we're probably pretty much in line with the market, give or take. I don't think there's a discernible trend one way or the other. Operator : Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Hi, Bruce. Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Sorry. I was on mute. This is Matt in for Bruce. Can you hear me okay? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, we can. Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. Just, first of all, on the updated guidance, just wondered if you can give us some more color on \u2013 from a revenue perspective, going from the low end of 6.5% to 7% to back to 6.5% to 7%, what kind of changed there? Was it just the strength in the third quarter or was it more the trends that you're seeing in the fourth quarter that caused you to increase those numbers? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think a lot of it is \u2013 first of all, gaining more clarity around Sage is very helpful in terms of us formulating where we think the guidance will come out. Closing on NOVADAQ and getting a much closer look at that was also very helpful in just understanding how those will play into our numbers. And then the final thing is we know seasonally that Q4 is very, very strong for us and we're coming off a very strong Q3 across a broad swath of all of our businesses. We also see good product momentum, specifically in some of our newer products that have launched, and we expect that to continue. So I think all of that gave us the confidence in rolling up the numbers to get to sort of a better look at where our guidance is coming out. Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up to clarify an earlier comment on the storm impact to sales in the third quarter. You said there was procedures, capital equipment, that you think you lost and the cover in the press release is helpful on how much that was. But I guess you said you didn't expect it to be a material impact in 4Q. And I guess my thought is that some of that would come back there and you might see a material benefit to sales. Why wouldn't that be material? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: It's just not big enough. It's not all going to come back in the fourth quarter. It depends on surgery schedules for the surgeon, for the patients. And so, given the overall magnitude, we think our overall strength of our fourth quarter business we can manage through any procedures. And we expect those to come back, whether or not it's all in Q4 or over the next few quarters, we'll just have to wait and see. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the guidance. From the bottom-line perspective, now you're embedding in the dilution. What gives you the confidence to kind of go with that range? Is it just the confidence in the top line or anything changed on the dilution with NOVADAQ? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Kristen, there's no real change on the dilution with NOVADAQ. I think, really, just the robustness and strength of the top line that we're expecting, and not only just in Q3, but just what we typically and historically have seen in Q4. And so, that really will allow us to kind of cover some of these things that previously we thought would have a bigger impact. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just to start off with the comment that I think either Katherine or Kevin, you made on the Mako growth that you're seeing from a procedural perspective. I think you said, within those accounts, you're seeing the knee business grow at 4x the other accounts. Can you just expand a little bit on that? Is it a function of those customers are attracting just so many more patients that they're growing so much faster? Or is there some other dynamic going on that's driving that type of growth? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think it's really a combination of the fact that we're putting robots into existing Stryker accounts. And if they're doing procedures on the robot, it has to be done with a Stryker Knee. So, that inherently means we're going to be taking more of that business, replacing about 40% of the robots. And that's been very consistent and competitive accounts, where we either have no market share or it's well below our average. And so, that's all new business. And it's not just selling Triathlon to be done on the robot. It's selling the whole portfolio. Our 3D-printed cementless product offering has been incredibly successful. Our 3D-printed revision codes and sleeves, that enables us to capture the revision implant business. So it's really the combined effect that really allows us to increase the revenue we're deriving in Mako accounts versus non-Mako. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And that story is the same story in Europe. So we're replacing robots also outside United States. We get the same kind of halo effect and overall growth in our knee business. Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then as the follow-up, your Trauma and Extremities business again this quarter was really strong with a difficult comp. And I think, as I look at my model, this is the best performance that you've seen out of that business on a tiered stack basis in the last couple of years. So is there something specifically driving that improvement there? And then how much momentum or juice do you have to continue this level of growth out of that business? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Look, it was a fantastic quarter. And if you recall, going back almost five years, this has been a business that's outperformed the market year-after-year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter. If you go back two or three years, we were regularly posting double-digit growth. The last year or so, the comps started to catch up with us, but they put up a terrific quarter. And it was really across the board. If I look at Foot and Ankle had a terrific quarter. Our Shoulder business was very strong and even our core Trauma business. So this is something where we focused, we dedicated sales reps. we made investments, we filled out our product portfolio, and we're bearing a lot of fruit from that. So it wouldn't be just one thing I could point to. I think it's just increased momentum that's been building over a number of years, more specialization, more focus. And it's driving really terrific results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. You may proceed. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Glenn, I just want to circle back to your comment on operating margin expansion. If I adjust for the 75-basis-point headwind from one-time items this quarter, it looks to me like you're about flat here through the first nine months of the year. Is that your math as well? And if so, then how do you get to that 30- to 50-basis-point underlying full-year improvement? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think we're actually a little up year-to-date, but you're right, it's maybe close to flat. If you go back and look at Q4, it typically is our strongest sales quarter and also generates the greatest amount of leverage in every single year. We'll expect that that will also happen this year with our sales growth expectations. Also, we're beginning to see some of the benefits from our CTG investments, which I think will contribute to that in Q4. And then if I think about excluding those impacts of Sage, weather, NOVADAQ, which are not incidental to the margin, I think we'll be in the range of 30 to 50 basis points for the full year. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Kevin, emerging markets is a smaller piece of your business than it is for some of your competitors. But just love to hear your updated thoughts on the strategy in the EM and also how you think some of these markets are going to evolve, particularly China, as they institute some new regulations there going forward? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Look, we had a good quarter in emerging markets. It grew at high-single digits, and that's with a bit of negative growth from India. As you know, they had some severe price controls around knee implants which hit us. But, overall, emerging markets was a high-single-digit growth. China, for us, is a very important market for the future, even with the impending changes that they're making. We have a very, very low market share, especially in our implant business. And we have a new leader for China, who's starting this quarter and we're very excited about, and we're making a lot of changes. China actually is contributing to growth this year after a couple of difficult years of destocking. And so we're encouraged. We are very committed to the emerging markets long-term. In spite of some of the temporary challenges related to nationalism and other things, there are going to be big markets, important markets. We're going to take a bit of a patient approach. So we're not going to invest huge amounts of money. But we are going to make sure we have the right channel in place and then make the appropriate investments to continue to fuel growth. But it's been growing for us this year, and we had a good quarter again in the third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. You may proceed. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, Kevin. Let me start with Physio-Control. Obviously, you're very early on in some new product cycles, but my sense is haven't fully gotten underway in each segment of the business. Can you help us understand where we are and the potential impact on growth? And maybe as part of that, I saw that Philips recently suspended U.S. defibrillator production. Is that something you're positioned to take advantage of and could be helpful? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Hi, Rick. Yeah. So, Physio had a terrific quarter and really benefit, a lot of it was in Europe. So their new AED has been launched in Europe. Has not been launched in the U.S. yet, it's pending approval, but has been launched in Europe and it did very, very well in the third quarter. We also have our new CPR-assist device, the LUCAS 3, which has been launched globally. And that's performing very well. But we haven't yet launched a new manual defibrillator. So I would say we're sort of early in the new product cycle, but that business has performed very well in the third quarter. And as it relates to Philips, look, this is certainly going to benefit all the other players in the market. But it's capital purchase, so it's not something that \u2013 I think you look at something like Sage, which is a disposable. They need to use those every single day. You can't defer those procedures. So, that market share would shift much more quickly than a capital business. But we do stand to benefit along with other large players in the market. Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just as a follow-up on Mako, one more from me. I'd be curious to hear just was the quarter on the system side ahead of what you might have expected, Kevin? And if it was, maybe talk about your experience so far? I mean, if it was ahead of plan, what have you learned in terms of the launch and how people are deciding? And I mean, related to capital availability or decision making, is it happening faster than you might have thought despite the need to upgrade? Just, again, any color would be welcome. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Look, we've been very pleased all year with the performance of Mako. And the third quarter was no exception. We've done a terrific job of hiring our Makoplasty specialists, of doing knee upgrades as well as selling new capital. It's a tricky challenge that was put on our team. Demand continues to be very strong. We don't have any manufacturing capacity issues. The real issue is getting surgeons trained. But I would say, every quarter, they performed extremely well. And we have a good pipeline. I expect this momentum to continue. And as you've seen, the buzz about robotics, the story has completely changed. And now no one is doubting whether robotics are here to stay. It's only a question of which robot and when do we get on the board with robotics. And that's a seachange versus even a-year-and-a-half or two years ago. So I think the tailwind of people seeing the value of this. And as we start to publish clinically, as Katherine alluded to in her prepared remarks, I think that's only going to fuel the fire. So, very bullish about the future, and the team continues to execute extremely well. But there's no new dynamic. I would say this is \u2013 disruptive technologies take a little while to take hold, as you've seen in other parts of healthcare. And this is one that's really starting to take hold now. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question on Sage. Kevin, I heard you say earlier that you expect to recapture share of the coming quarters. I guess could you be a little bit more specific when you think you can get back to the pre-recall run rate? And I had one follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think we're pretty early. We just resumed shipping all products, which we're really pleased with, and that just started in September. And so I think we're going to have to see how our customers react. We have work to do. Our sales force are focused on that, but it'd be premature to start speculating when it all comes back. We do believe we can regain the lost share. I don't believe it's going to happen all in Q4. And then we're just going have to get a little bit more time under our belt and more discussions with our customers. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Just as a guide, and this is not a prediction, right, but just as a guide, if you look at Neptune and how that came back, it took us roughly a year to regain all of our previous business. Now that of course has a capital component. So it's not a perfect analog, but this won't happen in one quarter, it won't happen in two quarters, but I do believe we have a pathway to regain the business. I'm very excited with how the team is executing, how they're performing. But we have customers that were upset. We have some customers that have entered into contracts that don't expire in 90 days. And so we have to work to regain the business. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then I heard your comments earlier about the spine market but not much on your own spine business and the strategy there, and when you expect that business to start turning positive again. So, any color there would be helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I mean, clearly our core spine business has work to do. We're going to continue to invest in the R&D pipeline and invest in our sales force. But it's a challenging market right now. And I don't want to pretend that we've got good visibility as to when the market or us will be back to growth. So we're assuming it remains challenging and I think we need to see some evidence of momentum returning before we start to speculate on where growth will go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is now open. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on a terrific quarter, especially, just on the upgrades for Mako. It's impressive to get to 50% penetration at this point in the launch. So I had one follow-up on the U.S. knee growth. I know sort of like adding the pluses and headwinds and so on, I just wanted to make sure we get this right. If we look at U.S. growth of 4.3% figure, to Bob's point, 1.5% or something like that, and then given the storm impact was primarily in the U.S., I guess it's closer to 1% impact. Just to make sure I'm looking at this the right way, it seems like that growth would be closer to 7% than 6%. Is that math approximately right? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think we'd probably split the difference. We think the \u2013 and again, this isn't perfect science, but we think... Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: ...the hurricanes impacted our U.S. knee business by about 70 basis points. Selling days typically have a 150-basis-point impact on our joint business. And so, if you add that to that underlying 4.3%, you get something at the midpoint between 6% and 7%, and that's what we think our true organic U.S. knee growth was. Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then if I could, just sort of a combination follow-up question. One in terms of first time around the horn here with the Mako knee launch and just love to get your sense as to how we should think about the seasonality of capital budgets, et cetera, for systems heading into the fourth quarter? And the second part of that, unrelated, you mentioned the SpineJack acquisition. Obviously, interesting interventional addition. But, to Larry's question on spine, is there something more significant in terms of investments going beyond R&D that you feel like you need to do on the kind of the fusion and Regen (47:03) side of the business to sort of reinvigorate growth? Is that on the table? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So I'll take the spine one first. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities that could augment our product portfolio. But right now the focus of the group is really understanding the market dynamics, executing on the products we have. We've had great success with things like our 3D-printed cage, but there are supply issues there. And so the team needs to \u2013 really to execute. And as I mentioned, this is a challenging market. So I don't see a magic fix near term. The pending VEXIM deal, that really goes into the IVF business within Instruments where they've actually been seeing some pretty good momentum there. And then, in terms of Mako, it's capital. So the robot, the $1 million (47:28); Q4 is typically the strongest capital business across the board, whether it's MedSurg or Ortho. And I don't anticipate anything different. Hospitals are looking to use up their budgets by year-end. We have a Flex Financial Group that can go in and work with them on lease options and the like. So I would assume robots have the typical seasonality that we see with our other capital businesses. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Just to add on spine, I think we have launched a couple of new products that we're presenting at our NASS conference right now. Tritanium C, which is the great 3D-printed interbody that we've had great success in the lumbar space and the cervical space, which we're very excited about, as well as Serrato which is a new easy-to-insert pedicle screw. So, a couple of new products. We obviously have more to do in terms of innovating around our new products. And of course, we'll always, like we do at every division, look for other ways to augment the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. So, another question on Mako. I was hoping you could compare-contrast what you're seeing in the U.S. versus Europe with regards to demand, competitive landscape and the types of physicians that are showing interest between the two regions. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: It's really \u2013 the game plan is the same. We look for where there's a surgeon champion to make sure that when the robot is placed, we're going to see utilization ramp, which is what we're seeing. So there really isn't a different strategy in terms of how we identify who the right target is. It varies by geography. Obviously, with 385 in the U. S., the U.S. is our biggest market. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. And I'd just say, in Europe, Europe isn't one country as you know. So there are some very attractive countries and some that are not as attractive. And I'd say the attractive category would be the UK, Germany, Italy. Those are probably the three areas that are most attractive. And some of the other countries will take a little longer. They're going to want to wait to see more data before they start to adopt. But we're doing well in Europe. We're starting to pick up momentum. The surgeon interest is the same. And again, as we do more publications, certain countries \u2013 just like we've seen with a place like Canada, some countries are slower to adopt this type of technology than in Australia, which already has a very large number of robots and pretty fast adoption. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then just a follow-up maybe for Glenn on the margin side. If I think about some of the moving parts exiting the year with the M&A and so forth, would you be able to give us, at some point, an update as to what the normalized margin expansion for the business looks like? Because I would imagine that some of the deals you're doing here will give you the opportunity to at least hit the higher end of the range versus what you previously articulated. And just trying to get a sense of what the real margin expansion cadence can be as you have a little bit more to work with on efficiency. Thank you. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I think going back to when we introduced sort of the cost transformation for growth program we talked about margin expansion over a five-year period of time. That included sort of a range of 30 to 50 basis points of expansion each year and 30 basis points in the earlier year, ramping more to like 50 basis points in the latter year. And really, beyond that, I think you can look at sort of what we've historically done in Q4 in operating margins, which is fairly more significant than the first three quarters of a year. And that should give you pretty good guidance. And we'll revisit it at Q4 when we give guidance for 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, we can. Sure. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Wonderful. Two quick questions. First of all, could you please give us an update generally what the capital equipment environment is looking like? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We are not really seeing any changes. Medical, if you look at the numbers I posted for our legacy medical business, that's all capital. That's structures and costs, and we've seen double-digit growth there, double-digit growth for Physio. Q4, as you know, is the seasonally strongest capital quarter. We feel really good about our capital market right now. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. And then because of that and I also so I have to ask this question, how are you thinking about a spying robot? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think, as you think about Mako, we believe there's a number of applications beyond the hip and knee joints, but that's really the focus right now. So we do believe that there's going to be opportunities in spine and shoulders and other areas. But right now, we are really focused on ensuring that we have a very successful launch of the Total Knee. We only have one chance to get this right. And we feel really pleased with the trajectory around there. But we will also be looking at other applications because we do think there's opportunities outside of hips and knees. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Very strong knee and hips when you take out weather, when you take out the one less selling day. But I wonder if you're also benefiting from the fact that number one player in the market, they are still struggling with their output and production. So I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the competitive environment and how much are you benefiting from just the number one player still struggling. And I had one more follow-up on the Mako. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. It's difficult. We need to wait for Zimmer, Smith & Nephew to report to get a full picture in the quarter. What I can tell you is we believe our strategy is working. Our focus on Mako, targeting competitive accounts, investing in this Mako specialist, investing in our sales force there is driving share gains. So, regardless who may be challenged in the market, we're going to stick to this game plan because we do believe it's working well. And we'll get a better sense of how market shares have moved around once everybody has reported. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Fair enough. And then the 33 robots that you sold in the quarter, can you remind us what percentage of these are outright sales versus leases? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: The majority are outright sales. We don't break it down between sales and lease. We do offer leasing options through Flex Financials. But even if \u2013 once they're walked through the leasing option, more often than not they tend to purchase. So I'd say the majority are purchases. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. You may proceed. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. So, a quick follow-up on spine and then one on Mako. So I know you commented on the spine market, continues to be challenging, and that on your strategy there. But I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about how that sort of big-picture concern has impacted or changed your investment strategy going forward, i.e. is it maybe less or more enthusiastic about certain areas within spine? Or has the overall market softness and the need to understand that dynamic sort of negatively impacted your appetite for more heavy investment in that area beyond the VEXIM deal? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So, I would tell you, we're committed to the spine market. We believe it's an important part of Orthopaedics. There's tremendous unmet need and opportunities to continue to innovate like we did with our 3D-printed products. Throughout the years, we inevitably have businesses that are more challenged. Just look at China in more recent years for us. We're going to stick to investing in the business. We've got great leadership. And eventually these markets write themselves. It just happens to be a period where spine is particularly challenged. We're big enough, diverse enough and global enough that we can manage through that and still deliver what we believe are exceptional organic growth rates. So it really doesn't change how we think about the business and we really can't pivot like that just based on quarter-to-quarter results. Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Mako, I know you mentioned Mako utilization rates are moving higher. So, first, can you help us understand if there is much of a variance just across your systems in terms of that utilization growth? And then can you also help us parse out through the specific drivers of that? Is it more patient-driven? Is it the clinical work you're doing? And then just what gives you confidence that we can continue to see sequential improvements in that metric going forward? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So we're early in the launch. We just went into the full launch in March at Academy. I will tell you what we see is where we've got physicians who are interested in new technology, that's where we have the greatest sponsorship, and then it typically can expand into a given practice. We're just in the early stages of the clinical data. Encourage you to take a look at the recent publication in the knee surgery journal. We're going to continue to invest in those areas and believe all of that will drive utilization rates. It's pre-mature to think about direct-to-consumer because we need to get more robots out there. But we're going to stick with the same plan; train surgeons, focus where there is a surgeon champion, investing in clinical studies, investing in the Mako sales force and our broader team. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I'd just like to add that it's really encouraging to see the adoption occurring across the different types of hospitals, so academic teaching hospitals, rural community hospitals, even surgery centers. So, to see Mako appearing across the spectrum is really exciting. And especially the academic centers where initially there was some belief that that might take a little longer, we're seeing really good adoption. So it's really across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. You may proceed. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Thanks, and good evening. I just wanted to first start off with a follow-up question on the Mako halo effect and just any updated thoughts on the potential future benefit for the hip franchise as you get deeper into the Mako Total Knee launch. And are there any other catalysts for the USA franchise on the horizon? I think the 3D-printed acetabular cup launch is next year, but just wanted to [Technical Difficulty] (57:46). Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah... Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sorry. You broke up a little at the end, but go ahead. Go ahead. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So, on Mako, you were asking in terms of the utilization uptake, and I think we're going to continue to \u2013 we expect that to continue to ramp here. I don't anticipate a real change. We are launching a new 3D-printed acetabular cup. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We're in limited launch right now. The early surgeon feedback is very strong on the cup. The full launch won't be until probably the middle part. Second or third quarter next year, we'll move into full launch. But so far the feedback is very positive. And as you know, we've had a bit of a dry product cycle within hips the last year or two. Prior to that, we had very, very strong market-leading growth in hips when we had the new stems that we launched, including Accolade II. But this is a very modern 3D-printed cup. We're very excited about it. It hasn't started to contribute to growth yet but should be a catalyst in 2018. And the halo effect is very powerful. It's not just also in knees. I think it's going to start to extend to other parts. Once you have a Stryker sales rep that has a license to hunt inside an (58:59) account and they start to show you the breadth of our offerings, I think that will extend. Right now, obviously we're measuring it as it relates to knee. But getting into places where you've never been is wildly exciting. It opens all kinds of other doors. And that's something we look forward to in the future. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. And just a follow-up on the Sage remediation efforts. Is there any more major work that's still needed to be done? I mean, you guys are not impacted in terms of getting the product back on the market. But any color in terms of incremental costs and where you are in that remediation process would be helpful. Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So we expect to be at full availability of our product portfolio by the end of the fourth quarter, which is consistent with what we've stated in August when we first announced it. We have a lot of work to do with our customers as we touched on. So, as we mentioned, we disrupted them and inconvenienced them and made it really challenging for products that they use every day. So we have to work to win them back. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And it's been a massive undertaking. We had to expand our test lab facilities pretty significantly. And we have to ramp production. So we have to make all of the SKUs across all the product families and restock the pipeline and that just takes time. But I'm very excited that every product family we are shipping, we have no more sort of other gating factors, other than just scaling the manufacturing and filling up the supply chain. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. You may procced. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I'll ask one on Mako as well. I'm just curious, as you're starting to get a broader utilization of the robot now, what you're seeing in terms of treatment times? Have you seen treatment times coming down to where they're starting to be time-neutral or does it still take longer on the robot? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: It really depends on the surgeon. There are a number of surgeons that are faster on the robot. I would say the average of surgeons are slightly slower. But time is not a barrier. So, even for the surgeons who are a little bit slower on the robot, the feedback we get from them is that I liked having a little extra time to make decisions that I could never make before because I can have inter-operative feedback, dynamic feedback through the full range of motion prior to making cuts and I want to be able to make different decisions that I could never make before. So we were very careful. We took a whole year, if you recall, prior to the full launch to make sure that time wasn't going to be the barrier. And at this stage of the launch, we have enough surgeons trained, enough surgeons doing procedures for us to be able to say, look, time is not the barrier. And as I mentioned, in some cases, some surgeons are actually faster with the robot. So it really is more surgeon-dependent. And of course, the staff, you have to train the surgical service staff. There is a change in management that occurs and that's why I feel ramping up this technology doesn't happen overnight as it requires a lot of change management on behalf of the surgeon as well as the surgical staff. And that's what our team has spent a lot of time doing in their training to make sure that it's successful. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : No, it's great. And you mentioned also that you're seeing adoption in ambulatory surgery centers. And it's kind of a broader question about your thoughts on knees moving to the outpatient setting and in alternative settings for procedures getting done. And just really do you have any broad thoughts around what that could do to the business for you? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So, look, there's a lot of noise about it. It's still a very small part of the overall procedures that are done in surgery centers. I do think it's a trend that will continue going forward. And I think we'll be well-positioned to compete in the surgery centers as we are in the hospitals. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2017 results will be held on January 30, 2018. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sandra and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A. 2017 was another strong year for Stryker, including an impressive Q4 organic sales growth of 8.1%. And we again face tough year-over-year comparisons in Q4 across all three groups, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, underscoring the strength of our diversified revenue model. Growth was also balanced geographically with the U.S. posting organic gains of 8.6%, while OUS was up 6.7%. Within international growth was consistent across regions and Europe posted high single-digit gains for the third consecutive year, since we implemented the Transatlantic Operating Model. There were numerous standout above market performances in the quarter, which Glenn will cover in his section. For the full year despite Sage product supply issues, three major hurricanes and one less selling day, organic sales growth topped 7% exceeding our raised guidance of 6.5% to 7%. Both our Q4 and full year results reflect excellent sales and marketing execution coupled with value added innovation delivered by R&D and acquisitions. And through the tremendous effort of our global quality and operations team, we ensured continued product supply following the hurricanes as well as meeting our targets to return Sage products to the market. We continue to make strong progress with our cost transformation for growth initiatives which are yielding tangible results that will sustain ongoing operating margin expansion. Adjusted per share earnings claim 10.1% to a $1.96 for Q4 and we are up nearly 12% to $6.49 for the full year topping our targeted range of 635 to 645 established at the start of 2017. As you look ahead to 2018, we expect our top-line momentum to continue and target organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% for the full year, which we believe will once again be at the high end of med tech. Our outlook reflects robust product cycles across our divisions, continued strong sales and marketing execution and the benefit from acquisitions that are the past one year mark. The recent U.S. tax reform legislation and acquisition dilution will create headwinds for us in 2018, but with our strong top-line and operating margin expansion we are targeting full year adjusted per share earnings of $7.07 to $7.17. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on Mako, noted in our prerelease earlier this month momentum continued with Q4 Mako robot installations totaling 35 globally with 27 in the U.S. And in Q4 we had our first robot sale in Japan with approval for the Total Knee application expected by year end. We are also pleased that upgrades of existing robots in the field to the Total Knee application are pacing ahead of plan. Upgrades of our existing customers with the big focus in Q4 which does take considerable time from our capital sales force to close. We expect continued new robot installation as well as completing upgrade of the majority of robots in the U.S. during 2018. Since launch of the Total Knee application we have trained over 800 surgeons including roughly 200 in the fourth quarter. Mako Total Knee procedures for 2017 were 15,778 of which nearly 20% more with competitive surgeons who are using our Triathlon Total Knee implant for the first time. We continue to see approximately 40% of our robots installed in competitive accounts where we have well below average or no market share. We are clearly seeing the pull through spectrum accounts with Mako as our U.S. primary knee sales in Mako Total Knee accounts grew at 5 times the rate of accounts without the Mako Total Knee application. For all Mako applications, procedures in 2017 topped 42,500 versus 22,000 the prior year with all three applications growing. Mako utilization rates also continued to climb increasing over 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter for all Mako procedures and up roughly 30% sequentially fueled by Total Knee. We exited the year with Mako robots in 372 U.S. hospitals which represents about 10% of our customer base. We remain very encouraged by the strong customers\u2019 feedback which we anticipate will be evident at the upcoming AAOF meeting in March and subsequent surgeon meetings throughout the year. During 2017 we sold robots into a number of top tier academic hospitals where many of the industry key opinion leaders are camping the technology. This is enabling competitive conversions driven by surgeons focused on improved clinical outcomes achievable with the Mako total needs. Looking ahead to 2018, we believe we are well positioned to continue to drive Mako momentum including double digit year-over-year growth in new robot installations, completion of the upgrades of existing robots in the U.S., expansion OUS and further evidence of the improved clinical outcomes with the Mako Total Knee at both AAOS and later in 2017 at AAHKS. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Katherine. Today I will provide comments on our fourth quarter financial results and related performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 8.1% in the quarter included no difference in selling days. This resulted in full year organic growth of 7.1% which is slightly above the high end of our target growth range of 6.5% to 7%. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a 1.2% favorable impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continued to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 8.6% reflecting solid performances across our portfolio. International sales grew 6.7% organically, which was balanced across our international regions. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.96 increased 10.1% from the prior year quarter, reflecting strong sales growth and good operating expense control. Foreign currency including the impact of our hedging program had a nominal positive impact on fourth quarter EPS. Focusing on our segment highlights for the quarter, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency in organic growth of 6.8% led by the U.S. with organic growth of 8.1%. These gains reflect continued momentum in the U.S. trauma and extremities at 11.5% and knees at 10.5%, underlying this growth with strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio and our Mako platform. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency in organic growth of 4.1% led by our European businesses partially offset by our performance in Asia. MedSurg posted strong gains across all our businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 9.8% and organic growth of 8.5%, which included a 9.3% increase in the U.S. Instruments, grew U.S. sales 13.5% organically including robust growth from our Power Tools and Sterishield products. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic growth of 8.3% underscoring the strength of this product portfolio which includes the highly successfully 1588 and camera platform as well as its ProCare service support and sports medicine businesses. Medical had U.S. organic growth of 6.3% despite a $30 million loss in Sage product sales. This growth was driven by its core bed and power cot products, as well as strong accretive growth from Medical\u2019s Physio business. During the quarter, Medical\u2019s Sage business returned to market with all of its product families. We are seeing a positive response from our customers and remain focus on regaining loss market share as we move through 2018. Internationally MedSurg had constant currency growth of 6.7% and organic sales growth of 5.7%, which reflects solid performances in Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 10.3% and organic growth of 10%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted organic growth of 12.9% in the quarter highlighted by continued strong demand for our neurovascular products including our Target coil and AIS products as well as our CMF products in our neuropowered instruments. Our Spine business in the U.S. posted positive growth bolstered by continued demand for our IVS and 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. The core spinal market continues to be challenged and is softened throughout 2017. Internationally Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 15.6% and organic growth of 14.5%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and in Asia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.4% was in line with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted by absorption and productivity issues associated with the continued recovery of our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, as well as unfavorable pricing and mix including the impact of acquisitions. During the quarter, we continued to invest in our internal innovation with R&D spending totaling 5.9% of the sales and full year totaling 6.3%. Our SG&A of 33.5% of sales was 90 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. This reflects unfavorable leverage from our recent acquisition business mix including the impact related to our recent NOVADAQ acquisition and sales losses resulting from Sage product actions. Additionally, we have continued to make investments in our ongoing ERP initiative and certain sales growth initiatives, primarily Mako TKA, which were partially offset by favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program and other cost containment efforts. In total adjusted operating expenses were 39.4% of sales in the quarter, which was 80 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 27% of sales down 70 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our full year operating margin was down 30 basis points from the prior year. Adjusting full year operating margin for issues related to Puerto Rico and Sage and excluding dilution from NOVADAQ, our operating margin delivered over 30 basis points of improvement. Lastly I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses decreased from prior year quarter due primarily due reduced net interest expense and increased investment income. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1% reflects the benefits from our global tax structure partially offset by the impact of higher U.S. based income from our recent acquisitions. On December 22, 2017 the tax cut and job acts, the act was signing the law by the President, which provided for multiple changes in the current tax regulations. Most noticeably it included a reduction in U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, a current tax on previously deferred foreign earnings and profits and an ongoing tax related to certain returns related to asset sales and controlled foreign corporations. Related to these changes we reported an unfavorable adjustment to our U.S. deferred tax assets of $38 million reflecting the impact of the federal income tax rate change on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, a liability of approximately $785 million was recorded related to future tax payments on previously deferred foreign earnings and profits. Both of these adjustments have been reflected in our reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings. Moving on to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $2.8 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 62% was held outside of the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the year was $7.2 billion. Turning to cash flow, our full year cash from operations was approximately $1.6 billion during 2017 we repurchased approximately 230 million of shares. And now I will provide our 2018 guidance. Based on our momentum from 2017 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% for 2018. There are the same number of selling days in 2018 as in 2017, however as you update your quarterly models please note that Q1 has one less selling day, Q2 has one more selling day and while both Q3 and Q4 have the same number of days. The foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be favorable impacted by approximately 1% in 2018. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1% to 1.5% fairly consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2017. In addition, we expect our CTG program and other cost containment measures to add 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2018. We also anticipate that investment spending on CTG programs and ERP will continue to be at the same levels as 2017. As the new tax act relates to our 2018 effective tax rate, we anticipate that it will be a modest increase. The modifications to the internal revenue code include a much lower base U.S. federal corporate tax rate and a move to a more territorial system for corporations that have overseas earnings. However, certain provisions relates to the taxation of income streams from foreign subsidiaries are expected to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate more than offsetting the benefit related to U.S. rate reduction. As such we expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 will be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be $550 million to $600 million in 2018 as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure including year two of our worldwide ERP implementation to support future growth and operational efficiencies. This level compares to approximately $600 million of capital expenditures in 2017. At this time, we anticipate share buybacks of $300 million to essentially offset dilution in 2018. The foreign currency exchange rates remain at current levels and when considered along with our hedging program we expect modest favorability and net earnings per diluted share for the full year and first quarter. Finally, for 2018 we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $7.07 to $7.17 for the full year, including approximately $1.57 to $1.62 in the first quarter. Our guidance includes the aforementioned impact from the new tax act and foreign exchange as well as previously announced acquisition dilution including Intelius which is expected to close in Q1 with full year dilution estimated to be $0.04. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Just a few questions, Kevin I want to start with knee performance, if we think about as Stryker gain momentum in the fourth quarter its perhaps the widest as ever been, relative to peers, so why don\u2019t you talk about the primary factors and you\u2019ve discussed, as a Mako component, cementless as a component and competitive disruption. But how do you see the mix of those factors in the fourth quarter and how should investors think about, that momentum in 2018 and the factors driving that momentum in 2018? I had a follow-ups. Kevin Lobo : Sure thanks David. We are obviously delighted with our knee performance. Mako in general was a terrific performance for the year both in capital as well as upgrades, getting the Total Knees upgraded was a big factor. I would say that Mako was the biggest contributor to our outperformance, cementless of course continues to grow. We exited 2017 with 24% of our knees done cementless, pretty significant number we are only able to start promoting cementless with Mako in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s clearly some certain we\u2019re able to do that even prior to the official approval. Those are the two biggest factors, clearly there is and ahead of disruption that\u2019s occurring, but the degree of separation you heard Katherine talk about the number of certain change the momentum, the procedural growth with Mako, we are now in this mood were Mako is the biggest contributor to the growth. We\u2019re very excited and bullish about the prospects for the future and you would recall a few years ago, we said that after we do the full launch of the Total Knee we expected to gain 100s of basis points of market share and clearly this is only one quarter, but it\u2019s a terrific quarter. David Lewis : Okay very clear. And then Glenn, just a kind of a two part question for you, one I just, can you help us little bit with the earnings bridge for 2018 specifically components I mentioned in our FX, NOVADAQ, Sage and you gave us Intelius, but FX, NOVADAQ and Sage and then sort of related to that, if I think about the fourth quarter, you typically see about 250 basis points of margin improvement into the fourth quarter, if I adjust the third quarter for this one-time events. You had about 200 basis points into the fourth quarter, just wondering if there is anything from margin perspective or spending that was unique to the fourth quarter that carries on into 2018. Thank you so much. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes sure David. I think, first of all in terms of as you think about sort of earnings bridge from 2017 to 2018, you are right there probably are a number of tailwinds and some headwinds that certainly go away. I think in any one given years we look at 2018, we do have some positives and those would include FX, those would include recovering Sage, it would include Mako performance where we are on product cycles. We also have some challenges especially around the Spine market and changes in the tax laws that go the other way. I think the other thing we need to consider is that, at the beginning of the year, there are probably things that we don\u2019t even have visibility to that will certainly impact us during the year and we learned that lesson in 2017 for sure. So, as I think about our guidance for 2018 at this point where we are in the, we\u2019re targeting first of all sales growth that is at the highest level we have ever targeted at the beginning of any year. And we\u2019ve also targeted an EPS range that bracket sort of at the low end 9%, and at the high end in excess of 10.4%. And I think that more than supports the commitments that we have to delivering sales growth at the high-end of med tech and leverage earnings gains. Certainly, as the year unfolds, we\u2019ll continue to assess the targets, but we have high degree of conviction ability to deliver on the commitments that we\u2019ve laid out. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein : Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just start with on the margins. So first up, the fourth quarter as I understood your commentary so if you report a 70 basis point contraction relative to the kind of the street, but what you are saying is that if you back out Puerto Rico impact and the Sage impact and exclude the NOVADAQ dilution, your operating margin would have been up 30 basis points year-over-year? That\u2019s question one. And then question two, I want to make sure, I understood the 30 to 50 basis point commentary on margin improvement for 2018? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure, your understanding is exactly correct. If I remove the one-time expenses related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing facility that hit within margin, if I also adjust for the loss of Sage sales and then lastly if I remove the dilution that came from NOVADAQ we would have delivered 30 basis points up margin improvement. And then as it relates to the 30 or 50 basis points guidance that we are providing for 2018, I feel like as I think about that guidance, I feel very strong and very committed that we will deliver within that range the 30 to 50 basis points and maybe to the at least to the midpoint of that. Michael Weinstein : Okay and that\u2019s a 30 to 50 basis points including, the headwinds of Intelius and NOVADAQ margin dilution? Glenn Boehnlein : Correct. Michael Weinstein : Okay that\u2019s really helpful and then one last question for you. So, on the competitor call this morning, in the basis they look fourth quarter was really strong which we\u2019ve seen from multiple players obviously you guys had a fantastic fourth quarter. Are you assuming that the first quarter just because, the fourth quarter was so strong and first quarter just naturally going to be a little bit weaker, and are you seeing that and also are you seeing the impact from the UK that they talk about this morning and then later I just jump in? Thanks. Katherine Owen : Thanks Mike. A couple of comments, clearly the fourth quarter was a strong quarter and if we look at our recon business, we\u2019re obviously really pleased, but it was really about share gains and we grew based on what we know from whose reported over three times the rate of the overall market. When we look at the market if we\u2019re around 3% and that looks very comparable, again I\u2019m talking about U.S. recon growth a very comparable to the year ago quarter. So, we didn\u2019t see any excess seasonality in the fourth quarter, what we did see is the real beginnings of departure in our market share gains and greater share shift. And that\u2019s really the focus, Q1 we have one less selling day, so I would note that we have one extra selling day in the second quarter. So no change for the full year. The UK has started to put some restrictions on electric procedures due to flu, I would put that in the incremental headwind, but that does it materially change our view on seasonality. Now Q4 is seasonally the strongest, Q1 is seasonally the weakest, but that\u2019s not anything we expect to be different from prior years. And again the focus we have is really much more on market share gains, because if we can grow 3, 3.5 times of market, if obviously has a much bigger impact for us than a 10s of basis points swings to the positive or negative from either hurricanes or UK procedural slowdown. So nothing that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s different either for the fourth quarter or our expectations be what I said for the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Bob Hopkins : Hi thanks and good afternoon. Congrats on all the success with Mako, I want to start there if okay. I apologize if I missed this, and I know at the end of the third quarter call you said you did roughly 4,500 procedures with Mako and I know you gave an annual number. But can you give us a sense for what the Q4 procedure number was for Mako relative to that 4,500 in Q3 and then also maybe highlight what kind of what data we should expect at AOS? Katherine Owen : Bob, I\u2019ll follow-up with you offline, I don\u2019t have the quarterly breakdown in front of me at the moment and some of that keep in mind the 42,500 that was for all. Mako procedures in 2017 and that compared to the 22,000 the prior year, but I offline, I can give you the quarterly breakdown for the procedures for knees and the total volume. Clearly at academy there will be a big focus again will be on Mako what we are seeing in terms of physicians feedback, I think you\u2019re going to start to see more of the clinical data as we get closer to the back-half of the year at some of the key opinion leaders and their early clinical trials that they were doing. We start to get more of that data, so our guess will be bigger with respect to clinical data, but I would imagine that we\u2019re going to have some papers and postures available, we did touch on this in on the third quarter call. So expect some of it at AOS and again obviously longer randomized clinical data will take longer, but you are going to start to see that materialize throughout 2018. Bob Hopkins : Okay great, and then one for Glenn. Glenn two quick things; one, can you just give us an update on both Sage and Physio and kind of where we are right now given the issues that we that you had in 2017? And then also I was just wondering if you could quantify the EPS headwinds that are sort of one-time in nature in 2018, I know you talked about Intelius, but just if you could quantify the other kind of one-time EPS headwinds in 2018 that would be much appreciated?. Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : So as it relates to Sage and Physio as I mentioned in my script, over the course of Q4 we were able to go back to market with all major product families for them. So that was a big win, and we continue to see some ramping. I will also say that in Q4 the sales loss of $30 million was less than the sales loss we were anticipating. So that was a good sign too. I still anticipate a fair amount of ramping and working to do in 2018. In terms of Physio, Physio finished very strong in Q4 in fact their growth was accretive to the overall medical business. So we were very pleased with where Physio finished up the year. And then lastly on EPS, I did list out sort of some of those headwinds were and what we expected essentially the Spine market, I also talked about acquisitions that we have, Intelius we did quantify at $0.04, I think NOVADAQ we obviously said would be nominal, so there wouldn\u2019t be a really big impact on NOVADAQ. And then we didn\u2019t quantify any others. Katherine Owen : And Bob, we had Total Knee procedures in the fourth quarter on Mako is about 7,000. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Just to circle back on Medical and the strong performance there. Can you quantify it all how much Physio might have benefited from some of the competitor issues, you talked about that being very strong to finish out the year and I would guess that contributed to that strength? Katherine Owen : Yes. It\u2019s difficult to totaling that number, but clearly some of the competitive challenges did help our business overall. We have also launched some new products outside the U.S. that\u2019s contributing to the momentum. And it\u2019s been part of Stryker for well over a year now, so we\u2019d really integrated that organization and feel really good about the ability for them to drive the type of sales synergy that we had really expected at the time of the acquisition. So no doubt there is a benefit, but it\u2019s certainly not the only factor contributing to the strong performance. Chris Pasquale : Okay. And then. how you are thinking about the Spine business in 2018. You talked about some of the market challenges there, does that get better at some point or you thinking about portfolio additions that could help differentiate your back from competitors? Katherine Owen : So it\u2019s clear the market remains challenged when you look at the traditional spinal hardware business, our IVF business were seeing good growth, but that Spine market overall the conditions remain difficult. And I think we\u2019re just going to have to be cautious and conservative around our expectations for 2018, because the whole market is seeing some of these difficulties. So, we\u2019re going to continue to invest there and we\u2019re committed to the Spine market, we\u2019ve got a great organization there. Fortunately we\u2019re big enough company there; we can manage through some of these challenges and still market the necessary investments. But in terms of predicting a market rebound here improvement, it\u2019s just too challenging right now to have any certainty around that. So, until we see evidence to the contrary we\u2019re going to assume this year remains challenged. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is now open. Rick Wise : Thanks good afternoon everybody. Maybe start off with a couple of Mako questions. I mean obviously you\u2019ve got the TKA approval, how do we think about the potential opportunity should be dialing into Japan us an incremental Mako opportunity. How do we think about the next couple of years? Katherine Owen : So, I think for 2018 the focus for our organization right now is completing the upgrades of the majority of the systems that are in the field in the U.S. and there is a lot more that\u2019s gone into that and that should be done this year that will allow the organization that should focus strictly to new installations and as I mentioned we expect double digit growth there. We did sell the first robot into Japan, but we are not expecting the Total Knee application until later this year. So I would really look at that opportunity as after 2018. We\u2019ve got a lot of runway in front of us. We penetrated about 10% of our customer base and we expect the momentum only to continue to grow as we get into competitive accounts as we continue to gain more clinical data, more clinician support, getting into these academic centers is obviously a big win, because it underscores the clinical value here. So, we\u2019re going to keep with the game plan that\u2019s been working well and continue to execute on the Mako application and I think you should view Japan as something that\u2019s a longer term opportunity, an important one that probably not significant with respect to the revenue contribution for 2018. Rick Wise : And Kevin just thinking about M&A, you did what deal you are still adjusting NOVADAQ you got work to do, are you still on the M&A front, do you sense there is opportunity still what how are you thinking about capital deployment in 2018? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Thanks Rick. There is really no change to our capital allocations strategy. So acquisitions continue to be our preferred use of cash. The beauty of our decentralized business model is you can have a NOVADAQ going on with an endoscopy and then you can also have and Intelius going on with an instrument. So we have multiple divisions at their own business development teams that are constantly scaring the market for deals. We have a very good deal pipeline and that continues to be strong and that will be our favorite used. And so, I would say we\u2019re continuing to be very open for business on deals that are going to be value creating. And we continue to turn down most of the deals that we look at. And that\u2019s not new. So, this offer that we had in place now for 6, 7 years we expect to continue going forward. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kristen Stewart : Hi good evening, thanks for taking the question. One for Glenn and then one for Kevin. Glenn, just in terms of the liabilities, just thinking about those [indiscernible] hips and then also tax, how should one think about the timing of cash outflows over the next couple of years? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes Kristen the guidance is still forthcoming on exactly, especially the big liability which is the tax on accumulated earnings and profits, which is the $800 million liability that we booked. Right now the guidance says that\u2019s payable over 8 years. So, we expect that to spread very evenly over the 8 years, but we really won\u2019t see the liability decline or won\u2019t have definitive of guidance into the probably the latter half of this year. Kristen Stewart : Okay and then what about for the hip liability on rejuvenating maybe\u2026 Glenn Boehnlein : You know what we settled phase 2 this year and you would see that in our cash flow and as I think about the liability, it\u2019s generally winding down. And I think you\u2019ll see that in our 10-K disclosures. Kristen Stewart : Okay, so the cash flow on that should be winding out? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, it will merely the liability that\u2019s remaining that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then Kevin, how should we just think about to the extent that the organic growth guidance proves to be little bit on the conservative side has been for the last couple of years. Would you be inclined to reinvest some of the upside back into the business or lot of flow through at the bottom-line? Kevin Lobo : Kristen, I have just seen in prior years, we\u2019ve revised both our sales and EPS and in 2017 that was despite facing lot of challenges. We still did raise our EPS. You should look at 2018 no differently. So to the degree that top-line does come in stronger than we\u2019re currently targeting you should expect that it would translate to incremental leverage at the bottom-line. Now we make look to make some investments based on opportunities, but clearly we\u2019ve shown that we will met at the net leverage flow to the bottom-line and that would be our expectation again this year. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Bruce Nudell : Thank you for taking the question. Katherine, could you just quantify the number of TKA, Mako TKAs year-to-date and maybe comment a little bit about the U.S. ex-U.S. split as well as whether there is any ASP upside with the [indiscernible] of the Mako system, on a per case basis? Katherine Owen : Okay, so there, in terms of the total Mako knee procedures for last year it was just under 16,000, so 15,778 to be exact and about just a tad over 7,000 in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s all in all procedures on total knee procedures. There is some modest incremental cost associated with Mako, but I think I would call out as being meaningful. Bruce Nudell : Okay. And then\u2026 Kevin Lobo : Bruce you are asking just, I want to be clear Bruce are you asking about how many robots are equipped? Bruce Nudell : No, no I was asking, was the sleeve that protects the arm and the, instruments that sort of start? Kevin Lobo : Obviously there are disposables that come with it, we do sell those at pretty modest cost and are not high margin products. Bruce Nudell : Okay great, and then Kevin just to follow-up because they are not anniversary yet, could you give us a feel for the kind of intrusive growth rates of the NOVADAQ and Intelius franchises? Katherine Owen : So if we look at both of those, we expect if you take NOVADAQ first, we have fully integrated that. We did a lot of that heavy lifting in the fourth quarter of 2017. So we are well positioned now for NOVADAQ. We\u2019ve got the sales force fully aligned, the teams are fully integrated, we\u2019ve got aligned incentive. So that\u2019s really important in terms of making sure we don\u2019t have any internal competition or competing priorities. So they are well positioned at the start of this year to go after business and drive sales synergies and we expect it to be accretive to our overall revenue growth. We haven\u2019t put out targets for NOVADAQ, but certainly we expect in the hands of endo and with our combined sales force that would be accretive to our overall growth. And the similar expectation for Intelius we have an ENT presence; we had some product gaps in the portfolio. We get a well established sales force and that\u2019s certainly as we start to drive synergies in that and integrate it we need to close it first. But after we do that similar story as NOVADAQ should absolutely be accretive to our overall revenue growth and we\u2019ll be able to give some color commentary as we get further into that integration post closing. Kevin Lobo : Right and obviously both were separately traded public companies and you could see the results when they were reporting them before our acquisition growing north of 15% quarter-after-quarter and we would expect that we\u2019d continue to fuel their growth and then also be able to pull through additional revenue through Stryker. And as Katherine said, throughout the course of 2018 we\u2019ll provide update, so I am very pleased with the initial integration of NOVADAQ. And certainly getting the sales force all lined up early in 2018 as probably one of the fastest integrations we\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been at Stryker, so I really look forward to a good year in Endoscopy in 2018. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Raj Denhoy : Hi good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask a bit about the cementless knee trajectories, you noted 24% in the quarter, so two questions on that. One, what sort of price premium are you getting on cementless at this point and where do you think that penetration can top out you over time? Katherine Owen : So as Kevin mentioned, we exited the year at 24% penetration and it\u2019s obviously been ramping nicely, keep in mind though we did a very methodical slow launch initially. This was a paradigm shift for surgeons and we really wanted to make sure that they were seeing the results that would allow us to drive the type of uptake we\u2019re seeing now. But at 24% it\u2019s clearly resonating well with our surgeon base, it\u2019s tough to know how high it\u2019s going to go. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see its different than doing a hip there was a more concern initially, clearly getting the approval to do the Mako with the cementless knee is a big plus, because the great the precision of the cuts, the greater that press fit ability. So it\u2019s a plus, I would tell you we absolutely expected to continue to ramp up in greater penetration throughout 2018. So, we don\u2019t think we have topped this out. We do get a premium publicly roughly 10% for that product offering. Raj Denhoy : Okay, and then just follow-up, you mentioned the Mako, sort of the penetration of this in Mako, what percentage of Mako procedures are using cementless at this point? Katherine Owen : It\u2019s pretty small, so is there were some surgeons who are doing it prior to us getting the approval, but that was off-label and it was absolutely the minority and certainly nothing that we were promoting. We only just got the indication in the fourth quarter. So, the vast majority of the cementless needs that have been implanted has been done the traditional open surgery approach. Kevin Lobo : And we do believe the combination of robotics and 3D-printing is really powerful. Because born perhaps having a precise robotic assisted cut is really going to help enable that press fit just to emphasize Katherine\u2019s point, the two together we think our very synergistic and we do expect the cementless portion of Mako procedures to increase pretty dramatically. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Matthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Kevin or Katherine just thinking about the share gains in knees specifically, you mentioned what you're doing versus the market. But how do you think about keeping that share and necessarily in 2018 here seems like you've got the pretty good runway. But, heading into 2019 and beyond, is it the Mako angle that will help you keep share something else on the traditional side that will allow you to keep share. Just how do we think about you continuing this divergence away from the market as far as share gains go? Katherine Owen : I think the runway for Mako and the total knee application really goes far beyond 2018. So I think you'll hear a very similar focus from us as we go into 2019, as we know that we've only penetrated about 10% of our customer base. We've just started to gather the clinical data that we think will really help drive future waves of adoption and so there's a lot of runway we would call this a multi-year story. We're very excited about 3D printing, our dedicated facility in Ireland what we've been able to do in recent years with those -- that product offering in knees and spine. And so 3D printing is going to absolutely remain a big part of the story for our reconstructive group and for Stryker more broadly. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. And then Kevin I ask you about this every single quarter, but in looking at the trauma and extremities performance that it's the best that you've seen in the last 13 quarters. That business is now getting to be bigger than hips, it's getting to be as big as knees. Can you talk a little bit about the acceleration there? And then, by my math your 17%, 18% market share in trauma and extremities where can that go over the next several years, can you be a third of this market? Kevin Lobo : Thanks for the question. We're delighted with the performance of our trauma and extremities business and as you know this has not been a one quarter story. This has been about a four or five year story once we really filled out our product offering. Our foot and ankle has course been a real engine of growth where we're growing significantly above the market in that substantial-segment we're starting to grow in upper extremities. So our shoulder business had a very good year in 2017. It's still a very small market share from a small base we are growing very well. That still has significant room for us to grow. We now have a primary shoulder; we have a reverse shoulder; we have a fracture system, but we still don't have a full offering be it a short stem or stemless. But, we have the core offering to really start to grow within shoulder. That's certainly part of the story converting full accounts has been really an engine of growth in the last couple of years. So four, five years ago, we were we were making headway in foot and ankle and a few other areas, but now we have the full offering and can convert entire accounts. So we're delighted with our focus on dedicated sales reps, dedicated management, dedicated marketing, dedicated business development R&D that business unit dedication has clearly been working and we expect it to continue. Can we continue to grow at such a divergence from the market? I'm not sure. But, do expect to continue to outpace the market. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good afternoon. Kevin, one of the quick question on your revenue guidance for 2018, you're guiding to 6% to 6.5%. I know it's a very strong guide but in 2017 you put up 7% growth. And I know some businesses have tough comps, but there's an easier comp with Sage; there's going to be an easier comp created by Puerto Rico and the hurricanes. So, is there anything that you want to call out that that's worrying you for 2018 or are you feeling at this point of the year, it's just better to be conservative? And then, I had a question on international knees and hips. Kevin Lobo : So look it is early in the year, we do have big comps in a number of areas. I think when you look at our product cycles, we have a number of product cycles that are really starting to accelerate. And then, you have something like 1588, which is not really it sort of in the later stages of its cycle. So there isn't anything really big that I would call out. I think growing north of 6% on over $12 billion of revenue is a pretty good guide. But no specific worries or causes for concern. And if we continue with the kind of momentum we have certainly we'd look to update our guidance at some point in the year. But every year starts out and there's things that are going to happen that you don't know. And we feel this is a very appropriate guide. But, the reason for narrowing the guide a little bit in past years we've had a wider guide on sales. I really feel good about the balance that we have across our divisions and the balance across our geographies. It's probably the most balanced position we've been in since I've been at Stryker. And so that causes us to feel a lot more confident certainly on the lower end of the range than we have in the past. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then, let me just follow up with the performance of international knees and hips. It lagged U.S. and I know you called out Europe for a good performance but one of your competitors talked about pricing pressure in India, pricing pressure in China; China reducing inventory levels. Did you guys see that in the fourth quarter? And if so, when does it resolve? Thanks. A - Glenn Boehnlein Sure. We definitely saw the same issues. India is of course a dramatic knee cut -- price cut of around 70% which is government mandated, so everybody felt that. Fortunately for Stryker, we have a pretty small market share in India. So while it did hurt us, it probably didn't hurt us to the same degree that it hurt others. China is a bit of a different story where you are moving to the two invoice policy and there are regional tendering going on. It's not quite as dramatic an impact as it is in India. And we are very encouraged about our China business. We have a new leader that we put in place in China in Q4. He's strengthening the team and feeling very good about our prospects in China. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One on Neurotech, one on Robotics. Surprisingly, no questions yet on Neurotech, which I think was your fastest growing business in the fourth quarter. So Kevin maybe you can talk a little bit about what drove that. How much ischemic stroke is contributing to that and the outlook there given all the positive data we've just recently seen in the updated guidelines. And I had one follow up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I know we were really excited, our neurovascular business has performed extremely well in the past four years. And ischemic stroke is clearly one of the engines of growth. We're thrilled that the treatment guidelines have been extended from six hours and now up to 24 hours. Some of the studies are 16 hours summer 24 hours that extension certainly should help expand the market. You're also seeing other clinical studies come out around aspiration and so competitive activity certainly is intensifying in the space. But we believe it's a big market expansion story that will continue in the years ahead. We also had very good growth in our other two Neurotech businesses, our CMS business had double-digit growth and that's been a fantastic smaller business for us, but really steady performer. And our neuro-powered instruments as -- we launched the signature power drills that are just performing exceptionally well. So really all three legs of the Neurotech stool have been performing very, very well for us. But the biggest clear upside as you think about the next five years is ischemic stroke. And we are just at the early stages of that market. And every participant is going to be benefiting as that is a market expansion story. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then, Kevin one strategic question for you. Given the success you're having with Mako what's your interest in Robotics outside of orthopedics i.e., for soft tissue. It would seem to make some strategic sense for Stryker given your other offerings. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. Look we really have a huge opportunity in front of us in hard tissue. So I would tell you that our focus for the short-term, medium-term at least medium term maybe even long-term is going to be in hard tissue. We're really focused on hips and knees right now. There are other applications that you can imagine and other joints even within knees you could imagine moving towards bicruciate retaining and other types of procedures even within the existing joints. So the runway is significant in hard tissue that is going to be our main focus for the short-and medium term. One day could there be something in soft tissues perhaps, but it really isn't a major focus within our company right now. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter particularly in knees. Can we step back for a moment and when you talk about the halo effect of Mako, we're looking at your whole recon business really moving forward nicely. What is that halo effect? Is it just for knees or how broad is it spreading? Katherine Owen : Hi, Joanne. I would say right now it is primarily knees. It's being able to get into competitive accounts where we either have no market share or where our market share is well below the average. And the first thing surgeons do or adopting Makos start to use our Triathlon knee system and so that's all either new or incremental revenue. And then, as they start to use Mako, it's obviously a closed system. And then, the sales force -- once the sales rep gets in, they're going to sell the entire portfolio. And so, I would say the majority of the halo effect that we referenced is more around the knee business than anything else right now. Kevin Lobo : But I am excited about the launch of our Trident 2 hip cup. So we are in limited launch last couple of years and we're now moving into full launch. And that hip cup its 3D printed hip cup would really that combined with Mako will be very compelling. Most surgeons as you know are happy with their hip outcomes. So they not necessarily believing that the robotic assistance will really help them until they try it. And then, they realize it can be very powerful. So I'm hopeful that the launch of the new cup will also create a little bit of extra energy around hips with Mako. But the killer application which we've said really from day one from the time we acquired Mako was going to be total knee given the level of dissatisfaction, the challenge of balancing a knee and everything that that Mako provides really does help the surgeon and the feedback that we're getting from them is, it really does produce better outcomes for them. Obviously, we're in the process of trying to quantify that and trying to produce the evidence for that. But as we've done in the partial knee and shown that evidence that's our intention with the total knee. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. That's helpful. And as a follow up question, big picture orthopedics, volume seem to have a tough quarter in third quarter came back fourth quarter. Are we starting to see more and more procedures shoveled onto -- shoveled is a wrong word, but moved onto sort of the ends -- the bookends of the year? I mean is that, is that how we should lay out our quarters at least in recon for the 2018 timeframe? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yes. I don't think you should assume any big divergence from historical trends. Q4 is seasonally strong; Q3 was a particularly funky quarter in 2017 with three major hurricanes that clearly had disruption for us and others. And we have big market shares in those areas. So I wouldn't read too much into Q3 volumes being lighter, I think it was just one of those quarters where there was some specific events that took place. And again, as we mentioned we're not expecting anything unique in the first quarter. Everybody knows where we've got tough comparisons. There's one less selling day as we mentioned U.K. has got some challenges. But every quarter always has some type of challenge. I don't think you should be assuming any big difference when you look at the quarterly growth rates other than keeping an eye out obviously for year-over-year comps. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Question on margins, I think in the past you've talked about that 30 to 50 basis points annually and if we look past sort of the noise currently. What needs to happen to hit the higher end of the range given the portfolio changes you guys have made? Is it simply a function of top line growth or are there some longer lived programs that we haven't spent time on today that you guys can point to that will release more leverage over time? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hi. That's a good question. As I think about 30 to 50 basis points and I look at what programs are covered within that. I don't think there's an opportunity to accelerate those programs to drive faster savings. I do think that in programs like our indirect spend program we are maximizing the amount of savings that we can drive. We'll enter a new phase for HR and finance shared services in the upcoming year that will contribute more to that equation. So I really think about it in terms of delivering top line at the upper end of the range will also provide sort of more significant drop through and that will increase the up margin range to closer to 50 basis points. Isaac Ro : Okay, great. And then, maybe a follow up on Intelius. It's obviously interesting new therapy there and I'm interested in the competitive landscape and how you guys plan to differentiate as you guys unless you take ownership of that asset? Thank you. Katherine Owen : I think the big opportunity there is, we had a presence in the ENT market. We've been in that space for a number of years within our instruments division. But it wasn't big enough to really carve it out and establish as a standalone ENT group. This really is a catalyst to do that. It's been a very effective strategy for us. We've done it numerous times within our instruments group. We believe focus drives results. So using this to really fill out the portfolio of ENT products we are going to have a very comprehensive bag. We're buying an established sales force, we're going to integrate it with our own talent, invest in it invest in that dedicated sales force. This is very core to Stryker's overall strategy and we believe as we move through that process we'll be able to drive sales synergies. So it's going to be focus being able to establish a dedicated sales force. We have terrific leadership within our instruments group and now we'll have a comprehensive product portfolio to really compete very effectively in the ENT space. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a strong finish to 2017. So a lots really been asked, but I just wanted to kind of take a step back on the MedSurg side and just maybe you can provide your perspective on the hospital CapEx environment and just where we are from an investment perspective there? And then, any additional updates as far as the product cycles across both instruments as well as endoscopy with the 1588 camera there? That would be very helpful. Katherine Owen : Sure. We too are really very upbeat around the CapEx environment. You saw another strong quarter within our medical which is our most capital intensive business for their core bedding structure business. We also saw a great quarter for physio, which is a large capital component. So overall that market seems the very least stable. But clearly, I think what our results are reflecting is that where we're taking market share within those segments. If you look at endoscopy they have just had the second year anniversary of the 1588 launch so that was obviously a highly successful launch for that group. I think if you think about 2018, it's really going to be about driving as NOVADAQ synergies as we have now -- as we mentioned earlier integrated the sales force and there's a lot of opportunity. So for the extend 1588 and get into new accounts through our combined sales presence. Instruments -- the big products launch right now is system A. We're really pleased with that. You could clearly see it with the results, double-digit growth or instruments in the quarter and that's in the first year of launch. So they've got some good runway ahead of them and certainly it'll be one of the standouts for that division within -- for 2018. Glenn Boehnlein : And if you look at our MedSurg business, which we rarely get a lot of questions about. Just look at the absolute performance, the growth in the quarter, the growth in the full year, the growth the last three years. I mean this is becoming a really high growth segment of the company and very consistent year after. Now, it does vary from division to division based on the timing of product cycles, but through the acquisitions that we're bringing into the MedSurg group. We really are turning that full group into a growth engine for the overall company. And it was consistent before but now with the outperformance that we have versus the market is pretty meaningful. Kyle Rose : Thank you very much for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Your line is now open. Josh Jennings : Good evening. Thanks a lot. I was hoping to just circle back on margin guidance for 2018. I think you laid out absorption of Intelius and NOVADAQ potentially margin dilutive same level of spend into the CTG program and potentially into the midpoint of that 30 to 50. Should we be thinking about a margin outperformance in 2018 within that range towards the top end of that 30 to 50 range or is there a comparison issue that we should be thinking about as well? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, I think you know where we are in the year and providing guidance at the beginning of the year. I think it's more safe to probably target the middle of that range than the upper end of that range. As I said as we look to sales performance and things like Sage coming back and ramping up, bringing our Puerto Rico facility back up to 100%. Those things will give us more confidence that we potentially could be to the upper end of that range. Josh Jennings : I guess maybe just trying to be clear about the headwinds that you're facing with the acquisitions same level of spend. Is that 30 to 50 actually a higher range considering the headwinds you're facing or there is a comparison from 2017 offset those headwinds? Kevin Lobo : Yes. No, really the comparison from 2017 is a pretty direct offset to the same headwind. So we really are bracketing the 30 to 50 basis points about margin improvement. Josh Jennings : Okay. Thanks for that. And one other follow up with the Mako question and then just in terms of systems place. Are you getting any penetration into ambulatory surgical centers, knee replacements are off the inpatient only list? Our understanding is that, ASCs still can't get reimbursed from Medicare, but also any comments here in terms of how you are positioned for the potential eventuality of recon procedures moving into those facilities. Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine Owen : Sure. You are correct around the reimbursement and not being available in ambulatory surgery center. We have had to make replacement sales into that setting, but the vast majority is still in the hospital setting. We do think you're going to see a shift of procedures, but it's going to be gradual. You really have to target the ideal patient and a lot of these patients have challenges associated with other conditions that that don't suit them well to that setting. And I think the industry is still working through how to make sure they've got the right protocols in place. So short answer, yes, we have sold some, but the vast majority are in the hospital setting and I think that will be the trend this year as well. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. Your line is open. Kaila Krum : Hey guys. Thanks for taking our question. So a follow-up on your response to Larry's question on Robotics. It sounds like you still have a lot of opportunity in total knees and other applications within orthopedics, we would imagine spine. I mean can you just walk us through sort of that what that development process would entail to extend Mako into those other categories just in theory? Katherine Owen : Yes. At this point it's really too early for us to give a whole lot of visibility into the Mako pipeline. We have a lot of work to do given we've penetrated about 10% of our customers for the total knee. And that's where we want our team's focus to be. We obviously have some R&D programs underway. You've heard Kevin talk about opportunities in other joints and we do think that eventually could include spine, but it's a little early right now and we really want to make sure the focus is and truly optimizing the opportunity given the size of it for the total knee. But clearly opportunity longer term in other joints. Kaila Krum : Thanks Catherine. And then, just on spine, can you guys talk a little bit about what sort of foundational efforts you're putting into place today. Just to help recover the growth profile there. I mean have you found this business to have become even less of a priority just in terms of near term investment given some of the market growth headwinds we've seen in that area? Kevin Lobo : No. Actually, we on the contrary, this is a business that really responds well to innovation. We've seen that ourselves when we've had the right innovation that we bring to the market if we grow and we grow faster than the market. We launched our second Tritanium products cervical, in the fourth quarter we launched a new pedicle screw system called Serrato in the second half of the year, we're seeing a very nice up tick from those products. So if anything we're actually continuing to invest in even increasing the amount of R&D investment in the spine business. We're very committed to it long-term. We believe it's a very important. It's the largest orthopedic market. There are huge unmet needs. It's connected as you see with 3D printing, we're able to leverage that technology across not just spine, but also hips and knees. So there's a lot of sharing of technologies there. It's part of the Neurotech group of many hospitals and part of their service line. So we remain committed to it. We're investing in innovation; innovation does drive growth, but we have to be realistic, it is a tough market. The market conditions aren't great, but we are very committed to the business and we really believe innovation is the way to continue to grow in spine. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Craig Bijou : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones on Mako. I wanted to talk about or I wanted to ask about the 20% of competitive surgeons who are using Triathlon for the first time. I think that's a new metric that you guys have provided. So just wanted to get your sense for when you talked about taking market share, the 100s of basis points? How does that 20% compared to your expectations? And then, where can we see that going forward? Katherine Owen : Yes. I think overall we've been really pleased with the launch and the ramp that we're seeing both in getting into competitive accounts as well as being able to upgrade robots in the field and install new robots. And so it's the combination, you're growing 3.5x the overall market clearly that's coming from both getting into accounts that have never had Triathlon as well as other competitive accounts in our own customers. And so it's very difficult to break that apart in terms of the market share gains. It's a combined effect and I would say in terms of expectations we're just really pleased with how 2017 unfolded. And we've got a lot of work to do to continue the trajectory we expect to perform out for 2018. Craig Bijou : Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2018 results will be held on April 26. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

My name is Brian, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO, and Katherine Owen, Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. Our Q1 performance exceeded our expectations and positions us well for another strong year in 2018. Organic sales growth was an impressive 7% despite one less selling day in the quarter versus 2017 and was well balanced across businesses and geographies. There were a number of standout performances in the quarter as we innovate through internal investments, effectively running our sales and marketing offense and execute on sales and acquisitions. Neurotechnology and Spine led the way, delivering 10% increase in organic sales, powered by Neurovascular growth of 20%, reflecting strength in both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. MedSurg had strong organic growth of roughly 8% as Endoscopy continued to post strong double-digit growth in its core business and also had good performance from NOVADAQ. We are pleased with the speed of integration since we closed last November, and our unified sales force is driving share gains across the portfolio. Entellus, which closed in March, is also off to a strong start and is reported within Neurotechnology. The early success of these deals underscores the benefit of prioritizing M&A, which has become a core strength for Stryker in both identifying attractive targets and executing post closing. Turning to Ortho, sales were up nearly 5% organically, led once again by strong growth in trauma and knees. And Mako had another strong quarter with a significant increase in new robot installations year-over-year. Geographically, we had strong performances in Japan, South Pacific and Canada while Europe was a bit softer than the recent trends owing to the bed blockages in the UK. And emerging markets had a solid quarter, posting double-digit growth. The robots top line coupled with the benefits tied to our cost transformation for growth, which we call CTG, drove a meaningful year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 25%. As Glenn will discuss in more detail, the previously announced adoption of certain accounting guidance changes had some benefit to our operating margin. But after adjusting for this impact, our adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year despite acquisition dilution in 2018. I'd like to take a moment to thank Lonny Carpenter and his team for their efforts in driving CTG, which is now beginning to translate into improved operating margin performance. As many of you know, after 30 stellar years at Stryker, Lonny recently announced his plans to retire. Lonny has made too many contributions to Stryker over three decades to attempt to cover them here, but his commitment to driving CTG and its sustainable impact on our margins is certainly one of the thumbprints he will leave on our company. Turning back to the P&L. With a strong top line, we continue to support investments in sales, marketing and R&D that will help deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. Our operating margin expansion coupled with the benefits from foreign currency and tax resulted in adjusted per share earnings increase of 13.5% to $1.68, above the high end of our targeted range. Based on our Q1 outperformance and the outlook for the remainder of the year, we have raised our expectations for both full year organic sales growth and adjusted EPS. We're also well positioned to deliver a minimum of 30 basis points to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on Mako. In the first quarter, we installed a total of 28 robots globally with 24 in the U.S. compared to a total of 18 in the year-ago quarter, of which 11 were in the U.S. Upgrade to robots in the field for the total knee application continued, reaching approximately 70% by the end of Q1. We remain on track to have the vast majority of the robots in the U.S. upgraded by Q3. Of the robots installed in Q1, over 50% were in competitive accounts with Stryker either had no knee market share or our share is well below our average level. During the quarter, we trained 160 surgeons approximately on Total Knee, bringing the total number of surgeons trained since launch to roughly 1,000. Looking at U.S. procedures, in Q1, Mako Total Knee procedures approximated 8,200, which compares to roughly 1,100 in the first quarter of 2017 and also up sequentially from roughly 7,150 in Q4 with all Mako procedures topping 15,200, Total Knee represents the majority at roughly 55%. Utilization rates increased roughly 80% year-over-year with the robot in nearly 400 hospitals in the U.S. Of the roughly 4,000 hospitals in the U.S. with orthopedic practices, we estimate long-term roughly 50% are candidates for at least one robot, suggesting considerable runway for continued adoption. We remain focused on our strategy of selling new robots, upgrading customers and collecting clinical data. We believe we are particularly well positioned in robotics for orthopedics, given our considerable head start, established implant and capital sales forces, expertise in blade and navigation technologies to our Instruments division and ongoing investments in R&D towards new application and next-generation technologies. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. Today, I'll focus my commented on our first quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. We have provided our detailed financial results in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, which had an approximately 1% negative impact on growth. Keep in mind that selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.6% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 2.5% impact on sales. U.S. and international organic sales growth at 7% continues to demonstrate strong momentum, and both geographies were impacted from one less selling day. In the U.S., there were strong performances across Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology. International sales growth demonstrated solid gains in Japan, Canada, Australia and emerging markets. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.68 increased 13.5% from the prior year, reflecting strong drop-through on sales growth combined with good operating expense performance. In line with our previous expectations, our first quarter EPS was favorably impacted approximately $0.02 by foreign currency exchange rates, including translational and transactional impacts. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency and organic growth of 4.7%, including organic growth of 5.8% in the U.S. This performance was highlighted by strong performances in knees of 5.5%, and Trauma & Extremities of 9%. The primary drivers of performance in the quarter included continued demand for our Mako TKA knee platform, 3D-printed products in our foot and ankle portfolio. Internationally, Orthopaedics delivered organic growth of 2.5%, which reflects softer performance in Europe. MedSurg continued to have solid performances across all businesses in the quarter with constant-currency growth of 9.1% and organic gains of 7.8%, which included a 7.6% increase in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.7%. This included the negative impact of supplies issues related to our Puerto Rico facility ramp-up. These supply issues should moderate in the second quarter and did not affect Instruments' Power Tools business, which had double-digit growth during the quarter, led by the strength of its System 8 and Micro Power product lines. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 16%. This reflects strong demand for its video platform, general surgery, rooms and lights and sports medicine products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 4.8%, driven by strong performance of its core bed and power cot products as well as its physio business. Medical Sage business continues to recover from last year's product issues and is back in market with a complete product portfolio. We expect Sage to return to growth in the third quarter. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 8.8%, which reflects strong sales in Japan, Australia and Canada. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant-currency growth of 13.5% and organic growth of 10.1%. This growth reflects continued demand for our Neurotech products, offset by softness in our core Spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted organic growth of 14.7% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our coil, ischemic stroke, CMS and our powered instruments and accessories for neuro, spine and ENT. Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see market softness as well as low-double digit price declines across core product lines, with the exception of our Tritanium implant products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 14.2%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand across most geography for our Neurotech products. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. As noted in the press release for Q4, the adoption of ASC-606 primarily had the impact of reclassifying certain costs from SG&A to sales. As such, all the following references to basis point improvements are net of this impact to enable an apples-to-apples comparison. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% improved nominally from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year first quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by productivity, efficiency and foreign exchange gains, offset by business mix and price. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was 25 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth, or CTG program, offset by negative impact from acquisitions and continued planned investments in our CTG program, our ERP project and certain selling investments in our Mako business. R&D spending increased $12 million and was 6.3% of sales. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 25% of sales, which was 50 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter, which was inclusive of negative 25 basis points related to acquisitions. Our operating margin reflects good leverage and continued operational savings, offset by key investment. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our full-year commitment of driving a minimum of 30 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in our op margin. Now, looking at other income, expense and taxes, other expenses decreased primarily due to favorable interest income. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1% reflects an underlying operating tax rate of 17.5%, primarily offset by a higher-than-expected benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 55% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.9 billion. This increase from year-end 2017 primarily relates to a $600 million April maturity that was financed in March. Turning to cash flow, our first quarter cash from operations was approximately $297 million. During the quarter, we completed a $300 million share repurchase, which will offset the impact of dilution in 2018. And now I will discuss our second quarter guidance. We raised our expectation of organic annual sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2018. As a reminder, Q2 has one more selling day as compared to 2017, and Q3 and Q4 have the same number of selling days. Given our first quarter performance, continued momentum and continued favorability related to foreign exchange, assuming rates stay at the current levels, we now believe that our adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $7.18 to $7.25 for the full year. For the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75. This guidance, full year and quarter, includes anticipated impacts from the aforementioned business investments, the previously announced $0.04 of dilution related to Entellus, net foreign currency exchange favorability, including both translational and transactional impacts, consistent with our first quarter results and expectations at the beginning of the year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong start to the year. First question I wanted ask was just on the knee business. And this might be a little hard for you guys to tease out, given how well you're doing across the board. But it definitely looks like, when you look at J&J's numbers and Zimmer's numbers and your numbers, like the knee market slowed in the first quarter. And I was wondering if that's something that you guys kind of saw in your surgeries, or just wondering if you could offer a comment on that. And I recognize it might be little harder for you to tease out, given that you're taking share and doing so well, but just curious, if you had any thoughts on the knee market this quarter? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. I think, overall, there was a sense that procedures were softer in the first quarter. How much of that was the flu season or other factors, it's tough to know because we have such a long history in the reconstructive market of seeing quarter-to-quarter variability. Some quarters coming in stronger than expected for no explicable reason, and some quarters like this that are a bit softer. We're not seeing anything that suggests underlying demand has changed in some fundamental way. I think this is just one of those quarters where maybe there was a bigger seasonality impact. Our focus really is, though, on market share gains. It's by far the biggest driver of our performance. And when we look at the history here, 2016, we grew 400 basis points ahead of the market in the U.S. in knees. Last year, we grew 600 basis points. And on the first quarter, it looks like we're growing at least 600 basis points faster than the market. So that's really our focus here than quarter-to-quarter variability, because again we're not seeing anything in the market or hearing anything from our customers or our sales force that suggests underlying demand or trend in the recon market is changed. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So, I guess, just as a follow-up to that, and just to make sure, there's nothing on pricing as it relates to knees. I just wanted to follow up on that. And then I guess, the other question I had was just for Kevin, more broadly, when you look at the state of your business and the really strong growth you guys have been putting up as an organization, maybe you could just comment from a big picture perspective on sort of the durability of the growth outlook for the business on the top line? Just some broad thoughts for the rest of 2018 on sort of durability of growth. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Bob. I'd tell you first on the pricing, there was really no change on our hip and knee business. Very consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years, the same underlying trend. And as it relates to our sales growth, I think the durability is reflected, and this is our 20th consecutive quarter where we've grown organic sales over 5%. So, we're growing sales on top of strong growth from the prior years, year after year after year. So that, I would say, is something we've been demonstrating very consistently. The fact that we're raising our full year guidance to 6.5% to 7% after one quarter, normally we kind of wait for the second quarter before we raise guidance, but it came in so strong and really it so well balanced across our different businesses and regions that it gives me a lot of confidence that we can continue to perform at the high-end of medtech. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Two quick questions for me. The first \u2013 first of all, congrats on another 8% underlying growth quarter, guys. But margins, Kevin, the real standout this quarter. So, just given the dilution with Entellus, how should we think about the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of guidance for the remainder of the year? And just more broadly, where do you think the company is now on this margin journey you've been discussing now the last six or eight quarters? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: (00:19:11) answer this. Go ahead, Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. David, we continually reiterate our 30 basis points to 50 basis points and our confidence relative to that. And I think this quarter we're starting to see some of the CTG efforts that we put in place to really turn positive. And so, that's been a good bright spot. We've also sort of instilled the mindset within our organization and incentive plans and things like that, that drive a focus on operating margin. I think \u2013 if you look at some of our other programs, our indirect spend management has turned positive. Plant network optimization has turned positive. And we've also completed our sort of our geographic market rationalizations. So, that's an expense that we won't have. I think, on the flip side of that, we are going to continue to see investment in ERP greater this year than we saw last year. And we'll also continue to invest in our product lifecycle management program at a higher level than we had invested last year. So I think, given that acquisitions were about a 25 basis points drag on our op margin, I think delivering the 50 basis points, I feel good about, and it gives me confidence going into the rest of the year. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And as I said in the opening comments, I would expect a minimum of 30 basis points to 50 basis points. So, I think that's the first time we've used the word minimum. And that's really on the strength of a strong first quarter and strong underlying performance and expectations for the rest of the year. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. It's actually the second time, Kevin. The first time is the minimum 9%. Can't forget that. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: The floor. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's the floor. Second question for me is just, we actually (20:56) with your math. We think you took 7 points a share \u2013 or grew 7 points faster than market fourth quarter, 7 points faster than market this quarter. Obviously, Mako was a driver there. So, I noticed that Mako placements reaccelerated this quarter, strongest quarter in several. I'm just wondering how much of this is just traction inflection in the market versus sort of the incremental transition away from upgrades to de novo system placements? Thanks so much. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think a couple of factors. It's the same sales force that's doing installs and that is doing upgrades. So, it's always a balance in any given quarter. And based on our customer needs, and where there might be in the Q, those numbers move back and forth as we had more upgrade focused in the fourth quarter. And we're also seeing continued inroads into competitive accounts. It's gone from 40% to now over 50% of the robots are going into competitive accounts. So I think it's clear we're seeing continued strong momentum and a lot of runway given the number of hospitals that don't yet have a robot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. First is a clarification, Glenn. From the schedules in the release, it looks like operating margin improved about 70 basis points, and you're talking about 50 basis points. So, what's the additional adjustment that you're making there? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. The adjustment relates to ASC 606 rev recognition guidance. And if you think about the FASB announced those changes which impacts sort of the timing of revenue recognition, but it also provided some more clarity regarding the presentation of certain costs. So, in 2018, we reclassified certain costs from selling up into sales. And if you think about looking at 2017, that adjustment would have been about $28 million per quarter reclassified from selling up into sales. And so, by taking account of that adjustment, that's how you get your 50 basis points. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : That's helpful. Thanks. And then, can you just talk a little bit more, guys, about the strength in Endoscopy this quarter. You highlighted a number of things across that portfolio, but that was a particularly strong performance. Was there anything in particular there that drove that upside? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: It's really across the board strength in the entire Endo portfolio. Clearly, the 1588 camera has been a tremendous success, but it's \u2013 as Glenn commented, it is booms and lights, it's sports medicine, that whole Endo business is just seeing really, really good momentum, and very excited too about the NOVADAQ acquisition. That integration has gone faster than we anticipated, and it's certainly setting them up for continued momentum there now that we've got a combined sales force in place. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Kevin, just wondering if you could maybe opine a little bit on the seasonality of Orthopaedics procedures. Not only have a few data points, it seems like there was a little bit of a first quarter seasonality and there's a lot of noise in the quarter this year with flu and all that. But just would appreciate your current view as we think about seasonality, not just this year, but heading into the end of this year and into the next year. Do you think this effect across the industry could pick up? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I'll go back to what Katherine said in one of the previous questions and just say we see quarter to quarter variations. If you look at sort of rolling four quarters, we don't see anything that's suggesting some fundamental shift in the market. So, I think let's see how the second and third quarter play out, but this is not unusual. We had a pretty strong fourth quarter, a little bit softer first quarter. We've seen that movie multiple times over the past five years. So, I still see the market as very stable from a procedural standpoint and we're really much more focused on driving our growth through share gains. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. And then on the margin side, obviously, that's something that I think a lot of people have been looking for and it's good to see the improvement. Are there any one-timers there that you would say are \u2013 that were especially helpful this quarter that maybe don't repeat sequentially as you think about the summer months here? Thank you. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. There really aren't any onetime benefit items that are flowing through. I mean, really the onetime items are really related to sort of acquisitions, which is a negative. The other things I mentioned, especially those things that are related to sort of our CTG program and ERP, and direct spending and indirect spending, those are all things that should be recurring as the year goes forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Kevin, it sounds like Mako is about 10% of the hospitals. Can you hear me? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: We can. Yeah. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Oh, great. And Zimmer is going to be coming out with a robot. Smith & Nephew has another robot, of course. How are you thinking about kind of the blocking action of just getting as much insulation as you can, as quickly as you can? Because it would seem that once a robot system is installed, you don't want to have to learn on a second one. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Obviously, we have a big head start, and what we want is all our robots to be very productive. So, the idea is just going in and placing a bunch of robots is really not our strategy. We look for surgeons that are really champions that they're going to use the robot. They're going to have a robots program. So, we're not doing bulk sales, we're not doing C-Suite sales, we're making sure that every robot is very productive. The interest level is extremely high and we do plan to take advantage of our head start, but our focus is really making sure we get value for the robots. And Katherine talked about the kind of price points that we're getting for the sales of the robots, but we really want productive robots, and if you have a robot that's collecting dust, that's of no good to anybody. So, right now, that's what our main focus is on, that's why we give you the procedure count every single quarter, so you can see that we're ramping up procedures on the robot. But we do plan to take advantage of our head start, and we're really less concerned about what other competitive offerings there are and more concerned about making sure that we drive value with our offering. Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And my follow-up is, I was looking at our model today and one of the things about Sage that struck me is how U.S.-centric it is. Could you opine upon the ex-U.S. opportunity of that seemingly very interesting set of products? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. They were very, very heavily U.S.-focused, and we've now started to go direct. Certainly, we see Europe as a good market for that. Australia will also be a very good market. It just takes a bit of time, because we're choosing not to go with the distribution route, which Sage had done outside the United States. So, it's taken us a little bit of time to clean up the prior distributor arrangements and we do have a plan to go direct. But certainly, the value proposition is compelling and we do see significant runway, and that was one of the features of that acquisition was making sure that we take advantage of the OUS opportunities. Obviously, we dealt quite a blow last year from a regulatory standpoint and we had to get these products back on the market. So, the U.S. maintained our total attention as we got the products back on the market, but we certainly see significant runway outside the United States. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Your line is now open. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe one on guidance to start with, it looks like the EPS range was raised by $0.08, and just given the strength in Q1 and it looks like FX was another incremental $0.08 better versus the last guide. I was just trying to understand \u2013 am I missing something or why wasn't the EPS guidance maybe better? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. First of all, the guidance on FX is pretty much in line with where our expectations were in our fourth quarter call. So, that's in line with what we thought would be. I would tell you that as far as it relates to effective tax rate, we are still maintaining our guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%. So, the benefit we saw in Q1 is really probably sort of a timing benefit we think to the overall rate. And as I think about sort of our Q1 performance and sort of where the additional EPS came from, probably 75% of it came from stronger top line and op margin expansion. And I think the full year guidance reflects sort of that Q1 performance as well as sort of our expectations for a stronger top line and continued op margin expansion. Keep in mind that even at the low end of our guidance, our new guidance range, we're still forecasting double-digit EPS growth. So, I think we're in a good spot at the end of the first quarter here. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : That's helpful. And just maybe one clarification on margins. If I had to \u2013 I think the Street models didn't have the 606 reduction, right? So, if I had to do an apples-to-apples comparison on the margins, I'm getting to gross margin of 65.7% and op margins of 24.8%. Does that sound right to you guys? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: No. You know what, you probably should follow up with IR after the call and they'll help you with those numbers. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. So, the Neurovascular growth of 20% was quite impressive. I guess my question is, how much of a benefit are we seeing from the new guidelines, which expand the treatment window for ischemic stroke? And what was that number? I don't know if you've given that number in the past. How did that compare to Q4, and just Kevin, the sustainability of that growth? And I have one follow-up. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We really are seeing very strong growth in both the hemorrhagic and the ischemic markets. It's coiled, it's the ischemic expansion, there's no doubt that the new guidelines absolutely help, because there's clearly a longer window now to treat patients. It's difficult to tease that actual impact out, but what we have historically seen is when this positive clinical data comes out, it certainly helps the market. We don't break it out, but I can tell you growth was very robust in both hemorrhagic and ischemic. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. And as it relates to the second part of your question, for Neurotechnology, we have three businesses within there. So, we have our craniomaxillofacial business, the neurovascular, which is the biggest, and then we have the NSE business, which is the powered instruments as well as accessories from our instruments division. All three of those have been strong double-digit performers. Neurovascular was a strong double-digit performer all of last year. 20% is a little bit of a high watermark. And whether that can continue to be at 20%, we'll see over the next few quarters, but it will continue to be strong double-digit growth as it has been for the past few years. Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then for my follow-up on Physio-Control. What was the year-over-year growth there? And are you guys seeing any benefit from the Philips consent decree? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So, since the middle of last year, we've had very strong growth in Physio-Control. Part of that might be owing to the Philips issues, but we've also made some management changes and we're thrilled with the leadership that we're displaying there. We had double-digit growth in the first quarter in Physio-Control. As you know, Sage had negative growth. So in spite of Sage's negative growth in the quarter, medical posted a very respectable growth performance, and Physio was one of the reasons delivering double-digit growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our first question is related to the hips. Are you seeing a similar trend as what you saw with knees with still strong fundamentals but quarterly-over-quarter variability? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I think that's very reflective of what we're seeing in the market right now. Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. And then just one follow-up with the Orthopaedics. You guys mentioned the flu season potentially having an impact in the first quarter in Europe. Is there any numbers to quantify that? Or is it just a general trend? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I think it's just a general trend. We know there was some bed locking (34:02) in the U.K. owing to flu, but it's impossible to tease that out with any semblance of accuracy. I wouldn't say we saw some big impact in the first quarter in the U.S. Again, we just think this is one of those quarters, based on all of the data points we have, that was sequentially softer. And how much of that was seasonality or the normal quarterly variability, difficult to know, but not seeing anything that suggests a change in fundamentals. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We've seen this before, this bed blockage (34:27) issue in the U.K. happened a couple of years ago. That's the market where we have the highest share for Stryker within Europe is in the U.K. So we definitely saw a significant impact both in our hips and knees in the U.K. But we think it's more transitory and not reflective of an underlying trend. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, guys. Two questions on Spine. First, in your prepared remarks, you called out continued market softness, but you actually hit our numbers. You hit consensus. So, has anything really changed in the Spine market? It sounds like things haven't gotten worse, but maybe not better. So, any additional color you can give there? And then my second Spine question is, can you repeat, I think your pricing pressure that you saw, did you say down double-digits? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes. I think your characterizations are correct. The market continues to be challenged. It didn't feel like it materially worsened, but it remains challenged. And the pricing declines on the core Spine down in the low double digits. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: That was sort of our core pedicle screw, not the overall portfolio. So, we do have some very innovative products within our Spine portfolio such as our 3D-printed Tritanium interbody. That's not experiencing that kind of price decreases, we're just talking about on the core products. So, last year, we experienced high single digit declines. That accelerated a little bit in the first quarter. But it's a very similar Spine market, similar challenging market that we've seen, frankly, over the last five, six quarters. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to go through, again, the increase in guidance. I'm just wondering if there's any particular division or products category that you're more excited about in terms of sustainability or growth after this quarter. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Hi, Kristen. I really think one of the things that came across kind of sort of strongly this quarter was just the balance across geographies and across our businesses, and so I think remain pretty confident in terms of that balance will carry forward throughout the year. I mean, there's a few exceptions. We talked about Sage, which should come back to growth in Q3, and obviously we just highlighted the softening we have in Spine. But other than that, we saw really, really good sort of balance across all the businesses. Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. On a good quarter, congratulations. Maybe I could just start on a follow-up on the comment you just made on Spine. It sounded that it's down double-digits in pricing. That's the first I've ever heard anyone mention something that big in a price decline for Spine. So how does that compare to what you've seen recently and how do you see that trending? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Again, we're talking about our core Spine product. So, things like our Tritanium Cage are not seeing that kind of pricing pressure, and that is not a number that's applicable to our total Spine portfolio. So our core Spine business has seen high single-digit pricing pressure. Now, it's more like 10% pricing pressure. So it is... Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: It's not a fundamental shift but... Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: ...worsened marginally but it's \u2013 and that is not a new trend. It worsened slightly. But again, that's not for the entire Spine portfolio. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just something I want to clear up, because we've had some confusion from investors tonight is, the way I think about it, if you back out the ASC 606 and all of the non-organic stuff and you add back about a point for the one less selling day, organic growth in the quarter was around 8%, correct? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: (38:48) press release, there is a reconciliation of the impact from the accounting change. And then you would add back that one point to get to that 8% number from the far-right table where you see the 7%. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. You add 1% for the selling day. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Sir, you line is now open. Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. This is Kevin Farshchi on for Matt today. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to follow up on an earlier question about neuro. Definitely was strong again. Just wanted to follow up on when we might see a bigger influence of that business, specifically neurovascular on the margin profile? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yes. So just to clarify, you're asking, is it \u2013 when will it become a bigger percentage of our margin performance? Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yes, when will we \u2013 when might it be a bigger influence on sort of that improving margin story over the course of this year? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Well, I mean, if you look at the overall size of our businesses, our MedSurg business is our largest business. And so, even if neurovascular is growing at 20% and you have endoscopy and medical as Sage comes back on growing in the double-digit levels, it has some positive impact, but it's not dramatic. When you get down to our operating margin, we don't have a huge amount of variability on our different businesses. But the variability occurs more between gross margin and op margin. So, our implant businesses including neurovascular have much higher SG&A expenses because you have sales reps standing in the operating room for every single procedure. So, yes, it does make a little bit more money at the op margin line, but it's not material. And given the smaller size relative to the $12.4 billion that we sold last year, it has some impact, but it's not dramatic in the big scheme of our overall results. Kevin M. Farshchi - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. Thanks. And then my last one is just on trauma and extremities, just continued strength there. I was curious on two parts. One, where did you see growth concentrated? And then thinking about the rest of the year off of a strong growth profile last year, what's kind of a more sustainable growth rate for the business this year? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Great question. We've actually been asking ourselves that question for the past five years. If you look at our trauma performance, we've had double-digit growth literally for five years, almost every single quarter, and they continue to perform extremely well. We have a great product portfolio. We have extremities that are doing very well for us both foot and ankle as well as upper extremities, which we're still a fairly small player, our shoulder and our reverse shoulder and our \u2013 we have a fracture system we launched last year. They are all performing very well. So, we expect to continue to outpace the market in trauma/extremities. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Craig Bijou from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Craig William Bijou - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the trauma and extremities business. Kevin, you highlighted foot and ankle and how well it's done recently. You guys haven't talked specifically in a little bit, I think, about the total ankle and your STAR Ankle. So I just \u2013 with several other competitors coming into the market with new ankles, so just wanted to get a sense for where you see that market, how you're positioned within that market. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I think we're well-positioned. We have an ankle that has terrific clinical data. We are developing the patient-specific guides to be able to make a procedure easy to do. It is a complex procedure. I think the market will continue to grow. But it's still in its early stages if you compare it to other total joint replacement procedures, but there's plenty of room for market expansion, and so I think it's going to be a good market for all players, including Stryker. Craig William Bijou - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, just the emerging market growth that you talked about, Kevin, in your script, it was strong. I just wanted to see if there was any color on specific regions that outperformed during the quarter. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Well, as you know, we're still fairly small in emerging markets overall. It was very broadly-based. So we had strength in Latin America. We had strength in Turkey, in Russia, in China. India was the one market that was a little bit soft, still. So we're still having challenges related to the price cuts on knees, but it was pretty broad strength across the regions. And I'm really pleased with the progress we've made and really firming up our leadership teams in these regions. And I do expect emerging markets to continue to perform well, and with the one exception being India, which I think will remain challenged through the course of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. Katherine or Kevin, on Mako, we continue to see a shift of procedures to the outpatient setting. Your Mako placements accelerated, as someone pointed out earlier in the call. I guess could you help me understand what impact the trend towards outpatient surgery, if any, what impact this will have on Mako utilization, and how Mako fits in and the willingness to use the robot in that patient, in that care setting? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So keep in mind, as you know, the shift is only to hospital outpatient setting, and we have sold robots into the hospital outpatient setting. How quickly procedures shift there, I think it's going to be gradual. But clearly, the Mako value proposition and certainly, as we believe the clinical data starts to come and supports the outcome, that value proposition plays out in that setting as well. I just think it's premature right now for us to guess how quickly, what percent of procedures switch to that setting, because there are \u2013 not every patient, by far, is a candidate for that setting. But we have \u2013 the vast majority of our Makos are in the hospital, but we've also sold them into the hospital outpatient setting. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. And even in the ambulatory surgery centers where right now commercial pay procedures are being done. There is an interest for Mako. The only challenge there is the capital equipment. They don't necessarily always have the same amount of capital equipment budget as a hospital, but we have very, very flexible financial solutions that we offer for that setting. So we believe we're going to be well positioned to win, not just in the hospital, but also in hospital outpatient as well as surgery centers as volume does migrate over time. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks. And just on the comments on flu and the UK kind of bed halt situation, I guess now that the flu season is more or less passed, can you give any comments on what you're seeing in terms of a pickup or resumption of surgeries getting done in those affected regions? Thanks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Let's just go back to what happened a few years ago. When we saw this in the first quarter, we did see after that temporary bed lockage, (46:24) we did see volumes come back. I would expect this year to be no different. I'm not going to comment specifically on what we're seeing right now, it's very early in the second quarter, but we would expect a normal resumption of procedural volumes just as we've seen in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Cannacord. Your line is now open. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And just two questions. First, on Mako, you've historically talked about the halo effect that you see in the market. And then just maybe a bit more color. I mean, year two of the big commercial push, you've obviously had some great success as far as competitive conversions, but just maybe give us a little more detail on the utilization trends in, I guess, your legacy Stryker accounts that are adopting Mako versus some of the new accounts that are more competitive conversions and then just how that kind of translates to some of your broader business units. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail regarding the utilization rates. I'd refer you back to the comments we made on the call, which are really the data set we're going to be providing that I think is a good picture of how we're installing, where we are with upgrades and what we are seeing with utilization rates and training surgeons and all of those data points are trending favorably. There is no doubt that that halo effect continues because once we get into a competitive account, which is now up to north of 50% and the robot is installed, the sales reps are going to sell the entire portfolio, our 3D-printed cementless product offering, revisions, et cetera. And so that is the reason why we see significantly faster growth for our total knee portfolio in accounts where we place the Mako. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. And it's specifically been tracking as roughly four to five times more growth in accounts where we have a Mako robot installed, and that's regardless of whether it's in the United States or in Europe. So it is driving growth across the entire implant portfolio. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Kevin, earlier, you referenced M&A as a core strength of the company. I mean I think that's clear. But then I just wanted to see \u2013 any update as to what you're seeing in the market just from a valuation perspective as a strategic buyer and then also, kind of an update on what the appetite is for maybe tuck-in acquisitions versus something potentially larger or more strategic? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Really there's no change in terms of what we're seeing in the market and our capital allocation strategy, which continues to prioritize M&A from the vast majority of the deals, and we've done a lot of them over the past 10 years or so, tend to be small to midsize. They tend to be the NOVADAQ type of deals that we can tuck into an existing sales and marketing infrastructure. And they really do help drive stronger organic sales growth that we've seen that consistently year in and year out. We do have the ability, given our scale and cash flow, to make bigger bets. And we've done that when you think back to Mako or Sage and Physio and I think you should assume going forward that M&A is going to continue to be a priority in terms of our use of cash because we're committed to driving faster organic sales growth at the high end of med tech. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citi. Your line is now open. Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. Let me actually start with 2018 earnings guidance. So if I kind of look at what you just did in the first quarter and take the second quarter guide of maybe 12% to 14% or so, obviously, that leads to kind of a high single-digit earnings growth for the second half of the year. So just wondering if you \u2013 if there's anything you would call out about timing for EPS growth for the year? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. No, I think it will be fairly balanced throughout the rest of the year, so there's no big timing items. I mean we do see, obviously, a giant sort of uptick in fourth quarter, which we experience every year. So that would be the only thing that probably sticks out in terms of how the quarters flow. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. The other thing would be tax, stock option comp. As we saw last year, we had much bigger benefit in the first quarter, pretty decent benefit in the second; then it really does start to peter out in the third and fourth quarter. So you should see tax will look quite different with the biggest benefit by far being in the first quarter. Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. But high single-digit growth in the second half of the year for EPS sounds about right to you? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: I think so, yeah. Amit Hazan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then on Mako, just \u2013 in terms of the sales model for the robot, we had a couple of hospitals, not many, so I don't know if this is right, but they tell us that they're leasing a unit from you as opposed actually buying it outright. And I'm wondering if that's something that you're doing more of and if so, if you can kind of give us a sense of units sold versus leased? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We've long spoken about our Flex Financial group and that we offer different options for the robot. It's one of the benefits we have of having been in the capital space because Flex Financial existed long before we did Mako to give customers different options, including sales and leases. The vast majority of the robots are outright sales, but we do have some that are leased. I wouldn't point to any discernible change in that trend though. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now open. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on Rich's question earlier, just about doing the (51:58) procedures trending to the outpatient setting. I want to just get your view on a couple of things. First, is that a risk to the knee and hip markets that potential (52:12) migration into the outpatient setting? And secondarily, if it is a risk, is AdvaMed highly involved along with the American Hospital Association in terms of (52:24) Medicare on the surgical risk for these patients? And then lastly, could it be a (52:29) on the volume side? I guess, overall, how are you thinking about the potential transition impacting the market? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So it's still early days. Obviously, Medicare has made a change, and so that you can get reimbursed in the hospital outpatient. They're not currently covering surgery centers. And it's only the commercial payers that are moving some very selected procedures. I think you've also read, I am sure, in the USA Today about other procedures that were moving to surgery centers, and I think there has been a significant backlash based on some bad outcomes. So it's really difficult to predict. I think it is a trend for the future. I think more and more procedures will move. But predicting the pace of that change is going to be tricky, especially if you have bad outcomes, that will certainly stall it. The Hospital Association for now is being very conservative about that. Within AdvaMed, we're not taking a strong stand in either direction. If the procedures migrate and they are done safely, that's fine with us. We really just want great patient outcomes. And if they end up moving to the surgery centers, we really don't see that changing the dynamic of the demand for the procedures, and we don't think that competitively it causes a problem. There has been migration already, and has not affected our business in a negative way. Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. And if I just could ask a follow-up on the (53:53) procedure specifically. There have been some reimbursement decisions negative or denials for preoperative CAT scans for knee cases. Has that been impactful, and is there a way to reverse that trend, or are you seeing any impact? Clearly, you're not seeing any impact with total knee results, but could it be if we're going forward and how can you reverse that? Thanks a lot. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, I would view that as very much the exception versus the rule. It has not been an impediment to us executing on Mako. So it just hasn't been a big factor. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I think our biggest opportunity long term here is demonstrating great outcomes, right? So we are collecting a lot of data. We are going to be doing a lot of publications. And if you demonstrate you can deliver a better balanced knee with less pain postoperatively and a series of other metrics, then the cost of the CAT scan is pretty de minimis in the overall value equation. So that's \u2013 our answer is going to be demonstrating the value of the technology. And that's going to be the answer to increase and continue to grow our business as well as to address any other concerns, such as the price of the CAT scan. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good evening. Just wanted to ask a Mako follow-up question just on the sustainability of the new system acceleration we saw in the quarter. I guess Katherine, any chance calendar played a role in that? Were there hospitals that were putting budgets together for 2018 and that just came through at the turn of the calendar? And if that was the case, I could convince myself that's a one quarter pop or I can convince myself that we're just kind of in a new era as these hospitals have had time to line the budgets up that maybe there is some sustainably of that too. So just wondering any comment there would be helpful. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I wouldn't say we saw any type of impact from budgets. I mean this is just executing on our strategy, hiring the reps, going out there and demonstrating the value proposition. And as more and more robots get out there and more and more surgeons get exposed to it, the momentum starts to build. So we're in roughly 10% of hospitals now. And so we're just seeing continued strong momentum. Until we finish all the upgrades, you will see, as you saw in Q4, quarter-to-quarter variability between upgrades versus installs. But as we said on the call, we have a lot of momentum and a lot of runway ahead of us for Mako. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. That's great. Then Glenn, just I want to make sure I understand on the ASC 606 issues. You're not restating the four quarters of 2017. Is that correct? You're saying that $28 million you would have pulled out of OpEx into revenue for each of the four quarters of 2017, if you're restating, but you're not, and that's how we kind of get to the revenue and the margin adjustments that you're kind of making for us? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, that's correct. We did not restate 2017. We adopted and modified adoption, so just 2018 has been reflected of that change, which is why I'm \u2013 given you the numbers for 2017 so you can update your models. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2018 results will be held on July 24. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Vocera Communications conference call. My name is Gabriel and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Sue Dooley from Vocera investor relations. Please proceed. Sue Dooley : Hello, everyone. Welcome to Vocera's conference call to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. This is Sue Dooley and joining me today are Vocera's CEO, Brent Lang, and Justin Spencer, our CFO. We distributed a press release detailing our quarterly results earlier this afternoon. The release is posted to our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the IR page of our website where a replay will be archived. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. These forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties described in Vocera's filings with the SEC and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On the call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll start by summarizing the highlights from the quarter. Then, I'll provide some details on key customer wins and product development achievements in Q2. I'll conclude my prepared remarks with some commentary on the market environment and hospital spending priorities, before turning the call over to Justin for some more detail on the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $43 million, up 8% over the recast financial results from the same period last year. The completeness our unique solution remains a strong differentiator for us and several large wins this quarter validated our leadership position.  Our software platform, including the integrated Engage software, continues to succeed against competitors at both new and existing customers. Our Badge also remains a key differentiator, vital to care team members at the patient bedside. Our market opportunity remains robust and we're pleased with our large deal pipeline. We had an impressive lineup of large customer wins, including four deals each over $2 million with particularly strong momentum in the federal space. We had two big wins in the Veterans' administration. VA Puget Sound was a $3 million booking and VA Houston was a $2 million booking. We also had a very important $2 million win at the new Walter Reed Military Medical Center. VA Puget Sound healthcare system is expanding from a small departmental application of our solution to a house-wide deployment including both our messaging and Engage integration software. VA Houston was suffering from too many communication silos, including landlines, pagers, and loud customers. The customer cited missed pages and excessive noise, commenting that it was taking up to three hours to locate a bed due to communication breakdowns. Our unified software platform and wearable badge are expected to eliminate silos and dysfunctional communication, thereby delivering timely patient updates and crucial lab results and also helping to prevent falls. Walter Reed, a joint army-navy facility, is the largest military medical center in the United States. This substantial win will showcase our solution as we pursue further penetration within the federal space. On the commercial side, we booked an impressive $2 million cross-sell at Allina Health in Minnesota. Allina has a long-standing Badge installation at their heart hospital. This large expansion with our Engage software is designed to ensure connectivity from their patient monitors and nurse call system to our Badges as well as Spectralink phones and smartphones. The completeness of our solution and our forward vision were paramount to this win. As you can see, we are succeeding with our cross-selling and expansion efforts. Suppliers are delivering growth and we continue to produce a very high renewal rate in software maintenance and support services. One notable expansion was at the Department of Mental Health for the State of Minnesota. At the existing Anoka-Metro Treatment Center, our handsfree communication solution has proven vital for staff safety. A year after the initial sale into Anoka, we're literally replacing plastic whistle across nine additional hospitals in what we hope will be transformational for the safety of the state mental health department. We also won key strategic expansions at Northwestern University, UNC and at the Mayo Clinic where will be sending badge alerts to anesthesiologists to streamline the process around radiation treatment and reduce sedation time for patients. Now, I'd like to talk about our international business, which was up substantially over last year, reflecting our increased focus there.  In Canada, we had a $1 million win at the Interior Health Authority in Western Canada. The CEO of IHA personally witnessed Vocera helped save the lives in the emergency department at one of their sites and has since become a strong Vocera champion. The IHA has plans to continue to roll out our solution across 10 additional community hospitals. Once this phase is complete, they will have over 5,000 active licenses. In the UK, we won a large Badge refresh from Northwest Anglia, one of our longest-standing customers in the NHS. We're also excited about an expansion win at Queensland Health in Australia, which involves the use of our Badge to optimize overall communication and even includes patients and their family members. We continue to invest in international and are gratified by our success and pipeline growth this year. International remains a big opportunity and a top priority for us in 2018.  Our professional service expertise remains a meaningful differentiator in helping our customers address their communications and workflow challenges. The expertise and scalability of our personal service organization continues to grow and deployments of our solution continue on schedule. In a highly strategic go-live, Vocera is proud to be one of the technologies being used by NYU Langone Health Systems in both its flagship Tisch Hospital as well as the brand-new, state-of-the-art Kimmel Pavilion. Vocera is the middleware solution integrating eight third-party vendors and creating 120 workflows that send alarms and alerts to nearly 1,400 newly deployed iPhones. Also during Q2, our teams deployed Vocera at the Ohio Department of Mental Health. Our solution is now in use across all six sites, standardizing workflows, improving patient care and addressing at increasing staff safety. The Panic feature is of particular importance to this customer as they strive to keep staff safe while caring for their patient population. In the UK, we had a deployment showcased on the BBC's The One Show. This was a behind-the-scenes look at the relocation of the children's board to a brand-new wing at the 141-year-old Sheffield Children's Hospital. We replaced pagers with our Badge and communications solution, saving nurses' time and creating a quieter healing environment for patients. In terms of new product development, we continue to have a busy year. In May, we brought to market our newest analytics and reporting offering. Vocera Analytics is a monitoring and diagnostic tool that provides visibility to all the traffic that goes through the Vocera platform. As a new core feature of the platform, Vocera Analytics offers a broad selection of intuitive dashboards and reports that enable clinical and IT users to quickly find the information they need to improve operational and clinical efficiencies. This offering is available to Vocera customers today and bolsters the functionality of their existing installations. By leveraging the data captured by our platform, hospital leaders can measure call patterns and interruption fatigue to gain valuable insights and drive further efficiencies, while eliminating sources of stress and fatigue for caregivers. Following the announcement in late Q1, our new collaboration suite now provides actionable, patient-specific clinical and operational data, including demographics, lab data and care team rosters. By making this information part of the communications flow and informing clinical decisions from within our app, we've made the patient the central focus for all communications. Sutter Health is one of our customers leading the way in their adoption of collaboration suite. We're having productive conversations with new and existing customers about the benefits of this offering. Finally, as part of my product commentary, I want to give you an update on an exciting development that move us further towards our longer-term goal of enabling the smart health system. Predictive analytics is one of the technologies that I have mentioned in the past that we view as a critical part of our smart hospital vision. Earlier this month, we began a referral partnership with Qventus, a leading healthcare artificial intelligence and predictive analytics company that is using analytics to help care teams optimize workflow and prevent bottlenecks before they occur.  Vocera plays an important role in making these analytics actionable by delivering the recommendations to the right care team members at the right time. Now, I'd like to talk for a moment about the market and share what we're hearing in our conversations with customers about their budget priorities. In my interactions with hospital executives, budgets are always tight, but improving margins and quality of care consistently rise to the top of their spending priority list.  Hospitals need to reduce cost and waste by eliminating friction and bottlenecks and streamlining operations. These goals are increasingly aligned with our mission to deliver the quadruple aim.  The impact our solutions can have on these executive level priorities is resulting in larger and more centralized deals as evidenced by our large deal success this quarter. In my observation of our large deal pipeline and the associated sales cycles, no two deals are like. And each of these large new customer wins and expansions has its own unique journey. As hospitals define and pursue their strategic initiatives, the timing of a specific deal can be harder to predict and the lumpiness associated with these large deals continues to be a fact of life. In some instances, this larger deal profile, combined with a cautious approach to spending, can elongate sales cycles. However, it is clear from our success that the market is very interested in what we have to offer and many customers are seeing the value in our solutions. As a result, we have a sizeable large deal pipeline and we remain laser focused on closing these deals. To help our sales force close these deals, we commissioned some research to mine and organize our case studies and third-party research into an ROI-based sales enablement tool. There are three takeaways from this work. First, we identified 11 categories of quantifiable use cases that demonstrate the value of our solution. These include ED and OR throughput, patient satisfaction, inpatient efficiency and throughput, physician and nurse turnover, staff safety, inpatient falls, and time to treatment. Second, we concluded that the link between communications and efficiency is very strong. And third, we found economic impact of improving communications can be significant. The research also concluded that the impact of patient experience has real financial consequences. We found hospitals with better patient ratings earned disproportionately more revenue per patient day than those with low ratings. And hospitals with highly-engaged staff can boost patient experience and profitability. We are excited to put these findings drawn from our customer case studies to work right away in a new ROI sales tool. We believe the economic and operational pressures on hospitals and care teams are only mounting. Hospitals are increasingly looking for ways to avoid burnout and retain vital care team members. Our vision to deliver workflow solutions to eliminate friction points along the patient journey is resonating in the market because of its helping them solve some of their most pressing challenges. The marketplace is demanding a unified solution that combines real-time voice, secure texting and deep clinical integration wrapped into a single platform. Our complete platform, combined with our large customer footprint and unparalleled experiences implementing communications solutions is unmatched in the industry. It's an exciting time for Vocera as we grow the business and progress towards our profitability goals. I'm excited by our large market opportunities and our strong competitive position. Our progress continued this quarter with several strategic new customer bookings, successful large-scale deployments, exciting new product offerings and high customer loyalty. Now, I'd like to give our CFO, Justin, a chance to cover the financial details around our Q2 results and our guidance. Justin? Justin Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone. Vocera's second quarter results represented another period of year-over-year growth in revenue and improved profitability. Total revenue in Q2 was $42.7 million, up 8% compared to last year. Keep in mind, and as previously disclosed, the revenue impact from recasting our 2017 financials under 606 was largest in Q2 and Q3, raising the comparable numbers from a year ago and lowering the year-over-year growth rates for Q2 and the upcoming third quarter. Even with this, our product revenue increased to $21.8 million. Device revenue was $15 million, similar to last year, but sequentially up from Q1, as we had expected. I mentioned during our Q1 call that our device revenue in the first half of the of last year benefited from a large portion of hardware associated with the US Army MEDCOM deal that we booked in 2016. We continued to have healthy device bookings in Q2 with our highest yet volume of Badges booked in any quarter.  Software revenue was $6.8 million, up 13% from last year. Our enhanced software platform is a key driver of our growth, highlighted by continued cross-selling and accelerated adoption of our mobile smartphone solutions across a broader base of users. A significant number of our new customer bookings now include Engage and/or our smartphone software. We see this as an ongoing trend and believe our broadened software platform, coupled with our focus on larger enterprise deals, will continue to expand our deal sizes. Services revenue in the quarter was $20.9 million, up 12% from last year. Our professional services revenue was $5.4 million, down slightly from last year. As we have seen in past quarters, our professional services growth rate can fluctuate with the timing of deployment. Additionally, as disclosed previously, the largest revenue adjustment in Q2 2017 due to ASC 606 was in professional services. The other large portion of our services portfolio is software maintenance and support. Due to our growing customer base using our expanded software platform and a renewal rate well above 95%, our software maintenance and support revenue grew 22% to $15.5 million. As a reminder, this revenue is recurring and was approximately 36% of our total revenue. Our software business in aggregate including in both the revenue from software and software maintenance now exceed 50% of our total revenue. Our combined backlog and deferred revenue balance at the end of the second quarter was $108.8 million, flat compared to Q1, reflecting a similar pattern to last year. One of the positive trends we're seeing our business is that we are converting our bookings to revenue more quickly as we have become more proficient at deploying the large enterprise deals. We're also seeing faster revenue conversion of our software bookings as these now generally be recognized upon shipment under the new accounting standard. Thus, the amount of backlog we need entering a quarter to achieve our expected revenue is lower than historic levels. I'd like to now turn to profitability, another bright spot for the quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP profitability improved substantially compared to last year. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA was $3.5 million, ahead of our expectations. We also achieved positive non-GAAP net income in the second quarter, even after including the impact of the interest expense from our recently issued convertible notes.  Here is some more detail on our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 64%, better than we expected and driven by a favorable revenue mix, particularly in software and software maintenance and support. Product margin increased year-over-year to 73% on the strength of our software revenue.  Our services gross margin increased to nearly 55%, reflecting the higher operating leverage and resource utilization we achieved in this part of our business. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $24.1 million in Q2, flat compared to last year. Our operating expenses dropped to 56% of revenue as we scale and continue to remain focused on becoming more efficient throughout our entire business. And we believe that our demonstrated operating leverage is an attractive part of our financial profile.  I'd like to wrap up my Q2 remarks with a brief comment on our balance sheet. In May, we raised capital from the issuance of roughly $144 million of convertible note that mature in 2023. The net proceeds after the purchase of a capped call and debt issuance cost were approximately $130 million. Our GAAP presentation of this debt appears as approximately $107 million as it is presented net of the equity component of this security in our financial statements. With that, let me turn to guidance. As we now look forward to the second half of the year, we believe our pipeline will enable us to achieve seasonally higher bookings than the first half, consistent with prior years. With these expected bookings and our current backlog and deferred revenue position, we reiterate our previously issued annual revenue guidance of $175 million to $183 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $14 million to $20 million. We have updated our net income and earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the new interest expense from the notes.  For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $43 million and $47 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.5 million and $6 million. As I mentioned earlier, the largest adjustment to last year's financials from the adoption of ASC 606 was in Q3. Revenue in that quarter was adjusted up by over $3 million due to the timing of some largest software shipments and net income increased by over $4 million. In summary, we were pleased with our Q2 financial results and continue to stay focused on strong execution as we transition now to the second half of the year. I'll now turn it back to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks, Justin. I'm pleased with our progress in Q2 and I believe our success underscores the strategic importance customers are seeing in our products. I'm also excited to announce that Dr. Ron Paulus has joined our Board of Directors. Ron has both an MD and an MBA and serves as the chief executive officer and president of Mission Health, one of our nation's top 15 health systems. His experience in understanding the priorities and inner workings of large health systems, as well as previously being the CEO of a software analytics company listed on the NASDAQ will provide great insight to our company as we grow our business. His leadership in advancing cultural transformation in healthcare has led to improved patient outcomes and care team resiliency in an age of clinician burnout.  His work fits well with our drive to deliver the quadruple aim. We welcome Ron and look forward to his service on our board. In summary, with highly differentiated solutions, a large market opportunity and a large pipeline of enterprise deals in front of us, we are excited to build upon our momentum.  We are driven to help make a difference to the bottom line as well as to the quality of care and staff experience of our customers. Thank you for listening today. operator, we are ready to open up the call for your questions. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Daniels : Yeah, guys. Congrats on the strong performance. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the ROI-based tool set. It sounds like that's a important development for the sales team. So, number one, is that in the market at present or was it launched in the last quarter? And if so, can you give us a little bit of feedback of what clients are saying or what your sales force is hearing they move to more of this ROI-based pitch? Brent Lang : Hey, Ryan. Thanks. Appreciate it. We really believe that ROI-based selling is going to be a critical component for deals moving forward both because of the economic environment as well as because of the fact that this decision-making is now moving to more a centralized role within the corporate headquarters. The model was developed using research that we had done with case studies with previous customers as well as some third-party data that was available. We've done initial training with our clinical executive teams. And you may remember, these are a group of individuals who formerly worked as nurses and other clinical leaders inside of hospitals and they assist the sales team in working with our customers and closing deals. So, we started by training them literally just a couple of weeks ago. And they are now rolling that out into the customers. So, it's too early to have had any impact on bookings or revenue, but because the tool was developed in conjunction with some of our existing customers, we've been able to get some feedback on the viability and the believability of the tool and we've gotten some really favorable comments and feedback on that. So, we expect it to have a very meaningful impact on our ability to sell to these larger enterprises. Ryan Daniels : Okay. And that was kind of my follow-up. Is it really something that you have developed, given pushback or hesitation to move forward from the larger enterprises, systemwide sales, if you will, or is more of an economic environment or is it more the fact that you're now moving towards systemwide deployments versus individual department? And maybe it's a component of all three. And if that's the case, maybe which of those does this address most fully? Thank you. Brent Lang : Yeah. I think it is a combination of all three. We're certainly seeing a centralization of decision-making. More RFPs are being issued. Fewer departmental level decisions are being made and more health systems are looking to standardize on a clinical communication and collaboration solution platform at a centralized basis, so then standardized across their environment. And in conjunction with that, I think that the C suite in these health systems is very focused on cost just because of the overall economic environment and reimbursement levels and cost pressures that they're facing.  So, they're prioritizing their expenditures on solutions where they can see more of a hard ROI. And a lot of what we're able to do with the tools was take some of the learnings and findings that we've had in some of our existing customer deployments and try to actually put a numeric dollar amount on that. So, at some point, I can show you the tool that the tool is really a giant spreadsheet with a number of different inputs that can be customized for a particular hospital customer and actually uses both the data from that specific hospital as well as what we've found in previous customers to be able to predict the amount of ROI cost savings or revenue enhancements that we can generate through the deployment of our solutions. And so, I think it's a combination of the economic environment, plus the decision-making process that our customers are going through. Ryan Daniels : Okay, great. Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the federal business. You talked about the momentum there and some of the wins. This is sort of a two-parter, but part number one is can you give us some insight in terms of what's driving that? Is that related to the budget increases under the new administration?  And then, part two, given that the federal side, I guess, the last couple of years, there's tended to be a lot more activity in the third quarter. As that momentum builds, would it be reasonable to assume that you'd see even more activity in terms of bookings from the federal side next quarter? Brent Lang : Yeah. Both good questions, Matt. So, I think with regard to your first question, what's really driving this is a combination of the fact that both the VA and DOD are seeing really strong results from the deployments that they've already made with our solutions. And that positive word is spreading across the rest of these system. We have met a number \u2013 as you and I talked about, a number of certification requirements, security requirements, product qualification requirements, Vocera effectively is the vendor of choice for both of those parts of the federal government.  Clearly, a more stabilized budget environment is helping them make purchase decisions, but I think that more of it has to do with just the track record that we've established there. With regard to your second question, you're absolutely right. typically, we see the bulk of our federal bookings in Q3. And so, we take it as a very positive sign that we were able to land these substantial bookings in Q2. I think it's really a result of not just being kind of a last-minute purchase, but really something that they're looking more strategically at and planning for further in advance. We still anticipate having a very strong Q3 of federal bookings as well. We've got a number of deals in the pipeline that are teed up for the Q3 timeframe as well. Just really a very positive trend line for us in the federal government. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up question, I did want to ask about the guide, especially in the full year. And I just want to make sure I understood the dynamics. So, the revenue in the last two quarters has come in at the high end. I think your EBITDA has been above the high end of the quarterly ranges as well. You also mentioned that the pipeline is really strong. So, I guess, those would all be indicators that you're tracking, I guess, closer to the high-end of guidance versus the low end. But you also mentioned that, with the pipeline having bigger deals, there's also some lumpiness. And is that the factor that's, I guess, causing you not to at least raise the low-end or are there other factors that we should be thinking about in terms of your maintaining the current ranges? Justin Spencer : Hi, Matt. I think you're thinking about those in the right way. The primary thing that we focus on here at the midpoint of the year is we're right on track with kind of where the business is at this point. But as we look now to the second half of the year, our bookings are seasonally up quite significantly and that's a typical pattern that we've seen over the last couple of years. So, we feel really good about where we are. We still have a lot of work to do in terms of generating new bookings in Q3, Q4. We feel really good about where the pipeline is, but those are seasonally higher. And so, we're trying to take a conservative view of trying to make sure that we set ourselves up to be successful and be in the best position possible to exceed expectations. All of the core revenue conversion metrics are progressing really, really well. And as we continue to deliver on our bookings targets in the second half, we feel like we'll be in a good position to hopefully come in in a strong place in the guidance range. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, a quick follow-up to Matt's question and then I have a question on the international market.  Brent, the Walter Reed booking that you got this quarter, is it the first venture into the navy hospitals. And I don't think you guys have done much in the navy. Can you remind us, like, what's the opportunity in the navy? Brent Lang : Hey, Mohan. Yeah, you're right. This was one of the most substantial wins. It's a joint army-navy facility. So, we had a little bit of help there. But I do think that we're excited about the fact that this potentially could accelerate our business in the other two branches. And anytime we can get visibility with a facility like Walter Reed, it's goodness for our business. We expect that to be a very high profile account and we have a lot of excitement associated with it. Mohan Naidu : Got it. So, on the international market, so great data points in this quarter. As you look out, do you expect the grow rate on the international side to outpace domestic growth? And a few years back, you tried to enter into non-English-speaking regions. What are you thinking about that? Any outlook that you can talk about on the international side would be great. Brent Lang : Yeah. I think it's fair to say we absolutely the expect the growth rate in international would be higher than our domestic growth rate. As you heard me say before, we'd like to see international grow to be 20% to 25% of our business from where it is today in the low teens. And, obviously, in order to do that, it's going to need to grow faster than our domestic business. And the reason we believe that's the realistic goal is because we have very low penetration in the international markets that we're in. There is a much larger greenfield opportunity in those and we're starting from a smaller base. And so, as a result, the opportunity to drive growth there is very substantial. One of the things that we're learning, and I think we started this process last year and it's continuing is that, in order to be successful in these international market, it requires the same level of commitment that we would make to the domestic market here. What I mean by that is that it's not just a matter of having a sales rep in country, we need clinical executives, we need sales engineers, we need professional services folks, we need to be able to establish commitment to the region. And that's some of the investment we started making last year. And we're starting to see the dividends from that. The other piece of it are things like marketing support, lead generation, the air cover that leads to driving increased pipeline and increased deal flow, and that's something that I think you'll see us doing more investment in over the coming years \u2013 or month and years.  Right now, we don't see a strong need to expand out beyond the English-speaking markets. And you could say on one hand, why not be greedy and go after it all? Basically, the assessment that we've made is that there is such a large opportunity within our existing international markets that we would rather sort of double down our investment in those regions rather than going through the process of opening up another international market that may not have as attractive of a growth profiles of the markets that we're already in. And so, in markets like the UK, we're seeing good success after some of the changes we made there. Canada has been performing really, really well. I think there's an enormous opportunity in Australia where most of our business today has been in long-term care. We've only got a handful of hospital customers there. So, there's a great growth opportunity there. And then, as I've mentioned before, the Middle East is really the potential explosive growth opportunity. And we continue to see some success there as well.  So, I don't think you'll see a lot of expansion outside of our existing markets in the near-term, but you will see increased investment and, hopefully, accelerating growth there. Mohan Naidu : And just a quick follow-up, Brent, on the international markets. You're still relying on the resellers for those countries, right? Brent Lang : Correct. It's kind of a hybrid model. We typically have feet on the street there locally, but we're also partnering with local partners who have the relationships and can help with the lay of the land in those geographies. Absolutely. Mohan Naidu : That's great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Brent Lang : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sean Wieland : Hi. Thanks so much. So, on the large deal pipeline, I understand the difficulty to predict the timing of these, but what do you think your outlook is on the cadence of these deals? And in terms of timing, is this pipeline shaping up to be 2018, 2019, maybe beyond? Just any more commentary you could provide there? Brent Lang : Yeah. So, Sean, as you can imagine, we've got that large deal pipeline staged by quarter and stage of sales cycle. And we cut the data a lot of different ways. So, there are certainly large deals that we're expecting to close here remaining in 2018. Some of them were forecasted to close through 2019 as well. And the cadence quarter-to-quarter is going to vary, but I think we should expect to see a couple every quarter. And that's why we're pleased with the success in Q2 to have four deals over $2 million apiece. It was a really good accomplishment for us this quarter. I'd love to repeat that kind of on going forward basis. And as we look out into the future, we've got plenty of deals in the pipeline to be able to support that. My comment around just predicting \u2013 making it hard to predict when a particular deal is going to close, simply just points to the fact that we need to have multiple planes in the area to be given time, so that we can have a handful coming in every quarter without necessarily worrying about putting all of our eggs into one particular basket. And I think that was the comment I was just trying to make there. Sean Wieland : Okay. And then, given your track record to date in the enterprise segment or the large deal segment, what's been your win rate in that segment? Brent Lang : Very high. I don't know that we've got a specific number. I don't think we've classified the deals by deal size. But, if anything, the larger the deal, the more success we have because, typically, when these enterprises are looking to make a larger purchase, they try to take a more risk-free choice by going with the market leader. The breadth of our solution, being able to be kind of one platform that combines voice and messaging and alerting and alarming altogether tends to work in our favor, and so I would say our success rate amongst the enterprise deals is higher.  We've quoted in the past a win rate in the 70% to 80% range. I would expect the enterprise win rate to be at that level or higher. Sean Wieland : Okay. And then, one final follow-up is, do you have the existing sales and implementation consultants kind of on hand and ready to handle the pipeline? Brent Lang : We do, yeah. Absolutely. We ended up with capacity, extra capacity as a result of the acquisition we made and we've sort of been growing into that. But the efficiency of the teams has also gotten much greater. And I think Justin actually references in his script our ability to install these more efficiently has been proved over time because we've done more of them. And we kind of know where the potential potholes are and so we're able to project-manage around those. And I would say, at this point, the team is really well positioned to be able to handle an inflow of additional large deals. Sean Wieland : All right. Thanks so much. Brent Lang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jamie Stockton : Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, maybe the first one, just on the convert that you guys issued, you showed a lot of discipline for a long time, letting cash sit on the balance sheet before you pulled the trigger on the extension deal. Can you just talk about \u2013 should we be expecting other transactions of that size and that's going to ultimately be the use of the proceeds? Obviously, we've gone through a period here where valuations got really frothy for a lot of private companies, but I assume they've come down recently. Just what are your thoughts around the use of the proceeds and kind of the environment right now? Justin Spencer : Hey, Jamie. I would start by saying that we didn't raise the money with a specific deal in mind. So, it wasn't like we already had a deal in the works and we were just going to look to fund it. It was really the opportunity to put some dry powder into the bank, so that we would be prepared if and when the right opportunity came along. Secondly, I would say that, at any given moment in time, we're looking at a range of different deals and there are a number of companies that are coming on to market in our broader space, I think looking for consolidation opportunities and finding how hard it is to survive as an independent company. But, as you know, we tend to be pretty selective, pretty disciplined about which opportunities we're going to engage in. I think the sweet spot for us starts with, does it match our strategic vision around enabling the smart hospital or the digital hospital. From there, obviously, it has to pass through a number of financial hurdles to make sure that it's going to match with our business model. In terms of size, I think the sweet spot for us is sort of in the $5 million to $40 million in revenue, but that's, obviously, a pretty wide range. And then, obviously, cultural fit and all the other considerations that go into it. One of the things we've found is that we want to make sure that we were in the pipeline or we were in the consideration zone for the opportunities that came on the marketplace and certainly raising the money in advance is a signaling to the market that we can be an active participant in any of these many processes that might start up. Jamie Stockton : Okay, that's great. And then, maybe just a quick one, maybe for Justin, the services gross margin is pretty good. It had a pretty healthy uptick sequentially. Should we assume that this is a level that can be easily built off of? Or is there a need \u2013 maybe touching on Sean's questions earlier for you to invest in expanding the headcount to be able to deal with maybe some of these larger deals that are in the pipeline? Justin Spencer : Hi, Jamie. The services margin is a function of really the leverage that we have in our fixed cost as we deliver two main revenue streams \u2013 the professional services revenue stream as well as the software maintenance and support.  The biggest driver in Q2 was clearly the higher growth in software maintenance and tech support and the utilization of being able to provide those services on a relatively constant fixed cost. So, there's a lot of leverage there. We do think that Q2 represents a solid baseline. We typically see, again, as the revenue continues to increase in the second half, following our normal seasonal pattern, we would expect our gross margins overall, including the service margins, to increase in conjunction with that revenue increase. Jamie Stockton : All right. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open. Matthew Hewitt : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the questions. First one, I was hoping you could go into the predictive analytics offering with Qventus. Maybe provide a little bit more color on how that model works from a revenue perspective and maybe if you have any color on how big of an opportunity you can see that being? And is it initially more of a cross-selling opportunity into the install base or will that be more greenfield type opportunities, something to go into initial customer visit and bring that up right off the bat? Brent Lang : Yeah. So, let me provide some context. So, first of all, Qventus, for those not familiar with them, is a start-up company here in Silicon Valley. There are about six years old as a company. They have about 100 customers. And they are kind of the prototypical big data play where they take hospital data, they put it through a machine learning algorithm and they're able to identify key insights and learnings from that, everything from throughput bottlenecks in the emergency department based on looking at bunch of data or staffing challenges or patients with high fall risks. The technology can really be applied to a range of different kinds of solutions. The work that we've done with them up to date has primarily been around falls, reducing falls in hospitals and delivering that information out to the care provider quicker. The business relationship that we've established with them is a referral agreement. So, we're actually leveraging our existing sales force with those existing customers and new prospects to make introductions to Qventus, who will ultimately be responsible for closing those deals. So, it's not a lot of money associated with it because the referral fee is smaller than what might have been if we were a full reseller or if it was, obviously, our own product. The strategic reason for doing it is really more around highlighting the capabilities of the platform and the vision around getting to the sizing of the smart hospital that's enabled through data. So, it's not something that we're anticipating is going to have a huge topline impact because of the sale of the Qventus piece itself, but we think that it will help drive platform deals and help us actually win more of these enterprise accounts that will ultimately lead to the sale of more Vocera software licenses and client devices and professional services. So, hopefully, that gives you some context. Matthew Hewitt : Yeah. That does help. Thank you very much. And then, maybe one last one here. The four $2 million wins this quarter, obviously, a great number. Is that kind of an average we should be thinking about when you talk about these large enterprise deals in the pipeline or is there still a lot of variability where you could have a couple under $2 million, couple that are $7 million, $8 million, how should we be thinking about your average enterprise type of deal? Thank you. Brent Lang : Yeah. Part of it is just definitional. We're arbitrarily chosen to say that anything over $1 million, we're going to classy as one of these larger deals that we're going to track essentially in a separate pipeline just essentially for our own tracking purposes. The actual size of the deal, like you say, will vary quite a bit from $1 million to $2 million to much larger than that in some cases. So, it's hard to give a specific average, but, typically, it's going to be a function of the size of a hospital and then the brunt of the solution that they're deploying. Is it an Engage only? Is it a Vocera Communications piece only? Is it the combined platform? What's the level of penetration? And in some cases, it depends on whether they're buying for one hospital facility or multiple facilities. So, we are going to see quite a bit of variability in the deal size? The Franciscan example at $9 million versus some of these at $2 million to $3 million, obviously, shows that variability. So, it's hard to put a specific number on it, but I think it's more the way that they're being tracked and the way the hospital systems are thinking about doing their budgeting and approval process. Matthew Hewitt : Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Brent Lang : Yep, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Demko from Citi. Your line is open. Stephanie Demko : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the solid quarter. Brent Lang : Thank you. Stephanie Demko : So, I've got another one on margin piece. Just given the margin beats the last few quarters, it seems like it's mostly been driven by the strong software growth. What is driving your more conservative second half margin expansion expectation? Justin Spencer : Yeah. Hi, Stephanie. So, our revenue mix is a key driver of our overall kind of gross margin structure. And sometimes that can be a bit difficult to predict. So, we tend to be a bit conservative with not just our revenue guidance, but as well as our profitability because, with the gross margin piece, the variables are not only the amount of revenue, but also the mix of our revenue, and that tends to kind of ebb and flow. Having said all that, we're really pleased with the gross margin structure so far this year. We've really been focused on improving that. It's an important part of our overall financial story. Our target model, we're tracking really well and on track to be able to march towards our 68% plus gross margin structure, and that is, in large part, driven by the evolution of our revenue business towards more of a software organization. So, the mix of the business this quarter was driven by a strong software revenue, as well as from maintenance and software maintenance and support. Those are our highest margin contributors and it can ebb and flow. The second thing, as you say, is that, typically, from a seasonal standpoint, we tend to see higher gross margins in the second half. So, we do expect that pattern to recur again and our implied guidance for the second half does reflect that normal seasonal increase. Stephanie Demko : All right. Understood. Thank you. And unrelated follow-up just on the recent VA wins, given a lot of the VA operations tend to move in tandem with each other, would there be anything preventing you guys from getting full penetration in the VA opportunity? Brent Lang : I don't think so. No. In fact, that's our goal. Most of the purchasing decisions in the VA are made amongst the regional business and the budgets are typically controlled at the division level. But at this point, we expect to eventually be deployed across all of those VA facilities. Stephanie Demko : All right. Good to hear. Well, thank you so much. Brent Lang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gene Mannheimer from Dougherty & Company. Your line is open. Gene Mannheimer : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Brent Lang : Hi, Gene. Gene Mannheimer : I joined the call a bit late. So, sorry, if this has been asked, but on the international side, clearly, some optimism around your prospects there. Sounds like this year, international will be better than last. When you think about your pipeline there, is it comprised of some fewer very large deals that are in play or is it a composition of multiple smaller deals? How should we think about international versus domestic in terms of size and scope of those contracts? Brent Lang : Hey, Gene. I think I would separate it into two buckets. If you looked at the Middle East, I would classify it as a fewer number of quite large deals, enterprise, multimillion dollar deals. If you look at the opportunity in the UK and Australia and, to some extent, in Canada, it's more typical that it's going to be singles and doubles. They're going to be smaller, but more of them that we're interacting with. And the reason for the difference there, I think, is that typically in the Middle East, in many cases, we're going into new hospital construction and they're making a decision to go house-wide upon the initial opening of the hospital. Whereas in the UK or in Australia, typically, what we're seeing is, maybe a wing or a department, it's growing more virally from there. So, a little bit of a difference depending on which of the international markets we're talking about. Gene Mannheimer : Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks. That's all I had for now. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink. Your line is open. David Larsen : Hi. Congrats on the good quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to sell Engage in the UK? Is there any sort of approval process that you need to get from the UK in order to be able to sell a solution over there? Brent Lang : Yeah. Hi, Dave. In fact, there is. And we just passed through at about three months ago. And it was a big deal actually. We had to go through some very specific approvals. I can't remember of the certification off the top of my head. But that has actually been accomplished now and the team in the UK is actually using that as part of selling into new opportunities as well going back into the install base of customers there in the UK and doing it as a cross-sell. David Larsen : Is there anything about the UK market that \u2013 can it be as attractive and as lucrative as the US market? Is there anything about the technologies that are deployed at those UK facilities that maybe would cause there to be less demand from Engage or would you expect the level of demand to be just the size of the US? Brent Lang : So, I would say two things. One of the biggest challenges of the UK market is that many of the hospitals are very, very old buildings that are made out of thick stone. And so, one of the biggest challenges is getting really strong wireless coverage throughout the facility. And it actually has become challenging even to run cabling because many of them are protected buildings and that kind of thing. So, that affects not just the Engage part of our business, but just the overall growth of wireless solutions. I think in terms of the demand for Engage, there's probably a little less integration demand in UK today than there is here in the US in terms of the number of different systems that they're trying to bring together. The workflows are actually very similar, but I would say that they are a few years behind in terms of the demand for wanting to bring all that data together into one flow. But I would say that, so far, since the certification, we've gotten a real positive feedback from the customer base. So, I think we'll see some nice growth there. It may not be at the same rate that we're seeing here in the US. David Larsen : Okay. And then, with the strategic account deals, do you have a separate group of sales guys and ladies that focus on these large strategic accounts? And, like, of your 75 reps, how many are in a strategic group? And is that a new group or not? Any color around that would be very helpful? Brent Lang : Yeah. So, we created this strategic account group, basically, at the beginning of the year and there are now four people who are in that group. They act as a bit of an overlay. So, they don't own a geographic territory. They work in conjunction with our geographic based sales force. So, when the geography-based sales reps identify opportunities that are larger in nature and likely have more complexity in order to get the deal closed and to navigate the organization, then one of the strategic accounts team members will come in and assist with that. And then, independently of that, the strategic accounts folks are also calling directly on some of the larger self-help systems at the headquarters level. We would anticipate that we're going to continue to grow the strategic accounts group. It's, obviously, very small today, but we see more and more the market moving in that direction and see an opportunity to continue to have more resources in that area. David Larsen : Okay. And then, just one more for me. Justin, with regards to the deferred revenue and backlog amount, is that in line with your expectations? And is the trend of the past two quarters consistent with the previous years? Thanks. Justin Spencer : Hi, Dave. Yeah, the backlog and deferred revenue pattern that we've seen being potentially flat is very similar and consistent with prior years. The other thing that I mentioned earlier is that because of our greater proficiency at being able to convert our bookings to revenue a bit more quickly, with regard to large deals, as well as benefiting a little bit from the ASC 606 adoption, we don't require as much backlog going into a quarter as we have in the past. So, the backlog and the deferred revenue balance, where it is currently, provides an adequate level of visibility to our second half revenue objective. David Larsen : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Wardell from Chardan Capital Markets. Your line is open. Steven Wardell : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brent Lang : Sure. Steven Wardell : Can you give us some additional color on the demand you're seeing from buyers in the marketplace? What segments of the markets are you seeing more or less demand in and what mix of products are they interested in and would you say the demand you're seeing now is greater or less than last year? Brent Lang : Yeah. I think the way I would characterize it is that there is a growing awareness of a category here. So, the category of clinical communications and collaboration is a defined category that Gartner and others have identified it as a category, they've identified it as a key component towards the evolution that they see hospitals needing to go through over the next couple of years. And that's relatively new for us. For much of the history of the company, it was much more of a missionary fail for us where we were having to go out and generate awareness and generate demand for our solutions.  What, I think, we're seeing now is more proactive interest with an increasing recognition of the impact that communication can have on the efficiency and on patient safety and patient satisfaction. And so, we're seeing an increase in the number of RFPs that are being submitted into the marketplace and we're seeing an increased focus from decision-makers who have probably invested a lot of money in their electronic health record in past years and are now looking for ways to mobilize that data and get that data into the hands of caregivers at the point of care. There's a lot of frustration that the workflows that have resulted from the implementation in the EHR has created more difficult situations for both nurses and doctors, and so we often hear requests from health systems to help them rethink their clinical workflows and rethink how they're going to leverage the data in the EHR.  The other thing that I would say is that, as we've evolved from being primarily about voice communication to now focusing on both voice and text messaging and the alerts and alarms, the growing interest in the database communication, whether that's messaging or alert and alarming in conjunction with voice communication, I think, is on the rise. And what we're seeing in the marketplace is an appreciation of a vendor that can deliver a complete solution rather than having to get various pieces of the solution from a variety of different vendors and then having to force the systems integration to be done at the customer site.  So, broadly, I would say that the level of interest in our category of solution is up and that's, obviously, a tailwind for our business. Steven Wardell : Great, thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Brent Lang : Okay. Thanks, everybody, for dialing in today. We really appreciate your time. And we look forward to following-up with you. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako and K2M. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. With organic sales growth of approximately 8%, our strong top line momentum continued in Q3, reflecting the strength of our diversified revenue model. Neurotechnology and Spine was once again the standout delivering 12% organic growth in the quarter as Neurotechnology grew 17%. MedSurg posted a 9% gain with Instruments leading the way. Orthopaedics increased approximately 5% powered by over 8% growth in Knees as Mako continues to gain traction. We are now approaching 600 robots globally and continue to feel bullish about the future of robotic-assisted surgery. On a geographic basis, sales were well-balanced in the developed markets and we grew double-digits in emerging markets. With cost transformation for growth initiatives continuing, operating margin increased roughly 50 basis points in the quarter despite significant acquisition-related dilution. With R&D at 6.7% of sales in Q3, we continue to focus on internal innovation, which is driving a steady cadence of new product launches. With the strong organic sales growth and operating margin expansion, we delivered adjusted per share earnings of $1.69 towards the high end of our targeted range of $1.65 to $1.70 for the quarter. Given our solid performance through the first three quarters of the year and our conviction in our Q4 outlook, we are raising our full year guidance for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on Mako with updates on the key metrics we have shared in recent quarters along with an update on our recently announced plans to acquire K2M. In the third quarter, we installed a total of 37 robots globally with 26 in the U.S. compared to a total of 33 in the year-ago quarter of which 23 were in the U.S. As expected, upgrades of robots in the field to the Total Knee application were largely completed in the third quarter. Over 50% of the robots installed in Q3 were in competitive accounts with Stryker either has no market share or share well below our average number. During Q3, roughly 145 surgeons were trained on the Total Knee bringing the total number of surgeons trained since launch to approximately 1,350. Looking at U.S. procedures in Q3, Mako Total Knee procedures approximated 11,300 bringing the year-to-date total to over 30,000 with all Mako procedures topping 18,700 in the quarter, Total Knees represent the majority of roughly 60%. Utilization rates also continue to increase, up about 40% year-over-year. We are also pleased with the increasing Mako Total Knee data supporting both the clinical and economic benefits. Specifically, a prospective study was recently published in The Bone & Joint Journal, which compared early postoperative functional outcomes and time to discharge between conventional jig-based Total Knee arthroplasty and Mako-assisted TKA. The study included 40 consecutive patients in each arm with all surgeries performed by a single surgeon. Overall, the study concluded that the Mako treated patients achieved statistically significant improvement with respect to decreased pain, improved early functional recovery and reduced time to hospital discharge compared with conventional knee surgery. And as it relates to hospital stay, patients treated with the Mako robot were discharged over one full day earlier than traditional knee surgery patient. Additionally, just this week, the Hip and Knee Society published a paper comparing 90-day episode of care cost with patients receiving a Mako Total Knee replacement versus conventional knee surgery. Overall, the study determined that Mako Total Knee patients episode of care cost were $2,391 less than conventional knee replacement. Additionally, index facility cost and length of stay were also less with Mako. And the Mako patients were discharged less the skilled nursing facilities and had a 90-day readmission reduction of 33%. All outcomes measured in the study were statistically significantly favorable to Mako-assisted knee replacement. Overall, we are pleased with the continued adoption of the Mako robot and it's clearly enabling us to drive meaningful knee market share. The early clinical data is encouraging and underscores the unique features and capabilities of the Mako robot that are enabling differentiated outcomes. Turning to K2M, in late August, we announced plans to acquire K2M for approximately $1.4 billion. K2M provides Stryker Spine with a highly complementary and innovative product portfolio which includes an attractive minimally invasive offering. The combined business will have a competitive portfolio across Stryker Spine product categories and leverage a powerful commercial engine. With the addition of K2M's proven product portfolio, consistent track record of execution and robust pipeline, Stryker Spine business will be well-positioned to sustain innovation and provide our customers and employees with proven product. We are excited Eric Major, Chairman and CEO of K2M, will be joining Stryker as President of our Spine division. Eric's longstanding relationships with thought leading surgeon as well as his history of driving a strong sales execution culture is expected to optimize the integration and execution of the combined group. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Thanks, Katherine. Today, I'll focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. We have provided our detailed financial results in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 7.9% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q3 2017. Additionally, it is anticipated that the selling days will have no meaningful impact on the fourth quarter or full year growth. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.6% from the prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 1% impact on sales. U.S. organic sales growth was 8.3% and international organic sales growth was 7%. Both geographies have the same number of selling days. In the U.S., there were strong performances across all segments. International sales growth was led by emerging markets : Europe, Australia and Japan. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.69 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong drop through on sales growth combined with operating expense control. Consistent with our expectations, third quarter EPS had no significant impact from exchange rates. Now, I'll provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency and organic growth of 5% including organic growth of 4.4% in the U.S. This performance was highlighted by strong performances in knees of 8.4%. With the Knee business, we continue to see a high demand for our Mako TKA knee platform and 3D-printed products. Our Trauma & Extremities business had moderate growth and was impacted by softness in the market and product supply issues. We anticipate that the product issues will not impact Q4 and we expect sales acceleration in 2019 as we launch a number of new products in Trauma. Internationally, Orthopaedics delivered organic growth of 6.2%, which reflects solid performances in Europe, emerging markets and Australia. MedSurg continue to have strong growth across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 10.4% and organic gains of 8.8%, which included a 10.1% increase in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.5%. This included exceptional performances across the product portfolio including power tools including System 8; waste management, including Neptune; Steri-Shield and ProCare Service. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 6.2%. Endoscopy had strong performances across its general surgery products and its sports medicine, communications and ProCare businesses. In September, Endoscopy's NOVADAQ acquisition anniversaried and became part of organic growth. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 12.4%, reflecting solid performances at its Sage, Patient Care and Physio businesses. As expected, Medical Sage business drove a significant amount of growth as Q3 2017 included Sage's product hold and the comps were very low. Medical did face tough comps in the core capital businesses as that segment had exceptionally strong mid-teens growth in the year-ago quarter helping to offset the impact of the Sage recall. For the third quarter, Sage had a 7% impact on Medical's organic sales growth and a 1% impact on overall Stryker's organic growth. Overall, Medical's core capital businesses have a solid pipeline, which is expected to drive strong Q4 sales. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 4% with good performance in emerging markets, Australia and Japan. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 18.3% and organic growth of 11.9%. This growth reflects double-digit performances across all of our Neurotech businesses and less of a market headwind in core Spine. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted organic growth of 16.7% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for our hemorrhagic, ischemic stroke, CMF and our Neuro powered instruments. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our Entellus acquisition integration. Our Spine business reflects double-digit growth of our IVS business and our Tritanium implant products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.4%. This performance was driven by continued high demand across most geographies for our Neurotech products. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. As noted in the press release and discussed in our Q1 earnings call, the adoption of ASC 606 primarily had the impact of reclassifying certain expenses from SG&A to sales. As such, all references to basis point improvements are net of this impact. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was up approximately 50 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin expansion was favorably impacted by comps including impacts from prior year mild weather, productivity and efficiently \u2013 efficiency partially offset by price, foreign exchange and business mix. R&D spending was 6.8% of sales which was slightly higher than prior year quarter. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.6% of sales which was in line with the prior year quarter. This reflects the continued focus on operating expense improvements through our Cost Transformation for Growth CTG program, including key projects focused on indirect purchasing and shared services as well as some favorability arising from prior year quarter comps as it relates to Sage and weather disruptions. Offsetting these benefits were the continued planned CTG investments like ERP, the write-off of certain legacy software assets and the negative impact of acquisitions which had a notably higher dilution compared to the prior year. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.9% of sales or approximately 40 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Our operating margin primarily reflects good leverage and continued operational savings offset by CTG investments, the one-time write-off and acquisitions, the latter of which had an approximately 50-basis-point negative impact in the quarter. We remain highly confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment of driving a minimum of 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin. Next, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to favorable interest income. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1% reflects an underlying operating tax rate of approximately 18%, offset partially by the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.2 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 30% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet was unchanged from year-end at $7.2 billion. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.6 billion. This reflects increased earnings and lower recall-related payments which were somewhat offset by increases in working capital including higher tax payments as a result of Tax Reform and specifically required payments related to the toll tax on previously untaxed foreign profits. And now I will discuss the fourth quarter guidance. Based on our performance to-date and anticipated strength in the remainder of the year, we now expect organic annual sales growth to be at the high end of our previously guided range of 7% to 7.5% for 2018. As a reminder, Q4 and the full year have the same number of selling days. Given our year-to-date performance and continued momentum, we now expect that our adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $7.25 to $7.30 for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.13 to $2. 18. This guidance, full year and quarter, includes anticipated impacts from the aforementioned business investments, the previously announced $0.04 of dilution related to Entellus and potential dilution from acquisitions that may close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as highlighted in our Q2 earnings call, it also includes full year foreign currency favorability of approximately $0.05. And now, I will open the call up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. One, I want to ask you on the operating margins. And if we back out the 50 bps with M&A, we're at 90 bps of operating margin expansion for the quarter for the business. Maybe you could just give us your thoughts on where you see the business now following the changes in compensation. It's clear that the businesses is growing fast on the operating margin line. So help us understand what you think Stryker is on a go-forward basis in terms of operating margin grower? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think as you look at operating margin, we're not backing off of our guidance at all in terms of minimal 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion. We still believe that that is one of the things that we can hold true to even given the sort of negative dilution that we'll get through our M&A or even potential M&A. I mean, keep in mind, we also delivered fairly good gross margin performance this quarter. That includes sort of the impact of mix, price and productivity and efficiency. I also think that we're starting to see some savings from some of our sort of shorter-term CTG programs, which include indirect spend efforts and shared services efforts. So overall, I feel very committed and strong it will make our minimum of 30 basis points to 50 basis points and we'll hold firm on that guidance. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And maybe just as a follow-up. You called out Trauma into the quarter. Maybe you could think about as where guidance is raised organically to the upper end of the range of 7.5%. Help us think about some of the pluses and minuses in fourth quarter that can help us get there versus the third quarter. Appreciate it. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Robbie, are you saying specifically for Trauma or for total company in the fourth quarter. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, no, no. You called out Trauma was a headwind in third quarter. Help us think about some of the pluses going into the fourth quarter across the businesses to be aware of. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Really it's going to be very reflective of this quarter. There's a lot of our businesses that have some really strong tailwinds right now whether it's in Neuro, whether it's in Ortho or MedSurg. And those getting later in this lifecycle with its 1588 camera and they're gearing up to launch 1688 which will happen in the first half of next year, but they had strength in other parts of the business in the quarter. So, I wouldn't say there's any one standout, but there is a lot of our businesses that have very strong momentum heading into Q4 which is historically, as we know, our strongest quarter. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Now, the only thing I'd like to add, Robbie, is if you look as to how we've done all year, our year-to-date sales growth organically is roughly in that 7.5%, 7.6%, 7.7% range. So we're basically expecting more of the same in the fourth quarter. We had a very good fourth quarter last year, but we're really firing on a lot of cylinders right now and feeling pretty healthy about our businesses. From quarter-to-quarter, of course, you will see a little bit more bounce. Maybe in Neurotech, we saw a really big bounce this quarter. Will it stay up in the 17% range that might moderate just a hair, but overall, we're in a very stable position right now across our business and feeling very good about our growth outlook. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Can you hear me, okay? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Hi, Bob. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, great. Good afternoon. So two quick questions. The first one just, Kevin, from a big picture perspective. I know we're not finished with 2018 yet, but it is shaping up to be, as you said, an exceptional year from a revenue growth perspective given your new guidance at 7.5% at the high-end. So just how confident are you that you can continue that growth? What are the things in the pipeline that we should be focused on for next year versus things that might slow? So just trying to check your confidence for next year relative to the super-strong year this year? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Bob. And as we noticed, it's been I guess five years now we've increased our organic growth year-after-year. It's been rising. Obviously, MedTech markets are also been pretty good, but we've been continuing to outpace the market pretty significantly. As I sit here today, I feel like going into 2019 it's going to be more of the same. And we have a healthy balance of headwinds and tailwinds, it's very similar to what we had going into this year. We have a good cadence of new products launched. Katherine mentioned a big launch coming within our MedSurg business. We also have a lot of Trauma products that we'll be launching. I look at Mako and we're just continuing to ramp at Mako. I think that will continue and especially internationally where we're only just starting to receive approvals for \u2013 we have the hip approved, but we don't yet have the knees approved in big markets like Japan and China. That will happen next year. So if you look at Physio-Control, we have a number of new launches coming. So I'm feeling very good about the cadence of new products. And of course, we'll have some other products that are later in the cycle System 8, probably won't be as strong next year as it is this year. But overall feel very good balance and feel like we're in a very good position to continue the strong organic sales growth momentum that we've had for the last few years. Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then one other \u2013 thank you for that. One last follow-up on Mako. Obviously, thanks for giving us the numbers, obviously it sounds like things are going really well there. And you've mentioned every quarter how you're placing Mako in competitive accounts. And now one of those competitors Zimmer Biomet is going to be launching their own version of a robot over the next couple of months at least in theory. So can you talk to us a little bit about the stickiness of the competitive business that you've won as we look out over the course of the next 12 months and 24 months? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Bob. I think it's safe to say given the investment and not just the cost of the capital and $1 million robot, but the investment of a surgeon to be a champion to get trained on the robot to have his OR staff trained on what is a shift in how you do the procedure and then get familiar into a competitive account with new products. It's very sticky. And so that's why we believe that competitive advantage we have not just in what our robot is capable of doing and that's where the definition of a robot is really critical. But also having a multi-year lead head-start in getting robots out there, we've got close to 600 globally and continuing to sell new robots with a healthy pipeline. And now you're starting to see the clinical data, the early clinical data come in with our clinical and economic benefit that is specific to our robot. And so obviously, competition is coming. You don't grow ahead of the market at the rate we are without people thinking that maybe they need a robot, but this is a very sticky business once we get a robot in there. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, Bob, the one thing I'd like to add is what I found very encouraging with the early studies is that it's pointing to a specific benefit related to our haptic \u2013 the haptic feature of our robot and that you don't use jigs. And by not using jigs, you really protect the soft tissue envelope and really so that less invasive nature of the procedure is a massive advantage. And many surgeons will pick up on that. They are anecdotally seeing that with their patients and I know that the competitive offering will still have a jig, and ours is a jigless offering. So I do believe our features are going to win out at least in the short-term. Will that have interest? Sure. Some surgeons will be interested and will have to obviously compete in the market, but we like our chances. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks so much. So two questions on revenue for me. Kevin, I just wanted to come back to Trauma for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, the softest quarter in years given all the strength you've had here. I think it cost the corporation 50 bps of growth in the quarter, so I think it's a single biggest disconnect versus our model this quarter. You talked about some market softness. One of your competitors talked about market softness, but you also mentioned some supply issues. So if you could just sort of flesh out what's happening in Trauma this particular quarter? And what underpins your confidence that this business reaccelerates here over the immediate term? And then I have a quick follow-up. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Yeah, thanks, David. Yeah, we were \u2013 obviously we're a little disappointed with our Trauma performance this quarter. We've had about five years of phenomenal growth. If you look at the comps, we had a big quarter in the third quarter last year, very strong double-digit growth. So comps has a little bit to do with it, but we did have some supply disruption. We expect to resolve that and that really did affect our overall business. Our Extremities business grew a little less than 10%, which hasn't happened for a long time, but we expected that that's going to pick up as we move forward. We also have a number of new products that we're launching. So we have a very strong Trauma team. There's still a very healthy business overall. The market did slow down a little bit. We saw that frankly since June. That has happened in the past. It's been transitory, but we still feel very good about that business. And we are optimistic especially behind new product launches. We have a number of new products that we'll be launching going into next year. That business will pick back up again, and even at this level, we're still outperforming the market leader. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And Kevin, the supply issues resolved in the fourth quarter, they're not fully resolved until early part of 2019? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: I would say largely resolved in the fourth quarter. And so you'll see some pickup in the fourth quarter. They will be even more noticeable in 2019. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is open. Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon, Kevin. Maybe I'll start with Mako again as well. With the steel upgrades completed maybe with the resources freed up that this suggests that you have resources to more aggressively new accounts? And maybe talk about the Mako penetration theoretical ceiling, I think you are like 15% of the potential 4,000 accounts or so. Any thoughts on the realistic feeling for Mako? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: It's tough to say, Rick. There's clearly a lot of runway because it's not only placing a robot in the thousands of hospitals in just the U.S. let alone globally, but also as more and more surgeons in the practice want to use the robot then you start to see what is clearly the minority right now, they try to purchase multiple robots. And we have some hospitals that are further along in their robotic programs that are doing that or have done that. So a lot of runway for robot placements. You are correct with the upgrades complete. That sales force will be focused now on placing new robots. So again, we feel like we've got a strong ability to continue to drive some meaningful market share gains. We still have to train and hire the service side. But overall, we think we've got a very healthy pipeline of demand here and ability to continue to place pretty significant new robots. Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just as a follow-up, Kevin, the Invuity acquisition, this is the company we thought have always felt the technology is outstanding. Maybe, if you could talk to us a little bit about the acquisition rationale. And maybe just in a larger sense, how does this fit into your long-term strategy or vision about at least one of your \u2013 one of the strategies in terms of where you might be taking Stryker's portfolio going forward? Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So thanks, Rick. Yeah, we absolutely love the lighted retractors. They are very novel, very innovative, provides tremendous benefits to the clinician. In addition, they have entered the advanced energy space with a very novel product. Our Instruments business, as you know, has been a very strong performer for a very long period of time. They are now actually focused on waste management as well as they have a surgical procedure. And now this product fits very well with that call point. We call it Surgical Technologists. It's one of the business units. And then you have the focus on power tools and Steri-Shield and so it really does fit very well with the existing call point of those Instruments salespeople. And so we believe it's a really novel technology that's in a high-growth space. And our call point, our reps are actually in that area. And so it really plugs really into that \u2013 into existing sales force. And most of the deals we do when we have existing products \u2013 existing sales forces that we can plug products into, those are the ones that we tend to really grow very, very quickly. So we are excited about it. It's not wildly outside of our call point, but it will enable us to enter into even more surgical procedures than we do today. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please proceed. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Katherine, the initial trickle of Mako data has been pretty compelling albeit with some relatively small patient numbers. Can you talk about what's in the pipeline from a data perspective? Are there big studies that you guys have circled as being key to making the case with physicians that might still be on the fence about the clinical value there? And when could we expect to see those? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So I think you're going to see a steady cadence on the clinical side. And what you're seeing right now given where we are on the launch are the early outcomes, those 90-day outcomes. But we're also with the KOLs who were initiated studies as part of the launch we are collecting data and then eventually there will be two year data. So I think what you should expect to see is a steady cadence here. We were really thrilled particularly with the first study. I noted that that was just 40 patients in each arm and it still hits statistical significance on all the endpoints favorable to Mako. So I think we're just going to continue to build on this. And then as we get further obviously into the launch and have two-year clinical data possibly by August of next year, that's really what you need to have to get published in peer-reviewed journals. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And then you called out the easy comp for Sage this quarter, the contribution to growth that represented. My recollection is that 4Q should also be a pretty easy comp there. Can you just remind us of the timing of when that normalizes? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. The fourth quarter will be an easier comp. It won't be as easy as the third quarter, so the biggest impact was the third quarter last year. And then there was some recovery in the fourth quarter, but yes, there will be a benefit to us of an easier comp in the fourth quarter. And then normalization would really occur sort of sometime in the middle of next year. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one question on Mako and I had a follow-up. So it looks like sequentially system placements were down. And it looks- seems to be U.S. was down maybe in international was off. I'm just curious on what's you see now if you are \u2013 or how should we be thinking of system placements? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: I think we really need to look year-over-year. Q3 is always the seasonally softest quarter for reconstructive. There's a long history of that. There's just simply fewer hip and knee procedures done during the summer months and correspondingly Q4 you typically see a very meaningful step-up given that's a strong capital quarter as a hospital use up the year-end budgets, it's a strong quarter for hip and knee procedures. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : That's helpful. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We're feeling very good. The interest level is very high and we expect to continue to be able to have robust sales of our Mako robot. Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC : That's helpful, Kevin. And then maybe one on margin. So I think, Glenn, you're mentioning on the commitments of 30 bps to 50 bps of margin expansion. As you think about where rates are right now and when we look at 2019 and the deals that you've done, are we still on track for 30 bps to 50 bps? I think there's been some confusion on the Street about the commitment of 30 bps to 50 bps for 2019? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. We're not. Based on where we are to-date and what we know is in the pipeline, we have not changed the long-term guidance of 30 bps to 50 bps for 2019. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good afternoon. Kevin, I had a question on K2M. You're doubling down on Spine with the K2 acquisition. Is this a signal that you feel more optimistic about the outlook for the spine market and now was the right time to do the deal? Or was this more signal that spine is strategic synergistic with Orthopaedic and Neuro and you just needed to get bigger. So that's my question and I had a quick follow-up. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think we've \u2013 I've been pretty consistent over the past three years or four years in how important and committed Stryker was to the spine market. It is very synergistic with both Neurotechnology and as well as Orthopaedic and we're seeing that with a terrific performance of our Tritanium products which is 3D-printed technology that we also use in Orthopaedics. And so this has been a market we're very committed to. The timing just worked out very well for us right now. We've got our spine business starting to perform better. K2M has really developed stronger and stronger performance with their new product launches. So the timing just came together right now. Deals vary from when you start to get interested in the company, you get to know the company. We've obviously gotten to know Eric very well and we're bringing him on to be the CEO of the combined organization based on what he's built there, his culture, the way he runs his operations. So, culturally very similar to how Stryker operates. And when you're doing a large integration, where you're bringing together two organizations of size or you are going to be using the same types of technologies, culture really doesn't matter a lot. And so it took us time to make sure that we have a cultural fit. And so I'm very optimistic about the two organizations merging very well and performing very well. But there really hasn't been a change strategically. It's always been important. I think I've said that over and over again. The market, it's nice to see that the market is stabilizing and hopefully will start to improve. But this is a deal that makes sense for us. It will really improve our growth trajectory in our Spine business. And it just felt like a good time to do it and we're very excited about it. Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just as a follow-up both K2 and Stryker are very big into 3D printing. Are there any FTC issues there? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: No, we don't anticipate any. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks. First a question on Mako and then a follow-up on the Neurotech. On the Mako side, can you maybe give us an update as to the mix of sort of leased versus outright purchases that you are seeing for the incremental users? And the reason I ask is I'm interested how you think that will evolve as the market gets a little more crowded in the coming months? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, so one of the benefits besides of the capital, we have a capital sales force and an implant sales force. We also have our Flex Financial group which has existed for years to work with customers making big capital purchases. Not just the robot, but a number of MedSurg offerings and they can work depending on the needs of the customer between outright purchases and leases. So some of the robots, the majority are filled, but we have different arrangements. We're not going to get into a breakdown of that primarily for competitive reasons but the ability of our Flex Financial group to work with the customers is a big part of the strategy that we have. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, helpful. And then just a follow-up. You have a new product cycle in Neurotech that's I'm assuming been part of the growth story there, correct me if I'm wrong this quarter, obviously pretty good. I think you said just about 17% in the U.S. part of the business. I'm interested in what's going on in terms of the new stroke devices you have is obviously very strong incumbent there. So give a little color as to the nature of market share, overall acceleration of product category, what you're seeing there would be interesting. Thank you. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes. So the neurovascular group is just having a tremendous year. I would tell you both hemorrhagic and ischemic had very solid double-digit growth and it's across the board. Broadly speaking, ischemic is more about market expansion. If you look at hemorrhagic probably one of the standout products is the Atlas adjunctive stent that we launched in the first quarter, early part of the first quarter. We did get to surpass for delivering stent approved. That will launch as we ramp up product and start to work with the early users late this year, early part of next year. So you do know real impact from that in the U.S. in the quarter. And then we're just in a very early stages of launching our aspiration product and that's really meant to target customers that really want to use aspiration first. And we still believe the most effective given the clinical data is to use the stentriever in combination. But there is a subset of patients or customers that went out alone, but we're just too early in that launch. So that wasn't a driver. Certainly, as we look ahead to 2019 given the continued momentum we are seeing, market expansion in ischemic and then the recent new launches, we feel really good about Neuro heading into next year despite what will be some pretty impressive comparisons. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, could you give us a little bit of color please on FX in 2019? We estimate it's about a 70 basis point headwind. Any color on the EPS impact at this point and the tax rate in 2019, I heard your comment about 18% underlying year-to-date but the reported has been better. Any color on that for 2019? And then Katherine, just my second question now. Preview of the Analyst Meeting on November 8, just will you give some color on 2019 and beyond from a financial perspective? Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Sure, Larry. So if you look at FX and sort of based on the foreign currency exchange rates, we expect a slight negative impact on sales due to foreign currency translation which will have a negligible impact on EPS in the fourth quarter. And what we're seeing really at the EPS line is we're seeing negative translational FX but is being offset by a positive transactional FX from our hedging program. And these impacts have all been included in the fourth quarter guidance that I referred to. Flipping to taxes, as we look at the full year guidance that we provided at the beginning of this year of 16.5% to 17.5% for our effective tax rate, we expect that our effective rate will end the year at the lower end of that range. And really what we're seeing is compared to 2017 we're seeing sort of a slightly higher effective tax rate just really just driven by the new tax legislation. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: And for the Analyst Meeting, we won't be giving guidance \u2013 formal guidance for 2019. That will be, as it always is, on our earnings call in January. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. We spent a lot of time talking about Knees and the impact of Mako on that business. Can you give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about your Hip franchise? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes, sure. So we launched our Trident II, our new hip cup in the second quarter. It really started to ramp in the third quarter. When I say ramp, these launches do take time because you have to get the sets of Instruments out. We're now about 1,000 sets in the field. You saw a slight tick up in our hip number in the third quarter and I do expect that that will continue to perform very well. The feedback that we're getting on the cup is terrific. We already have a very good stem portfolio which, as you know, drove us to have outperformance in the market for a number of years. And then we sort of grew in line with the market for the last couple of years. But this cup is being very well received. We now are fully \u2013 the field is fully stocked with their sets and we started to see a little bit of impact in the third quarter and I think you will continue to see us tick up in our hip business. Of course, the same sales force also focus on knees. And knees is obviously where a lot of action is but we do expect continued moderate sequential uptick with our hip business. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. And then in terms of M&A, it's no secret you guys have been pretty active with what I would call sort of tuck-ins along the lines of K2M. And I think sort of outside your core businesses such as Invuity, how are you thinking about acquisitions on a go-forward basis? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Very consistent with what we've been doing. The vast majority of the deals tend to be relatively small to midsize. They tend to be tuck-in to an existing sales and marketing infrastructure with the occasional larger bits that we have done. And I think as you look forward, you should assume very similar pattern. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yes. And I would say with Invuity, it is a slightly different technology, but it is a call point. We already have our sales force calling in that area. And so it's not broadly different. We'd love to bring technologies into existing sales forces. That has been a real key formula for success for Stryker for a long time. So it's not really as adjacent as a Physio-Control or a Sage business. We're actually tucking this within our Instruments sales force. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please proceed. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. You guys have made some comments in the past about looking to accelerate the growth in the Spine business. Obviously, K2 plays into that but maybe talk a little bit sort of what are the drivers to move that Spine growth rate up? And I think you talked about wanting it to be above the corporate average. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: So within Spine, innovation always wins. And if you look our Tritanium products even the Serrato new products will be re-launched. Innovations were awarded in Spine. And you have seen that across \u2013 you can look across the Spine companies. If you provide a good cadence of innovation, you will win in the Spine business. There's still a huge amount of unmet needs. It's the biggest market within Orthopaedics and that's why we like K2. Obviously, it gives us a bit more market share. They are stronger in certain parts of the country where we are weaker. And so that obviously you have a sales force that can sell a broader range of products that is exciting and should increase our growth. But also they have a really good R&D engine that produces consistent flow of new products. And that's going to be the formula for success. It's not unique to Stryker. I think if you look across the Spine market, innovation is really what gets rewarded. And we're committed to continuing to drive innovation within the Spine business. But on a combined basis, we're going to have a lot more impact as a combined organization than we would have separately. Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, very good. And then Katherine, I'm just wondering there's certainly been enough experience now with the Mako robots that are being placed. What's your \u2013 I guess what I am trying to understand is sort of what's the right way to think about how docs ramp up on the procedure? Certainly, you give the utilization rates so we get that. But do they tend to do a couple of cases and then wait and then start to grow their cases more? Just trying to get a feel for how that's kind of working in the field. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, what you see is clearly they have an interest because they are going to be the surgeon champion, we have the robot charges. But they don't get trained and then suddenly show up Monday morning and they are doing all of their knee procedures on the robot. It's a gradual process. They might do five old way and one that day and as they slowly get more and more comfortable with it, so it varies, but it could take anywhere from 12 months to 18 months for them to really be fully flipped over to using it exclusively for all their procedures. And then the challenge also becomes maybe with the surgeon champion and he can get the robot whenever he wanted, and then slowly his colleagues start to close in and want to use it. And so sometimes they are limited in how many cases, they can do on a robot because they don't have enough robot time and that's usually the precursor to the hospital bringing in another robot. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Your line is open. Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to go back to just clarify a couple of things. On the tax rate, Glenn, I think you were saying that you're expecting to come in at the low end of the range, but you are seeing a higher tax rate. Is the difference, I don't know if I understood that correctly, is the difference just the stock compensation impact on the tax lien? Or how do we kind of think about that on a go-forward basis? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, the real \u2013 the largest difference between sort of our effective tax rate which is what I guide to and then I had mentioned the operating tax rate is really the impact of stock compensation. The difference is there. That's by far one of the largest item. Kristen Stewart - Barclays Investment Bank : Okay. And what's the delta expected to be this year between the two again? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: At the upper end of our range, it's 50 bps. It can be as much as 100 basis points difference. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink. Please proceed. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to circle back to the Trauma Extremities. Can you parse out with it between Trauma versus Extremities, both where the slowdown is most pronounced, it's kind of two sets of product categories. And then also where the supply issue was more pronounced as well again between Trauma or product lines within Trauma and Extremities? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question but we don't break out Trauma and Extremities separately. There were supply issues on both size and product launches coming on both sides. And both sides had difficult year-over-year comparisons. Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And just with respect to the market slowdown, any additional color that you can kind of give there with respect to timing or what's happening there. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, we're struggling a little bit too. And I think we referenced events into June. The market just feels so slowed down. And this has happened over the years where we have these periods for whatever the reason maybe the market growth seems to slow a bit. So there's nothing that we could really point to right now, but as the results come in, it does seem to support the view that the market did slow down in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed. Craig William Bijou - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to start with the HyperBranch acquisition, you guys didn't really talk about it and I recognize it's relatively small in comparison to the entire company. But maybe just strategy there and how that fits into your portfolio? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. Sure. So that fits within our CMF business, our craniomaxillofacial business which is a business that we report within our Neurotechnology segment. We've had fantastic growth within that business unit over the past five years double-digit growth pretty much every single year and this was just a product gap. So we did not have a dural sealant product. There's only one other product on the market for dural sealant. So we've known this company HyperBranch for many years. We've been following them and we're very excited to add that product. It's absolute tuck-in to our existing CMF business and our CMF sales force. Craig William Bijou - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, pricing it looked like you got \u2013 it did get a little bit worse during the quarter. So, anything to call out there? Or any changes to your expectations going forward on price? Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. No, I think fundamentally we sort of ended price where we thought we would. Obviously, mix plays into that. But for the full year, there's no change in what we're thinking. Craig William Bijou - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please proceed. Mike Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask a couple about the K2 deal. I guess, first, we've seen with Spine deals is that there tend to be a lot of dissynergies. So, I just wonder if you could shed any light of kind of what your assumptions there are around what that business is going to look like in the first 12 months to 24 months when you integrate the two companies. How much of the commodities sales do you expect to lose? And then I noticed in the press release you commented on some dilution for this year, but you didn't really comment on whether you expected the deal to be accretive or dilutive beyond 2018? So, is that just because there's just too much uncertainty around these dissynergies and things like that? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: So, a couple of points. So, we did affirm our long-term guidance inclusive of K2M next year of 30 basis points to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. In terms of \u2013 we're not going to break out the assumptions around sales dis-synergies. There's always some as you integrate. What was really attractive about this target is we have very minimal customer overlap which really helps. And then we also have a model where we're used to having both agents and direct sales reps who are comfortable working in that model, it's how our own Spine business works and I think that will help as we look to integrate the sales force. And then lastly, bringing Eric in to run the business. He obviously has a very sales execution-driven culture. We have something very similar, but a sales force that is really thrilled to have a refresh to their product portfolio and then broader footing in the degenerative deformity segment of the market that really drives a lot of the thought leaders. So, when you add that all together along with our experience in doing deals and integrating deals, we think that will help to limit the dis-synergies and ensure that this integration goes well and we get back to above-market growth. Mike Matson - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on robotics and Mako. So, look, I understand kind of the single-minded focus here on recon, specifically on the Total Knee, but we're seeing other companies, there's a few spine robots out there, there's about to be another one. So, I've got to imagine you're working on, bringing Mako, particularly into Spine, maybe other areas. Can you just comment on your strategy there? Thanks. Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes, you are right, we are very focused right now in optimizing the launch of the Knee given the enormity of the market, our head-start, and the advantages of our robot. But we also have previously stated we have R&D projects actively underway looking at applications for the robot in both Spine as well as Shoulder. We're not in a position to talk about the timing of that, but this robot has a number of applications and we're going to be continuing to expand it. But right now, the focus really is on the Total Knee. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: And as it relates to timing, we really would like to come to the market with something that's really meaningful and not so interested in having an offering that's similar to what's existing on the marketplace. So, even if it takes us a little bit longer, but to provide a much more meaningful benefit, that's what we're more concerned with. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed. Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks and good evening. I was hoping to just ask quickly about Total Knee is moving off the inpatient-only list by Medicare this year. Have you seen any type of impact in the market? Clearly it has an impact to Stryker's Knee business, but has there been an impact in the marketplace over the first three quarters of this year? And do you see it as a risk to the Total Knee market going forward? Is there anything that AvMed or American Hospital Association can do to help improve that HOPD reimbursement level? And then my follow-up question is that there have been concerns that one of your competitors is on a path to recovery. And I just wanted to hear from you if you'd seen any incremental competitive headwinds in the Orthopaedic franchise from that competitor? Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: So maybe I'll start with your last question. I would say if you look at our numbers and you look at our performance, we really just are focused on our own offense. We're focused on driving Mako, we're focused on 3D printing. And as long as we do that, we keep growing and we're growing very well. And so I would say that's we're going to continue to focus on our offense. And it's really irrespective of what's going on around us. We haven't seen anything, any material change as we approach our customers. What was the first question, sorry? Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC: Total Knees. Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.: Oh, inpatient. So, no, we haven't seen any major dynamic change because it's really hospital inpatient only. Medicare still doesn't as you know cover procedures in the surgery centers. If that change were to occur, I think that would create a more meaningful shift. But we're already starting to place Makos in surgery centers and that's the space we know fairly well from our sports medicine franchise. And so that would be the bigger change if that was to occur. We don't see that sort of in the short-term happening. Overall, the market is actually fairly healthy, fairly stable. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed. William G. Inglis - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. This is Will on for Matt. So Neurotech, obviously, continues to be a monster growth driver. Can you talk about some of the other products that are really accelerating growth besides ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke? Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Sure. And within our Instruments business, we have a couple of terrific products. Our neuro power drills are doing extremely well. We have our SONOPET product for tumor ablation, which is also doing extremely well. We have the malis product, which we have picked up through an acquisition a little while ago, which is called the malis forceps. So really the suite of products that we have for the neurosurgeon, which we \u2013 most of it's been through internal innovation but we've also done some small tuck-ins. That's really driving explosive growth, very strong double-digit growth and I would say the neurosurgical tools, the power tools are growing roughly as fast as our Neurovascular business. And then you have our craniomaxillofacial business growing in the 10%, 11% quarter-after-quarter very steady double-digit growth. So it's really healthy across our portfolio and our businesses are performing very well. William G. Inglis - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, can you elaborate a little bit about the Siemens partnership and the broader strategy specific to spine? Thank you. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah, so we have strategic alliance with them to really provide imaging. So there's \u2013 we don't have \u2013 as you know we don't have a CRM ourselves. And so that really allows us if you \u2013 if we're thinking about competing with the Medtronic that has their arm and they try to bundle their offering with that type of imaging. This provides a very competitive counter to them. So it runs on our portfolio and we use that \u2013 we enjoy that partnership. They have a very, very good product. They make sure that we have a complete and competitive offering for those accounts that are looking for a bundled offering. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. You may proceed. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hi, guys. So you highlighted emerging markets as a positive driver in the quarter. I know EM is still not a big portion of total sales for you guys. But would you say overall the environment remains healthy despite some of the broader market concerns? Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. So I mean emerging markets for us this is three quarters in a row where we had double-digit growth. But as you've seen in the past it has varied for us. Our performance has been a little bit up and down over the past four years or five years. I feel very good about our business in China. I feel good about our business in Latin America. We've really strengthened it in Turkey and Russia. So there's a number of markets where I think we've really improved our position and that bodes well for the future. India, we just hired a new Managing Director recently. We still have some work to do there to get back on a strong footing. They actually had a pretty decent quarter this quarter, first good quarter in about a year or so in India. But \u2013 so the outlook is still \u2013 is positive. It's going to take us some time. We really haven't made the same degree of investments as other large med tech players, but the market conditions themselves are quite good. And we like our chances to continue to improve our performance in emerging markets. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. And then, just on Sage, obviously, a lot of volatility here in the last few quarters that you're now coming out from under. How should we think about the sustainable growth of that business, now with some of the issues behind you guys? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yes. So as we regain the market share and get back in the offence later in 2019, we absolutely believe this will still be a double-digit growth business. Operator : Thank you. And your next call comes from Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Please proceed. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask another follow-up on the Mako side. Our competitor in the Spine side of robotics recently talked about leveraging the robot as a means to drive share. I know, obviously, when you've talked about goal of taking hundreds of share points with Mako, but the competitor talked about being open to different business models rather than outright capital sale. I know you touched on the Flex Financial, but it sounded like they were more approaching it from a volume-based agreement, given X% of procedural share over the course of the next several years and we'll place the robot. Are you seeing those types of requests? Have they changed at all? And how do you view that as a business model moving forward when the market gets a little more competitive with new entrants? Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.: Yeah. I think, first and foremost, it all starts not with the financing options. It starts with what is your robot capable of doing and what value does it bring. And then, increasingly, what kind clinical data do you have. And we're not going to get into other people's business models. That will be \u2013 the burden will be on them to demonstrate first what the robot can do. Secondly, when will they start to have clinical data? We have Flex Financial. We've had that for years. It's been a tremendous benefit to us, as well as knowing how to sell capital and having a dedicated capital sales force. And that flexibility to meet the needs of our customers, I think, with roughly 600 or close to 600 robots globally and what we have in the pipeline. Our model is working for us and that's what we're going to stay focused on. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Operator : Okay. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, Stryker continues to deliver strong financial results. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2018 results will be held on January 29, 2019. Additionally, we hope you can join us on November 8 for our 2018 Analyst Meeting and Product Fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako and our recently completed acquisition of K2M. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. 2018 was a stellar year for Stryker. Following tough comparisons from a successful 2017, we delivered impressive organic sales growth and leveraged adjusted earnings gains. Our talented team has launched new products, drove sales and marketing execution and benefited from prior acquisitions that are broadened our portfolios. We delivered organic sales growth of 8.6% in Q4 and grew full year organic sales by nearly 8%. Importantly, this performance reflected broad-based strength across divisions and regions. MedSurg had an excellent Q4, up 10% organically as a three large divisions Endoscopy, Instruments, and Medical grow between 9% and 12%. MedSurg results reflect strong commercial excellence, ability to steadily launch new products and successfully integrate acquisitions. For example, the Physio-Control business within Medical grew double digits in 2018. In 2019, MedSurg will have a similar flow of new products and endoscopy will launch its next-generation camera the 1688 at the end of the first quarter. Neurotechnology and Spine increased over 8% organically as Neurovascular CMS and Interventional Spine all registered double-digit organic growth. We're excited about the acquisition of K2M, which meaningfully enhances our competitive position in the spine market. Orthopaedics posted solid Q4 organic growth of 7% led by Trauma and Extremities, knees increasing momentum in hips and excellent Mako growth which Kathy will detail shortly. U.S. Trauma and Extremities achieved major milestone crossing $1 billion in sales for the first time in 2018, resulting from a multi-year period of terrific growth. Geographically, our Q4 growth was balanced as the U.S. was up 8% organically, while international delivered double-digit gains powered by emerging markets and Europe. On a full year basis, emerging markets grew double-digits and Europe once again grew high-single digits. When combined with strong performances in South Pacific, Japan and Canada full year international organic growth was higher than U.S. growth. Our focus on leveraging the strong top line was evident in Q4 as operating margin increased 30 basis points year-over-year despite significant deal dilution including K2M. Meanwhile, we continue to make meaningful investments in our sales forces and R&D to help ensure we maintain our revenue growth going forward. Our teams remain highly focused on executing our cost transformation for growth program, which combined with our top line performance allowed us to deliver EPS at the high-end of our targeted range at $2.18 a share, up 11% year-over-year. Turning to 2019, organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, representing the highest initial revenue growth guide for Stryker in a decade. Of note, we exited 2018 with a healthy order book for our capital businesses and have a similar mix of headwinds and tailwinds as we had entering last year. While 2019 will largely be an integration year as it relates to K2M, the team is off to an impressive start with notable excitement across our combined selling organizations. And despite sizable dilutive dilution, we fully expect to achieve our target of 30 to 50 basis points of annual operating margin expansion. With sales growth once again expected to be at the high end of MedTech and ongoing margin expansion, we are targeting full year adjusted EPS of $8 to $8.20 a share, a year-over-year increase of 10% to 12%. In closing, I want to thank our sales, marketing, R&D and support teams around the world for their efforts and results in 2018, enabling us to deliver on our commitment to stakeholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on our Q4 acquisitions of K2M as well as our Mako performance. In November, we completed the acquisition of K2M for roughly $1.4 billion, which significantly bolsters our competitive position in the spinal market. K2M provides Stryker with a highly complementary and innovative product portfolio that is resonating with our customers and spinal sales force. The teams have focused on optimizing the integration and we are leveraging our years of deal experience to ensure we are moving quickly to align the organization. We have made considerable progress since closing, including establishing the spine global senior leadership team of the combined organization. We are actively building out the remainder of the organization which should be completed by the end of the first quarter. Importantly, the sales leadership organizational structure has been announced along with their respective territories. The leadership team is working with the sales teams across the globe to align the sales force with our hybrid selling model and we expect this to be completed in Q1. Additionally, the cross-selling plan related to the comprised product portfolio is in its early stages and additional cross-selling progress will be made throughout the quarter. We remain on track with our deal model and expect our combined pro forma core spinal revenue to deliver mid-single-digit growth in 2019. We will provide a further update at AAOS as Eric Major, President of Stryker Spine, will be precipitating in our booth tour and will be available for Q&A. Turning to Mako, we had a particularly strong performance in Q4 with 54 robots installed globally, a record level with over 40% in competitive account. Geographically, the U.S. led the way with 36 robots versus 27 in the prior years. Globally, we now have 642 robots installed with 523 in the U.S., the majority of which have been upgraded to the Total Knee system. During the quarter, we certified roughly 250 surgeons on the Total Knee, bringing the total number of surgeons trained since launch to approximately 1,600. There were roughly 24,800 robotic procedures performed in the U.S. during the quarter with full year of Mako procedures topping 76,900. Mako Total Knee procedures increased over 35% sequentially to approximately 15,500 with knees representing roughly 60% of all Mako procedures performed in the U.S. in 2018. We also saw continued uptick in utilization rates on the robots, which climbed over 25% sequentially in Q4 and up 30% year-over-year. The ability to perform a cementless Total Knee on the robot, which was approved by the FDA in Q4 2017 is also helping to further drive cementless knee adoption as we exited to 2018 with over 30% of our knees now are cementless. Combined, we believe these data underscore that Mako is undoubtedly a powerful marketing tool for hospital that continued demand for the robot and steady acceleration in the utilization by surgeon is being driven more by the powerful clinical results and patient benefit. Looking ahead to 2019, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to drive Mako momentum as we exited the year with a healthy orders pipeline for the robot. During the year we saw strong peer review evidence that Mako Total Knee delivered better clinical outcomes for patients and lower 90-day cost of care, which benefits the pair. We expect to continue to build on the clinical data in support of Mako as we pass the two-year mark on the full commercial launch of our Total Knee application later this quarter. We look to further update you at the boot towards AAOS, which will include Mako and also anticipate further clinical data to be presented at August later in 2019. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Katherine. Today I'll focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 8.6% in the quarter. As a reminder this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2017. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.5% from the prior year while foreign currency had an unfavorable 1.2% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 7.8%, reflecting solid performance across our portfolio. International sales grew 10.9% organically, which was balanced across our international regions. Organic sales growth for the year was 7.9%, which exceeded our most recently raised full year guidance of 7% to 7.5%. U.S. organic growth was 7.5% and the international organic growth was 8.8%. 2018 had the same number of days as 2017 and price had a 1.4% impact on sales for the full year. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.18 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong leverage on sales growth combined with good operating expense control. Our fourth quarter EPS had no significant impact from foreign exchange rates either translational or transactional, which was consistent with our expectations. Our full year EPS of $7.31 increased 12.6%, reflecting strong sales growth and disciplined leverage. Now, we'll provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency and organic growth of 7% including organic growth of 7% in the U.S. This performance was highlighted by strong performances in Trauma and Extremities of 7.1%. Additionally, U.S. hips grew at 4%, U.S. knees grew 5.8% and our other orthopedic business grew 44.2%. Within the knee business we continue to see strong demand for our Mako Total Knee platform and our 3D-printed products. Internationally, Orthopaedics delivered organic growth of 6.9%, which reflects solid performances in Europe, emerging markets and Canada. MedSurg continued to have strong growth across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 11.1% and organic gains of 10.1%, which included an 8.5% increase in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%. We had exceptional growth in our waste management surg account and surgical power businesses. Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 5.3% with strong performances across its sports medicine, communications and ProCare businesses. As expected Endo\u2019s video business moderated as our customers prepared for the late Q1 launch of our next-generation 1688 camera system. Of note however with the NOVADAQ video system which had robust double-digit growth during the quarter. Medical had U.S. organic growth of 12.3% reflecting solid performance and its bed, stretchered, EMS and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.7% with strong performances in Europe, Australia and emerging markets. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 21.4% driven by our K2M acquisition and organic growth of 8.4%. This growth reflects strong performance within our NeuroTech product lines which had organic growth of 11.2%. Our U.S. NeuroTech business posted organic growth of 7.3% for the quarter driven by strong demand for our hemorrhagic, ischemic stroke, CMF and our Neuro Powered Instruments. We continue to be pleased with the progress of our Entellus commercial execution and integration. Our spine business saw moderate pricing pressure in the quarter offset by double-digit growth of our IVF business and our Tritanium implant products. We made significant progress on our integration of K2M and this will continue in 2019. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 10.6%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand in Europe, China and Japan. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. As noted in the press release and discussed in our first quarter 2018 earnings call, the adoption of ASC 606 primarily had the impact of reclassifying certain expenses from SG&A to sale. As such, all references to basis points improvements are net of this impact. You should note that for 2019 the ASC 606 reconciliation in our press release will no longer be required. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.6% was unfavorable 55 basis points from prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by acquisitions, but offset by price, foreign exchange and business mix. For the full year, our adjusted gross margin of 66% was in line with the prior year and was primarily impacted by price and business mix. R&D spending was 5.7% of sales which was 30 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. For the full year R&D spending was 6.3% of sales which was 10 basis points lower than prior year. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.4% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 55 basis points. For the full year, our adjusted SG&A was 33.9% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year by approximately 30 basis points. Both the quarter and the year, this reflects the continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth CTG program including key projects focused on indirect purchasing and shared services. This is offset by the negative impact of acquisitions and continued planned investments in other CTG program like our ERP project and our PLCM project. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.5% of sales which was 30 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Our full year operating margin was up 40 basis points from the prior year, delivering on our commitment of 30 to 50 basis points margin expansion. Our operating margin primarily reflects good leverage and continued operational savings, offset by investments and acquisitions. The latter of which had an approximately 50 basis points negative impact for the quarter and the year. Next, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Net interest income and expense decreased from prior year quarter primarily due to favorable interest rates. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% was in line with our operating tax rate. Our full year effective tax rate was 16.7% which reflects benefits primarily from stock compensation expenses. We anticipate an effective tax rate of 16% to 17% in 2019 which includes the benefit from optimization of our geographical operations and stock compensation expenses. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 25% was held outside of the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet was $9.9 billion, of which $1.25 billion relates to maturities that will be paid off in Q1 2019. Upon completion of this, we anticipate total debt to be approximately $8.65 billion. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.6 billion. This reflects increased earnings which are somewhat offset by increases in working capital, including higher tax payments as a result of tax reform and specifically required payments related to the U.S. toll tax on previously untaxed profits. In January 2019, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be $600 million to $650 million in 2019. And now I will provide 2019 guidance. Based on our momentum from 2018 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for 2019. This growth will vary by quarter as we typically see stronger quarters in Q3 and Q4, especially given new product ramping and acquisition anniversaries. As you update your quarterly models please note that Q1, Q2 and Q4 have the same number of selling days while Q3 has one more selling day. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% in 2019 and EPS to be negatively impacted from $0.00 to $0.10 per share for the full year and $0.02 to $0.04 for the first quarter. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1% to 1.5%, which is fairly consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2018. In addition, we expect to continue to deliver on our full year commitment to expand operating margin. Including the negative impact of our current acquisitions, we anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2019. We expect that acquisition integration activities will have a bigger negative impact on operating margin during the first half of 2019. Finally, for 2019, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8 to $8.20 for the full year, including approximately $1.80 to $1.85 for the first quarter. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first call comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Robbie Marcus : Thanks so much, and congrats on the great quarter. So at the November Analyst Day, you told us that 2019 was going to look very much like 2018 and you've delivered on that promise with guidance very much in line with 2018. Can you give us a little bit of puts and takes in what are the key drivers on the top line for next year that we should be aware of by business? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think if you look at it overall, we do very similar headwinds tailwinds, we have some employing product cycles that we're going into with no endoscopy is getting up to launch the next generation camera, the 1688, which will happen by the end of the first quarter. So that will be significant for them. We finished the year on Orthopaedics with a very healthy order book across our capital businesses including Mako. So it's 54 robots in the quarter and a healthy order book, we expect another strong year for Mako and we\u2019re seeing an acceleration in our hips given the launch of our 3D-printed cup that has been really well received, and so that will be a driver. We've launched several new Trauma products and including a new instrumentation nailing system that was launched late in the fourth quarter and that help drive the accelerations sequentially in Trauma and will be a faster as we look to this year. And then if you look across the board into the MedSurg businesses there's a lot of momentum across the board. Neurovascular has multiple product launches, we're still seeing strong momentum with Atlas they're also getting up for the launch of the respiration system and related accessories there. Medical has new product launches happening with Physio-Control, our new AEGG that's out at AAOS and is launching in the U.S. as well as continued acceleration in Sage as we move past them at the regulatory challenges we had. And then instrument is really benefiting from really expanded product portfolio on the heels of several acquisitions. And then, obviously, we're also looking for continued acceleration in spine to get to that pro forma spine revenue growth of 5% for 2019. So there is no one single thing that we really are a number of singles and doubles, the totality of which is really allowing for the strong top line, which we believe will again be at the high end of med tech. Robbie Marcus : All right, great. And then Glenn, a financial question for you. I know you don't guide by the different line items on the P&L, but with the couple of deals that are getting integrated and it looks like a gross margin that came in a little bit below the strain in the fourth quarter, can you give us some high-level thoughts of how we should we be thinking about the P&L? And as we think about operating margin expansion, what's the underlying versus the M&A impact for next year? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. So we don't specifically guide on gross margin, but I would tell you keep in mind the gross margins really impacted by many factors, the largest of these really being mix price and just productivity and efficiency. If we think about the programs we have in place to improve gross margin as well as operating expenses, I've break them into two categories, gross margin is really impacted by our product lifecycle management programs and our plant network programs. Those really provide a longer period before the benefits really kick in. Do you think about operating expenses savings will be driven by improved sales leverage plus programs that we have around indirect spend and shared services. And most of these we've started to see some savings. So on the negative side though, M&A will continue to impact our off margin negatively, especially in the near term as we see sort of the impacts from operating expenses on acquisitions as we seek to really ramp sales on those acquisitions. So I would say, in summary, in the near-term we probably see more opportunities out of operating expenses near term, but over the longer term we'll drive better savings at the gross margin line. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed. Bob Hopkins : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Kevin, if it's okay, I wanted to start with just a little bit of an overview. I mean, obviously, it was an exceptional performance in the quarter and for the year. The company is obviously executing very well, really seeing strength across businesses and geographies. I guess my question is, is this all sort of Stryker execution and product flow? Or do you also think that the markets that you're participating in are having some \u2013 showing some good momentum? Maybe talk a little bit about like the health of capital markets, health of growth markets, because it seems pretty obvious you're executing well, I'm curious how much of this is also just healthy markets as well? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Thanks, Bob. As you've seen over the past six years, we've consistently outperform the market somewhere between 200, 250 basis points. And that's been an every-year thing. This year we exited the-year feeling very, very bullish about doing the same again next year. But markets in MedTech have moved up a little bit over each of the last few years. So I would say the market outlook is healthy. Our order book is a good sign of that, the fact that our capital order book is very good. Look at something like beds and stretchers with double-digit growth and really without any significant new products. There're a couple of minor products, but nothing major. That's really our great execution and I would say fairly healthy markets. What's really different about 2018 is the performance that we had outside the United States, which you saw \u2013 we actually grew faster organically than we did inside the U.S. And we had very good U.S. performance. So this has been a multi-year effort to really improve our globalization. Europe, as you know, has been a star for us the last two years, but in addition to that we really stepped it up in Japan and emerging markets, pretty much across the board at terrific performance. So I'm really excited about the ability to sustain this performance outside the U.S. which then complements what we already know is a very, very strong offence inside the U.S. Bob Hopkins : And then, one specific question on knees, since obviously that\u2019s been such a nice visible growth driver for the company. I mean, the Mako numbers are super impressive this quarter in terms of procedures and systems sold. And you grew, I think, your knee franchise just in the high 6s in 2018. When you kind of look at the momentum of the knee business in terms of Mako, in terms of cementless, is there enough momentum in the business that you can continue to outpace the market in knees to the degree that you've been doing in 2018 as you look to 2019? Katherine Owen : Yeah, Bob, that's fully our expectation. We've got, as we mentioned, the strong order book, the amount in clinical data, all the data points that we look to, whether it's utilization rates or growth in surgeons trained are all really positive. So we fully expect to continue to take meaningful market share. It's going to bounce quarter-to-quarter, because the recon market bounces around. We were up against really tough comps in the U.S. this year and still we have to wait for everybody to report, but think we grew by 100 basis points ahead of the market. So that's absolutely the expectation for this year. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, Bob, I'd just add that, we expect that Mako will continue to grow and we\u2019re still in the early stages, not even two years since our full launch. And we also expect cementless to continue to grow. To exit the year over 30% is something that we feel very good about. And frankly, when a competitive surgeon switches, they're changing their implant to learning Mako, a lot of times the initially switch was cemented knees. And once they gain confidence and comfort with Mako, they will then move to cementless. So cementless still has significant runway and surgeons are really, really pleased with the results they're seeing with their patients. And that's what's causing the extra uptick. So we believe 2019 will be another year of strong above-market performances in knees. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis : Great. A question for growth for Kevin and maybe a quick follow-up. So, Kevin as you mentioned you're, obviously, finishing the year with the strongest momentum I think I've seen in several years and the strongest guide in 10 obviously. So if you think about how the business has performed in 2018 relative to 2019? Do you expect the same general relative performance across those business segments from a growth perspective in 2019 versus 2018? Or other significant segments you think will change from a relative perspective? Kevin Lobo : Thanks, David. I would tell you that we've got strong momentum across our businesses. I would expect similar performances out of Orthopaedics, similar performance out of Medical, Endoscopy should move up a little bit given the 1618 launch, but then you've got some really tough comps in some of the Neurotechnology businesses, which I still think will grow very robustly. But perhaps moderate just a year. But overall there is strength everywhere. Really the one business that hasn\u2019t been underperforming as well for us in the past has been spine. Now with K2M acquisition I think that story changes dramatically, starting in 2020. In 2019, we don't report K2M within our organic sales, but what we will provide each quarter our pro forma results. So you can see what the combined business is doing. We expect mid-single-digit performance on a pro forma basis. And then, obviously, in 2020 that will then roll into organic. So we're really excited with the speed of that integration and being able to post these numbers with the spine business that's been essentially flat for the past five years is pretty remarkable. David Lewis : Okay. Kevin, thank. Just two quick follow-ups, one for you and you already talk to \u2013 touch down a little bit, the Neurotech business was probably the only basis, Trauma recovered, so Neurotech was the only business in the fourth quarter that looked like a decelerated that was surprising just in light of the product cadence and momentum there. Maybe you can through that. And then for Glenn, to the extent that MedSurg outperforms in 2019, any concerns that mix-driven pressure was sort of take you out of that 30 to 50 bps range? Or you feel very confident in that 30 to 50 bps of margin? Thanks so much. Glenn Boehnlein : So, on the new Neurotechnology business, I'm very bullish on the prospects in 2019. As Katherine mentioned, Neurovascular is launching a number of exciting new products. We have the Neuro power drills, the CMF business; they're all very healthy businesses. We have Entellus now that\u2019s reported as part of the Neurotechnology business that's doing very well and it\u2019s an integration. Big comps from quarter-to-quarter you'll see a little bit movement, but I would expect continued robust performance there. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. And then, David, on your question on MedSurg, we we've been bouncing that story probably for the last two years as we've pushed forward with a lot of the CTG initiatives. So I do expect robust growth out of MedSurg. The minus there is lower gross margins. But frankly in the operating expense side of MedSurg they perform on a lower level of burden than the orthopedic businesses do. So, overall I think based on what we're forecasting I think we balanced, so that we can deliver the 30 to 50 basis points that we're promising. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. You may proceed. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good afternoon. Maybe to start a little bit with the emerging markets performance in the quarter, double-digit it's been strong now I think for a couple of quarters. So, is there anything in particular if you can point to in terms of those markets and the sustainability of growth in emerging markets for you? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. So we've been working on this, as you know, for a number of years. And all four quarters were double-digit growth this year for Stryker, which really is encouraging as I think about the future. We made a lot of leadership changes in Latin America. Latin America had a terrific year in 2018. Same thing with the EMEA markets. Turkey, we bought out a distributor and they had a very strong performance. Russia is performing very well. China, of course, is the most important of the emerging markets and I would say we had very strong performance in China. A lot of new leadership put in place and even our Trauson business had a nice bounce back year within China. India, we had a tough sort of beginning part of the year, the first couple of quarters. Again, we've made some leadership changes with a new Managing Director and they had a very strong fourth quarter and the outlook is pretty bright. So for us, it's been a story about really getting the talent offense focus in firing and that's been an effort that\u2019s taken us a couple of years. So I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to continue this trend in the emerging markets. And as you know, it represents a very small percentage of Stryker's overall sales at around 6%. And for us, that's a huge opportunity for the future and we're better position in emerging markets than we have been since I've been at Stryker. Raj Denhoy : No. It's helpful. Maybe just if I can follow up with one product area. So medical, no it's not your biggest segment or has been your biggest segment for a while now, but it was also one of your fastest growing, if not the fastest growing, and you mentioned beds and stretchers. But are there other areas within that category in particular that you're seeing really strong performance in whether Sage or other areas? Glenn Boehnlein : Well, I've mentioned in my opening remarks that Physio-Control had double-digit growth, which to me was really exciting. We have a new AED outside of the U.S., but it's only got approval in the U.S. at the end of the year. So we haven't \u2013 didn\u2019t see any of that benefit. So this is really a terrific sales and marketing execution and we've put in some Stryker leaders there a couple of years ago. And they really are driving more of our Stryker's sales culture in a business that already had terrific products. And so that's one highlight. Sage recovered somewhat, but frankly I think we'll have a better year in 2019 then it did in 2018, had a strong fourth quarter but really had to make up for the losses of the regulatory actions of the remediation. And so they had mid-single-digit growth. It was really the other parts that our core Medical business in Physio that had very, very strong performances. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of quick follow-ups on Mako and the strong trends there. Just one, curious to see what the dynamics have been like in the marketplace as surgeons have learned a little bit more -- hospitals a little bit more about this competitive system that has been kind of on track to come to the market. So that was unveiled sort of in the back of the year, curious how that has impacted the U.S.? And then o-U.S. I just thought it was worth noting and maybe talking about, what has been this driver of really a pretty significant step up in system placements overseas? And what's triggering that? And what we should do to -- about modeling that? And then I have one follow-up for spine, if I could. Katherine Owen : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think what we've seen is continued execution and really building on the momentum, given the years that we've been at robotics building on the clinical data with the only robot out there with haptics with the ability to balance the name, or seeing the benefit of that in the clinical data, some of which we talked about on the last call and will continue to see come out throughout this year, particularly as we approach August. And we had a record number of robots in the quarter and we've got a healthy order book. So it isn't any one single factor it is building on the momentum and the clear benefit that surgeons are seeing or continuing to see hospitals purchase second robots, which really speaks to the mounting benefits that the entire surgeon group sees. And that's the same thing driving it outside the U.S. Different geographies, we see different uptake given the different healthcare systems, but clearly we are seeing very healthy growth outside the U.S. I think the U.S. will continue to be the big driver we have a lot of runway. I think it helpful given all the data points we give you around system sales, pricing, utilization rates, surgeons trained that as you look at competitive offering will make it really easy to do a comparison. Glenn Boehnlein : That\u2019s great. And then on - go ahead, Kevin. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Just before you move to spine on that, I\u2019ll just add that we only have small number placements in China and Japan. I think, they're going to be very big markets in the future, but given the regulatory timeline we still don't have approval for the needs. We have approval for hips, which of course are big markets and we've just started to sell there. We also built a training center in Hong Kong that will be used to train surgeons in Asia-Pacific region on Mako. So we're very bullish about the continued growth. I think 2019 may not be a great year in those two markets, certainly at the rest of the world, Latin America, Europe will continue to be good. But I think starting in 2020 you could expect to see a pretty significant uptake in Mako in China and Japan. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s excellent. Thanks. And then on spine, so I guess the question I would ask, you've got a great asset, obviously, in our opinion anyway that you're rolling into Stryker \u2013 onto the Stryker \u2013 into the Stryker tent. You brought in leadership, which is a plus, obviously strong and complex and it sounds like you printed products and MIS and a variety of other leading edge competitors ends to the market, so great potential set up. I guess, what if anything are you focused on or worried about, or in terms of the integration? What are you most focused on making sure that you maintain here to maximize the impact and minimize the de-synergies? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, so the U.S. sales force integration is the most important part of this integration. That's taking the bulk of our energy prior to the closure of the deal, we in a clean team environment, we actually looked at all the territories, looked at all the overlap, and I can tell you I'm widely impressed with how fast Eric and his leadership team, which is a mixture of Stryker and K2M people, how fast they've moved on making decisions on the regional managers, on making decisions on the territories. And so once people know who their surgeons are and have access to the full bag of products, the quicker you can do that, the quicker you'll make sure that you can grow the business and not have de-synergies. As you know that's been the challenge of the spine deals in the past. I would say they're ahead of where I thought there would be at this stage, but that's what we\u2019re going to watch most closely as U.S. sales force integration, and making sure that we don't lose sales reps or that we don't lose that surgeon relationship. The good news is we didn't have a lot of overlap. That's one of the things \u2013 we modeled the certain amount of overlap and we went in with a clean team to look at the actual overlap it was less than what we had modeled. And so I think the risk is lower for us than what you've seen in previous spine deals, but that is the biggest single risk with this integration. And each quarter we'll give you an update on how that's going. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon, guys. Jumping on Roger's question, if we drill down into the emerging markets, what product lines are you seeing the most growth in? And do you see that product line growth across all of your emerging markets? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, it's really well-balanced. So there is not one single product category that stands out. We've always had a pretty strong Endoscopy division in the emerging markets and that continues to be the case. But I would say, picking up our implant business. That's an area that we've been particularly soft in the past. We're starting to really pick that up in the emerging markets. But it's really kind of across the board. Given our small presence, we have a long way to go to really across our businesses to grow. But it isn't just in one area. What I'm most excited about is, if we get the implant business really rolling that provides the stability and the scale to then be able to deal with the capital fluctuations that invariably occur in these markets. In the past, we've been a little bit overweight in the capital equipment area and that's the part that we're really focused on and I'm feeling very encouraged about our progress. Pito Chickering : All right. Fantastic. And then a quick boring tax question for you. You guided tax rate of 16% and 17%, versus 16.7% for the full year of 2018. Did you face any impacts from recently proposed IRS relation that closed the hybrid tax loophole? Does that impact you guys either in 2019 or in 2020? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Right now, we are not estimating an impact and we really are pretty much sticking with the tax guidance that we developed at the beginning of this year. And we have been monitoring the regs as they've been coming out. So as you can imagine, it's a moving target as they continue to issue more guidance around some of the more complex parts of the new tax laws. But right now, we don't see an impact from that. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. You may proceed. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Katherine, Mako obviously had a very strong quarter, but the magnitude of the beat in that other Ortho line seemed a bit outsized relative to the step up in robot placements. You were up may be 15, 17 systems from 2Q and 3Q, but revenue for that segment jumped by almost $50 million. Was there something else in there that contributed to that upside? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Maybe, I'll take this one. The real primary impact of that sales line, I mean, obviously, relates to the robust installs of our Mako robot, but there were also impacts related to the mix of sales that\u2019s in that line. So we saw a higher percentage of kind of recognizable capital revenue that hit that line. And that was combined with positive price, increased maintenance and also sort of lesser erosion from bone cement. And all that kind of added up to what you're seeing there. Chris Pasquale : That's helpful. Thanks. And then, one detail one for Glenn. Could you just go back to your comment about the expected impact of currency on earnings this year? $0.00 to $0.10 seems like a pretty wide range and I would've thought that the bulk of the impact would fall on 1Q. So can you just walk through your thinking there? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. It's early in the year and it's obviously something that's very variable depending on our own operations and also what happens to currency. Right now, we're seeing probably the greatest impact of that $0.00 to $0.10 forecasted to hit Q1. And then, we expect it to be pretty moderate for the rest of the year. And so that's kind of where our guidance is right now, based on what we can see. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on Mako, one on M&A. Katherine, at the beginning of I think 2018, you said Mako units would grow year-over-year. After strong 2018 it was about 158 robots. Do you still think units can grow, placements can grow year-over-year in 2019? And can you remind us of how common volume-based contracts are for you guys versus pure outright sales of the robot? I have one follow up. Katherine Owen : Yeah. So the majority are pure outright sales of the robot and we absolutely expect to have a double-digit growth in robots installed this year. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. And then, on M&A, Kevin or Katherine, I can't remember a year where Stryker didn\u2019t do a few acquisitions. Could you just give us a snapshot of how you're thinking about M&A in 2019? And how much flexibility you would have on the 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2019? In other words, would you be willing to sacrifice that? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Well, as you know the nature of M&A is inherently unpredictable. It is our number one source and planned to use of cash. That's not change. In six years, I would expect us to continue to be acquisitive. As it relates to dilution, once we see an asset that we think will be really value creating for Stryker, we're going to want to do that deal. And then we'll look at the related dilution and figure out whether we can offset it or not. As you've seen we are very committed to operating margin expansion. We've been able to offset NOVADAQ, Entellus, K2M deal after detail that are high-growth deals that have dilution, we've been able to offset. In the hypothetical sense, if we saw one that was really a fantastic asset and it caused us to be lower in the range, well then we would then communicate that. I wouldn\u2019t say it will be off the table, but that doesn't take away from the efforts we're going to make to continue to drive margin in our core underlying business. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Kevin, a question on Trauma and Extremities. Results were better fourth quarter than we saw in third quarter. So on Trauma, in the U.S. you had supply issues in the third quarter. Have those been resolved? And what was the performance of U.S. Trauma in the fourth quarter? And then my follow-up, my second question is on Extremities. Looks like that did not post in the U.S. double digits. On past calls you've talked about just the law of big numbers. So if you can provide a little bit more color on U.S. Extremities growth? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So our U.S. Trauma and Extremities grew 7% and keep in mind that we had a double-digit growth comparable in the prior year. So, I would tell you that the supply problems are largely behind us. The issues that occurred in the third quarter are not completely resolved but largely behind us. And that really helped us be able to get back to the kind of growth we were more accustomed to in Trauma and Extremities. Our shoulder business really picked up quite nicely. It's the foot and ankle area that had been growing in the 30% range for the first few years when we really built out that business. That's starting to come down to earth a little bit more in line with the market. But I would tell you that Extremities still continues to be one of the most attractive areas within orthopedics and we plan to launch a short-stem shoulder in 2019 and that will continue to drive momentum in an already good performing shoulder business, keeping in mind that we still have relatively low market share in shoulder but very pleased with the performance overall with Trauma and Extremities and expect another strong year in 2019. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. You may proceed. Larry Keusch : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to circle back on emerging markets. Kevin, you said 6% of sales. Given the investment that you guys have been making over the last several years, what do you think is recent place for you to take that business as a percentage of your revenue sales? So said in another way, what gets you happy when you believe you've got an enough scale there? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so the average in med tech is roughly 12%. And you some companies like Becton Dickinson that's higher than 12% given the product portfolio they have in companies like us that are below that average. The challenge that we have is we continue to acquire companies that are largely U.S. based whether it's a K2M, whether it's an Invuity, whether it's an Entellus. A lot of them, the great new technology companies, the NOVADAQ, they tend to be in the United States. And so then that over weights our U.S. business. I would expect the emerging markets to continue to be, let's call it, strong double-digit growers every single year. And so, as long as it does that over time, it'll tick on a higher percentage of our business as long as those acquisitions also start to grow in the emerging markets. So getting to the double digits would be great, but the reality is, as long as we're growing in strong double digits and those businesses are gaining scale and size, that's really more important to me than a magical number that we get to by having the U.S. lower its growth. And we're growing close to 8% in the U.S. I don't want that to slow down. That's one way emerging markets percentage can rise as if we slow down in the U.S. and that's obviously not in our plans. But if we continue to have robust double-digit growth in emerging markets, overtime that 6% will move up and it should be for a company like ours more like in the 10% plus range over time. Larry Keusch : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s clear. And then just as a follow up, you obviously mentioned in your beds and stretchers business nice performance in the quarter and you made the comment that that was really without any new product introductions. So I guess the question is, what do you have coming there in 2019? And do you think that we might be at the beginning point of a replacement cycle? As I understand, I think the last replacement cycle certainly MedSurg was in the 2004, 2005 timeframe. Kevin Lobo : Look, the replacement cycle is continuous, so there isn't sort of one massive replacement cycle. You have hospitals buying other hospitals that are wanting to standardize on their equipment. We bring a lot of technology. So when we say no meaningful new products, we mean an entire new frame and with all the features. We're constantly updating software. We have new surfaces that we launched. So there is always some form of innovation. There wasn't any major platform launch. We're not going to really get into the timing of those launches, those are things we prefer to wait until those products are actually launched. But suffice to say that we have a really good pipeline within our Medical business, both for the beds, the stretchers as well as the emergency cost. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Isaac Ro : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So just want to ask another one on Mako, just putting together some of the commentary here on the call. You referenced that still over 40% of replacements are coming from competitive accounts and that, if I look at the numbers, that mix is down a little bit sequentially, but obviously still pretty strong. And at the same time, you're talking about opportunities to place additional instruments in existing accounts that have Mako already. So if I put all that together, I'm curious how you think the mix of competitive placement will play out over the next 12, 24 months, given the competition there probably gets a little bit thicker? Katherine Owen : Yeah. I think we're going to have to wait and see. We've been running pretty consistently north of 40% in competitive accounts. It did jump to over 50% last quarter. But if you look back, as we've reported that number each quarter, it's typically hovered between 40% and 50%. I think we'll just going to have to wait and see how it plays out with comparative launches. We haven't been through this before. We feel really comfortable though given the number of hospitals available to us, the clinical data we have, the unique features of our robot that we're going to have the ability to continue to install new robots. What the mix ends up looking like, will probably move around, but clearly competitive accounts are going to be part of it. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. And I think the additional competition in the market is not necessarily a bad thing. If you believe you have a proven system that really delivers terrific value, we would welcome a head-to-head comparison. In some accounts that maybe haven't been opened to having that discussion. So, I think that the entry of other products in the market actually will grow robotics. And robotics as you saw in -- if you want to AAOS the last two years, it's dramatically changed. The whole dialogue about robotics is everywhere. They are here to stay. And I think more interest in robotics will frankly provide a tailwind in the market and a tailwind for our Mako business. Isaac Ro : Great. And Kevin just maybe a follow-up on the earlier comment you made about the source of the upside and the other component of Orthopaedics. Could you just maybe breakdown again a little bit more clearly the biggest reason why that looked little stronger? If I read your right, the biggest piece was the capital equipment kind of revenue piece was stronger. And the reason I ask is I'm curious if that's a trend that you expect to continue this year that basically the mix of revenue you're getting in that business is on a trajectory that look sustainable? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, Isaac, this is Glenn. If you look at Q4, first of all that is seasonably by far and away the most robust capital cycle selling that we see. And so what we really saw in the Mako \u2013 in that line item, which is primarily made up of Mako and bone cement was a couple of things, obviously, really robust installs, 54 in the quarter, which was significantly higher than prior year quarter. And then also just in terms of the nature of whether or not they were rentals, whether or not there were lease through, we just saw higher rate of the recognizable capital revenues sales then we've seen in prior quarter. And then that really combined with just positive price. We're also starting to see revenue come off of maintenance contracts as we get hit sort of a critical mass that's out in the field. And then lastly just less erosion from bone cement, which really combined to produce the robust numbers that you're seeing there. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Very nice quarter and thank you for taking the question. Two questions really, what happens when you get into these competitive accounts with Mako? How sticky once you are there, utilization of all the other products that Stryker has? Katherine Owen : It\u2019s pretty sticky, Joanne. We grow by multiple factors faster in the accounts that have a Mako system, because well first of all the system is close. But then the sales force has the opportunity to go in and sell the entire portfolio, and benefiting from a new hip they can go in and sell, plus our various 3D printed products around the knee systems. So it absolutely has that Halo effect once we get the robot in there. So it's not just selling Triathlon. We see significantly faster growth across our portfolio, recon products in those Mako accounts. Joanne Wuensch : And with AAOS coming up, can you give us a highlight of what we should be expecting there? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yeah. We'll have the opportunity to meet with the senior management team as we customarily do also do a booth tour. We\u2019re still financing, but we anticipate having clearly Mako, so Robert Cohen will be there to answer questions on the robot. Eric as I mentioned will be there to talk about the K2M integration and some of the product portfolio. We will also have our new 1688 camera at the booth and so that will be part of the tour as well as some Trauma products. And I believe that info was out on the website for folks who want to sign up on the booth tour or attend any of the investor meetings with the senior management team. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed. Craig Bijou : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on guidance. It's a little wider than 2018 for both organic growth and EPS. Obviously, FX, the uncertainty around FX impacts the EPS range. But just wanted to see if there's any reason for the wider guidance perhaps macro concerns? And then, maybe just a bigger picture, what are your thoughts on how the macro environment can impact you guys in 2019? Katherine Owen : Yeah. We feel really good about the overall macro environment as it currently stands, as Kevin referenced in his comments. And we also feel good about the momentum we have exiting 2018 across the businesses. Just keep in mind, we're a much bigger company and so there's a larger revenue base. We're in more markets. We've done acquisition, so there's just more variables overall. Typical we had a basis point range similar to this year. So overall, I think with the highs guidance in a decade, recognizing that things change and we're a big diverse business, I think it's an appropriate range to start the year at. Craig Bijou : Great. That's helpful. And just one follow-up on pricing. Glenn, I appreciate your comments and the expectation for 2019. It is a little bit lower, if you look at the midpoint compared to what you guys had in for the full year 2018. And then, even if you look at Orthopaedics, sequentially pricing decreased significantly in Q4 from Q3. So just thoughts there. I mean is the environment getting better from a pricing perspective? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I think, if we think about price, both the performance this year and what we're guiding to next year. I mean a couple of things. I think it's less bad than it used to be a year ago. But I also think that if you just sort of look at the mix of where we expect growth to come from, obviously MedSurg will be a big grower next year for us and there are less susceptible to price. And the same holds true for some of our international sales. So I think given that mix, we probably will see sort of a similar pricing environment, maybe even a little better in 2019. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed. Josh Jennings : Hi. Good evening. Thanks. I was hoping to start off going back to the operating margin performance in 2018. It sounds like you're able to absorb 50 basis points of acquisition headwinds and with a 40 basis point performance you really out-achieved the core business, out-achieved or outperformed the top end of the range. And maybe just help us understand what's going better? And you laid out the CTG program, I think, in November 2017 and you're having stronger-than-expected expansion in the core business? And how much of that outperformance is volume driven, just tagged on to the stronger revenue growth that you've experienced and that you've generated? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I think, as you think about that performance and certainly covering the impact of acquisitions, there's a lot of puts and takes that flow through margin. A couple of things I will say is, first of all, there's a really disciplined leverage approach that's done by all of our businesses as they think about over-performing their targets and how much they need to drop through, so much so that it's a part of everyone's incentive plan here at Stryker. The second thing I would point to is that, these near-term CTG programs, like indirect spend and shared services, we're really starting to see some of the benefits come through from those programs and those benefits are obviously reflecting in the amount of drop-through that we can have. On the flipside of that, given the amount of acquisitions that we had during the year, those were very dilutive to the op margin. And we push the integration efforts of those as quick as we can, especially sort of on the G&A side of things so that we can sort of squeeze better out margin performance even out of acquisitions. Kevin Lobo : I would tell you that there's been a noticeable change in the speed of our integration versus even three or four years ago. And, obviously, you know the dilution because these are public traded companies; you can see how negative they are. Speed of getting those synergies has increased dramatically and K2M is a good example where, obviously, it will be pretty heavily dilutive in the first half of the year and that dilution will start to abate as we drive out those synergies. But speed of integration is a new mantra at Stryker and that's really taking hold over the last two years. Josh Jennings : Great, thanks. And maybe just in front of AAOS, I think some of the debate is going to be new competitive robot for the total knee application coming to market, maybe launched at AAOS versus Mako and maybe some of the different features, competitive features that you're going to defend against. And I guess some of the things we\u2019re going to understand as a lack of need for CT scan, may be some faster registration and allowing the surgeon to actually do the cutting with their own saw versus the robot making the cuts. Any initial points from a competitive -- defensive standpoint for Mako versus the ROSA robot? Thanks for taking the questions. Katherine Owen : Yeah, we're going to continue to stay focused on the strategy around our robot and executing on the features and benefits that we've talked about the ability to balance and the clinical data that\u2019s continuing to support the outcomes. I think it's valuable that we've got a number of data points that we routinely report on the quarter whether its placement, utilization rates, surgeon trained, clinical data that should make it easier to compared those same data points with competitive offering. So I think it validates that robotics is absolutely here to stay in Orthopaedics and it's impacting the market. So we're not surprised we're seeing competitive responses, but we're also in no way changing our strategy because its clearly been successful and we think it's the one to stick with as we think about this year and beyond. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. You may proceed. Kristen Stewart : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my call. Good to see that the floor is still fully intact from an earnings perspective. Wanted to just clarify just on the Sage commentary you said, I think you said mid-single digit growth. Was that for the fourth quarter? I assume that's not for the full year? Glenn Boehnlein : No, that was the full year, Kristen it picked up in the fourth quarter, yeah, so fourth quarter was double digit; full year was mid-single-digit. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. And then how should we just think about that business going forward? Obviously, you expect for it to continue to get better from what I'm understanding. So will that evolve back into, I think it was high single or double-digit growth profile that you had expected at the time of the acquisition? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, it's great business. The pipeline continues to be really solid. I would expect 2019 to be a better year than 2018. We exited the fourth quarter with a ton of momentum. We have a couple of really interesting new products that we'll be launching in 2019. So, that business should continue to be high-single-digit, low double-digit growth for the foreseeable future. Obviously the remediation efforts were very severe, very significant. And a couple of the product categories that took us a little longer to get back the business that we had lost during that interruption. But there're now starting to hit their stride and I would expect that to be reliable and solid contributor to our growth. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed. Will Inglis : Hi, thanks for the questions. This is Will on for Matt. I guess, my first question would be, if you drill in the ischemic stroke bucket of neurovascular, wondering what you've seen in terms of the expiration system in terms of utilization as a standalone or if it's being used in combination with retrievers? And when that's in full launch some time -- correct me, if I'm wrong, but sometime in the next couple of months, wondering what impact it will have for the broader ischemic portfolio with regards to pull through and broader hospital contracting? Katherine Owen : Yes. So we're in the very early stages of the launch, but it is absolutely one of the factors that we think is going to contribute to strong neurovascular growth this year. Most of the times it's using conjunction with a stentriever because that's really what the clinical data has demonstrated in terms of having the most impact. But you do have those surgeons who prefer to go with Aspiration only as the first path. Typically, 40% to 60% of the time you have to go back in with a retriever, but we wanted to be able to have an offering for those surgeons who are not currently using a stentriever first. So, it will be a mix of the two, but it's too early to tell you with any specificity how much -- or what the waiting is between the two. Will Inglis : Okay, great. Thank you. And then with the combined spine portfolio now placing kind of in the top three, four, five providers. Wondering if you can give us any advice with regards to your enabling technologies strategy in the near-term? Katherine Owen : It's still very early. I think the key here right now is with K2M we get an immediate product refresh, we get a strong foothold in the deformity market that has a big impact with the thought leaders in this market. We have a much more expanded offering across the Board and a larger sales force and we also have an expanded 3D-printed offering. And then longer term as we've talked about previously, I think this position us well in the out-years and we bring the spine robot to market, but that's still years off. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I would tell you that Eric and the leadership team are evaluating our pre-planning in our navigation. They had their own preplanning system as well as looking at Robotics. And given that the focus in the short-term has been getting the organization sorted, getting the early synergies, having the sales force really mapped, that has been job one. I would tell you in the future quarters, we'll have a better idea on the enabling technologies, but right now, the main focus has been getting the sales force really organized for success. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Just back on the Ortho outperformance in the Q, did you guys see anything from a competitive perspective, was there any disruption? I think you mentioned bone cement as being in that other bucket as a driver, there was some disruption on the competitive front? And any comments on what drove that outperformance, not just in the other bucket, but even in the knees and the hips? And when you think about the new products like 3D-printed cups coming in for next year, sort of can you put that all -- fold it all in and what it means for 2019? Katherine Owen : So it's one of the factors behind the revenue guide of 6.5% to 7.5%. Clearly, we're selling to see the impact of our new 3D-printed hip cup. We've had hundreds of surgeons now exposed to it including competitive surgeons. I think that's a really strong offering. Knees is clearly the MAKO affect overall. Bone cement, Glenn's comment more about the fact that the decline was less significant, although, we're still seeing some pressure in our bone cement as we continue to ramp-up; we're now well over 30% of our knees are cement-less. And I think overall that the bulk of it, the market feels relatively similar from a competitive standpoint as it is in the third quarter. I think most of what we're seeing is share gain related. Vijay Kumar : That's very helpful. And then maybe was just one more on margins here. A large concerns on the margins and this guide is really strong. I'm just curious on M&A dilution. Can you give us a sense on how much of headwind is to margins that you guys are eating? I mean, it looks like the underlying is coming in really strong? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. When you look at sort of M&A across-the-board and you really need to focus on some of the bigger ones especially liked K2. At the gross margin line is actually favorable impact that we'll see. But then when you move on down the selling and the accelerating that we're doing relative to ramping sales almost all of them become dilutive in SG&A, so that's \u2013 this year, for the year and the quarter, we saw 50 basis points of headwind. I'm expecting that that headwind will continue at least through the first couple of quarters of 2019. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. You may proceed. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask you about your order book, you talk more about it this quarter and I think I've ever heard you talk about it in the past. And I was wondering, if you could quantify or give us some more color on how that's improved sequentially or over time? And what are the main areas of strength outside of Mako? Katherine Owen : It's really across the board with our capital facing businesses. We're, obviously, gearing up for the launch at the end of the first quarter of the 1688 camera. We're excited about that. Mako, candidly we had a really strong quarter but we also didn't want to convey the people that somehow it's a pull-through order that we had anticipated in the first quarter it was not. And so it's just across-the-board. Medical is having a really strong growth and we usually have a pretty good visibility into their order book going out a few quarters. So there is no one thing we would highlight. It's just across the board feels pretty healthy going into the year. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, even instruments had a very strong order book. In instruments if you notice double-digit growth on top of comparative year double-digit growth, and a strong order book. And part of the reason we\u2019re sharing a little bit more on the order book is we're starting off with a very significant guide, a really strong organic growth guide and to let you know that we have the confidence behind that guide is a strong order book really across the board. So entering the year with very good momentum. Matt Taylor : Great. That make sense. And I just wanted to really slightly on the spine, but I'm curious as you develop your expertise and your clinical data around Mako, you're gathering a lot of robotics nuggets here as we go along. Do you think that there are other areas that you can bring that expertise to even outside of car tissue? Or can you talk about the relative importance of using robotics in the knee procedure versus spine versus Extremities? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so for right now we've been very clear that our focus is hard tissue robotics starting with, obviously, hips and knees. We certainly have the opportunity with shoulder and spine and we have teams that are working on that. It's early stages and certainly too premature for us to talk about potential launch dates and what that\u2019s going to look like. But that's our focus. We're not really looking at soft tissue robotics right now. It's really a hard tissue robotic focus. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed. Kyle Rose : Great, thank you very much for taking the questions. And I reiterate that the sentiments on a strong Q4. Kevin, I just want to talk quickly from a high level on the portfolio, if I think about some of the recent acquisitions both NOVADAQ last \u2013 in 2017 and Invuity in 2018 both, obvious to bring differentiated technologies to leverage across the core business. But they both overlap in an area where Stryker has historically not competed and that being women's health and breast recon. So just maybe in a larger sense, I mean, how do you view the portfolio strategy and division here as far as the direction that these assets position for the portfolio? Kevin Lobo : So I'll start with Invuity and so within Instruments, it's a pretty broad portfolio of products. And what Invuity did would helped us to catalyze split of that sales force. So that surgical unit within Instruments has the power tools, it has the gown that covers the surgeon. It also has Neptune waste management, surg account and frankly hard to focus on all of those different call points. And so in Invuity fits beautifully with Neptune waste management as well as the surg account procedures in that call point. So we've created a new specialized sales force called surgical technologies. And then orthopedic Instruments that includes all the power tools as well as the Steri-Shield products and that are really sold in the Ortho area. So if anything it helped us drive extra focus and enable us to specialize our sales force and that's been to be a catalyst for Instruments continue what you've seen as a kind of amazing performance over the last decade of very, very high single or low double-digit growth year after year after year. So it's really not something that's a new call point. It actually strengthens a basket of products that we've either invented or acquired in recent history. As to whether, we'll get into other areas, that's just something Stryker continually looks at. And if we believe that our sales force can bring new technologies to call points we'll do that. But our biggest asset of Stryker is that our sales force since. We know how to run a great offense and if we can bring them new technologies and continue to specialize the sale forces, we're going to continue to drive high growth. Kyle Rose : Great. And then just a follow-up on the hip side. I mean, I know you talked about the new 3D-printed cup, but when you talked about Mako you talked about 50% of the U.S. procedures still being TKA. I guess I'm just trying to understand how much of an opportunity is there to really see a Mako affect on the hip side? And then when you're seeing your competitive accounts that you're bringing over with Mako are you seeing them trial in the 3D in the hip portfolio? Are they really staying more centralized to the knee side? Katherine Owen : No. We absolutely see them trailing, especially it's a great opportunity given the launch of the new Trident II cup out there. So we always knew or believed that the biggest driver of the Mako adoption was going to be around the total knee given the unmet need and patient dissatisfaction rates. But we continue to see increases on the hip side as well and that's part the benefit of once you get into account and you can sell the totality of the offering and the surgeons start to see some of the benefits. So I think knees given the 60% of the procedures will still dominate, but absolutely we'll see an impact from hip. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter as well. So just one question for me, you know the European MDR regulation kicks-in in 2020 making 2019 more of a transition year. Now the surface \u2013 it appears quite onerous. I'm just wondering, if we should be thinking about any incremental costs potentially from this regulation that's coming place in Europe, or do you intend to remove any SKUs out of the European markets that maybe don't make sense? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, Ryan. We've actually been working on the registration process related to the new regulation over the course of the past year. And early on in the year according with our \u2013 in accordance with our \u2013 sort of our non-GAAP policy, we received approval to remove those costs from our regular earnings and move them to non-GAAP. So in terms of the guidance you're getting and the numbers you're seeing, you're really seeing the excess costs, the extra cost remove. Now, you're correct any going forward burden that we might have related to the regulations would flow through a regular R&D line item as we up our standards relative to that regulation. Ryan Zimmerman : Got it. Thanks for the info, Kevin. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Well, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2019 results will be held on April 23rd. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. And thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Sue Dooley, Vocera's Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sue Dooley : Hello everyone. Welcome to Vocera's conference call to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings. This is Sue Dooley and joining me today are Vocera's CEO, Brent Lang and Justin Spencer, our CFO. We distributed a press release detailing our quarterly results earlier this afternoon. The release is posted to our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the Investor Relations page of our website where a replay will be archived. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties described in our filings with the SEC and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On this call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks Sue. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2019 was an extremely busy quarter for Vocera and provided a strong and strategic start to the year. First quarter revenue was $35 million and we beat our goals for both revenue and profitability. There are five key accomplishments from the quarter that I will highlight of the call today. First, we achieved strong bookings including our largest non-healthcare booking in the history of the company. We also won some large expansion deals and had healthy supplies and maintenance renewals in the quarter. Second, our performance in the fed was excellent, refreshing our confidence after Q4 and setting us up well for the year ahead. We reached a major milestone in our federal business with the award of an authority to operate with the Navy and Air Force. Third, we had a successful launch of the new Vocera Smartbadge and we believe we are right where we wanted to be after the first few months of this major product introduction. Customer feedback has been very positive. Fourth, we had another successful quarter of customer go-live installations. I am proud of our team. Our professional services expertise remains a meaningful differentiator in helping our customers achieve real improvement in their communications and workflow challenges. Finally, we had our best ever HIMSS conference with great booth traffic, a record number of leads and a successful investor breakfast. Let me go into more detail on each of these areas before discussing what we are seeing in the market and giving Justin an opportunity to cover our financial results. From a bookings perspective, the highlight of the quarter was a large multimillion dollar win at Nordstrom, one of the world's largest premium retailers which will use our solution to connect employees in the majority of their full-line stores around the U.S. It was a watershed accomplishment for our non-healthcare group and illustrates the opportunity that we see outside of healthcare as well as the diverse sources of growth that support our company. Beginning this quarter, Nordstrom will outfit their teams with our unique wearable communication badge and leverage our full software platform to create several integrations and workflows. The goal is to enable sales associates and customers to experience luxury retail with an enhanced technology layer of service and efficiency. We are delighted to help Nordstrom deliver exceptional service to their customers as they innovate around the retail experience. We also won another Four Seasons property, a meaningful honor from an outstanding brand. In healthcare, our business with existing customers was healthy this quarter with several important expansion orders. Notably, we had a $1.3 million booking at Reading Hospital, a sizable batch refresh from Banner Health and an expansion deal at NYU Langone for Winthrop University Hospital, where they are rolling our Engage. In another significant development for the quarter, we received an authority to operate, known as ATO, from the U.S. Department of Defense. This DoD certification based on compliance with strict security requirements and risk assessment is a required part of authorizing, securing and managing healthcare technology systems across the DoD. You may recall, we already had an ATO for the Army, which helped drive our MEDCOM wins in prior years. This expanded ATO applies to all branches of the U.S. military worldwide for the purchase of our hands-free Vocera Badge. Combined with our previously announced SATOC contracting vehicle, we now have the fundamental building blocks that allow us to sell and deploy our voice solution healthcare facilities in the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy. With the authority to operate in hand, our federal team kicked off 2019 strong by bringing in some great wins including a deal at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, our first Air Force facility. We also secured bookings from the Ann Arbor VA, the Phoenix VA and the Robert Dole VA medical facility in Wichita. It was a great Q1 in the fed and our team is preparing for an exciting year ahead. As most of you know, the biggest activity for Vocera in Q1 was the launch of the new Vocera Smartbadge. Based on our experience in the market so far, we are confident that the product introduction is proceeding according to our expectations. We shipped our first pilot units during Q1 and many customers are evaluating the new Smartbadge. Early indications are validating our view that this new and unique product furthers our competitive lead, showcases more of the functionality of our solution and has the potential to accelerate our software revenues in the long run. We have only shipped a small number of Smartbadges as it's still very early in this product introduction cycle. However, we are really encouraged by the sizable pipeline we have built to-date. I am particularly pleased that early feedback on the Smartbadge has been positive in terms of its pricing, size and weight. And we are seeing a lot of excitement around putting some of our software to work in a hands-free environment. As an aside, April is Workforce Violence Awareness Month. You will remember from our past commentary that the panic call feature on our hands-free device is a widely popular safety feature. I believe the Smartbadge, with its dedicated panic button, takes this concept a step further to effectively ensure the safety of mobile workers. During Q1, we had another very successful quarter of customer go-lives. Deployments of our solution continue on schedule. One notable deployment in Q1 was at Sutter CPMC Van Ness in San Francisco. You will remember, we went live last fall with Sutter CPMC Mission Bernal. So this is our second full solution Sutter deployment in just a few months. This brand-new showcase facility on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco is leveraging our full solution across 3,000 users, including many different operating departments and units. They are using several integrated clinical workflows and the power of Vocera Analytics to transform their organization. We also went house-wide at CHRISTUS Health in Texas as they prepare to move to a new tower which will be the largest ER and trauma center in South Texas. We replaced in-building wireless phones at Mount Sinai St. Luke's in New York and we expanded our footprint at UNC Nash General replacing a paper process with Vocera Rounds. Finally, we had a nice deployment of our Engage solution at Masonic Villages long-term care facility in Pennsylvania. The other big Q1 event was HIMSS and I would like take a moment to recap our experience at the conference. HIMSS is always a critical lead generation and customer event for us and this year that momentum continued. We had a big presence this year and our booth was constantly busy with customers and integration partners eager to see the Smartbadge and hear about our solutions. While HIMSS attendance was reported as down, our booth traffic was up about 30% and we grew qualified leads at a similar rate. We conducted a record number of customer meetings and built substantial pipeline for our sales team. We were pleased to see many of you at our investor events where our CNO, Rhonda Collins, led a fireside chat with Mary Beth Mitchell of Texas Health Resources. They discussed the importance of leveraging IT systems in clinical work as well as the long-term strategic nature of our expanding relationship. A recording of this event is available on our Investor Relations website for anyone who hasn't heard it. Overall, Vocera commanded a strong presence at HIMSS sending the message loud and clear that we are the leading player in the healthcare communication and collaboration space. With Q1 solidly behind us, we have a lot to look forward to in Q2 and beyond. In the healthcare market, spending always requires rigorous prioritization. My interactions with hospital executives continue to demonstrate that improving margins and quality of care consistently rise to the top of their priority list. Hospitals need to reduce costs and improve throughput by eliminating friction and bottlenecks and streamlining operations. These investment priorities remain top of mind and they play right into our strengths. Another trend I continue to see is larger deal sizes. With this, the decision-making is becoming more centralized, adding layers of the approval process and requiring more enterprise sales acumen. While this can be challenging, it also can work to our favor. The marketplace is demanding a unified platform that has a demonstrated capability to support the patient journey across the health system. Our complete platform combined with our large customer footprint and our unparalleled experience in implementing communication solutions has become a meaningful differentiator for us. And from my seat, while the competitive environment is always crucial to monitor, I believe our differentiated leadership position continues to grow. One topic that is gaining a lot of attention in the market right now is cognitive overload for nurses. Over 250,000 people die each year from medical errors in the U.S. and several recent studies have pursued this topic further. In one study, distraction has been shown to play a role in the majority of medical errors. Another study cites cognitive overload as a cause in 80% of medical device user errors. The cost of nurse turnover amounts to millions of dollars per year and the American Nurses Association reports that three out of four nurses describe the effects of stress and overwork as a top health concern. We have known these factors to be a significant problem in healthcare for some time and they are core to our mission to help organizations achieve the quadruple aim. Vocera technology helps reduce cognitive overload for clinicians by attaching information about a patient to the communication thread so it's easy to access. It helps deflect distractions to allow focus on critical tasks. Our solutions offload the need to retrieve, retain and record information allowing nuisance notifications to be filtered out and making it easier to communicate and stay focused. It's an exciting time for Vocera as we strive to grow the business and accelerate towards our profitability goals. I am gratified by our continued progress in Q1 and our enhanced position in the market. While we still need to execute well as we progress with the Smartbadge introduction, we feel momentum in the businesses building with strategic customer bookings, successful large-scale deployments and high customer loyalty. Now I would like to give our CFO, Justin, a chance to cover the financial details around our Q1 results and our guidance for Q2. Justin? Justin Spencer : Thanks Brent. Hello everyone. Overall, we had a solid start to our year. Our first-quarter revenue came in as expected and we beat our profitability goals. Importantly, Q1 set us up for a return to revenue growth and improve profitability in Q2. Total revenue in Q1 was $35.3 million, compared to $40.2 million in the same period last year. Since the details of our revenue comparisons are in our earnings release, I will focus my commentary on the context for these metrics and how we think about growth going forward. Q1 revenue played out just as we expected, reflecting the impact of our backlog position entering the period as well as the effect of some customers slowing their expansions for badge refresh purchases temporarily while they evaluate the new Smartbadge. These dynamics impacted both our device and software revenue streams in the quarter and were entirely expected. We are really encouraged by the initial feedback from customers about the Smartbadge and expect several of them to begin making larger volume purchases of the new product over the next several months. And we have a rapidly growing pipeline that we think will fuel healthy growth of the Smartbadge and associated software revenue over the next several quarters. As further context on our software revenue, it is worth noting that we face a difficult comparison in Q1 last year as more of our business has transitioned to larger deals, which is a very positive trend for our business. We have experienced software revenue lumpiness on a few occasions. For example, in Q1 last year we shipped over $2 million of software to a single customer representing roughly 25% of that quarter's software revenue. As a result, we encourage investors to evaluate our software revenue performance over a period of several quarters. We had a healthy software backlog exiting Q1 and we expect software revenue to grow in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our revenue pattern for software maintenance and support revenue is predictable because it is recurring and is recognized over an extended period of time. As a result of large software revenue growth over the last several quarters, our software maintenance and support revenue grew 17% in Q1 compared to last year. Also fueling this was our high customer renewal rate, which continued to be in excess of 95%, well above industry standard and reflect the benefits our customers experience from using our solution. Professional services was down slightly compared to last year as a result of our continued efforts to streamline our implementation process. This enables us to be even more competitive with the delivery of these deployment related services and shift more of the revenue to our software. However we have a healthy backlog of professional services that should fuel growth in this part of our business in 2019. Lastly and as expected our combined backlog and deferred revenue increased to roughly $119 million in Q1, up from $109 million in the first quarter last year. Compared to Q4, this combined balance decreased only slightly, which is much better than we have seen during Q1 in prior years. We continue to encourage investors to evaluate backlog and deferred revenue on a combined basis as well as on a year-over-year basis. On the profitability side, our adjusted EBITDA loss was $3.5 million, better than we expected as we continue to optimize our spending for growth and scalability. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $11.7 million. Now let me get into some more detail on our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin Q1 was 60%, right where we expected and followed our typical seasonal pattern for the first quarter. Product margin decreased compared to last year as a result of the lower device and software revenue. Services margin improved year-over-year as a result of the higher mix of software maintenance and support revenue. Q1 has traditionally been our lowest gross margin quarter, so we expect it to improve in Q2 on higher revenue and a more favorable revenue mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $25.8 million were flat sequentially and up roughly 6% compared to last year. The investments we have made over the last few years to enhance our scalability have enabled us to keep our operating expense growth quite modest overall, while continuing to invest meaningfully in the areas that we believe will drive long-term growth. As a result, we continue to believe that there is more opportunity to drive operating leverage as we grow. To cap off my Q1 commentary, we again added to our cash balance ending at just over $222 million. With our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities. Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We are off to a solid start to the year and expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth and improved profitability in Q2. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $41 million and $45 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $500,000 and $3 million. We anticipate our second quarter GAAP net loss to be between $8.9 million and $5.9 million. For the year, we reiterate our previously issued annual guidance. Q1 was an important and encouraging quarter for us on many fronts. We expect higher levels of bookings and revenue in Q2 to help set us up for stronger growth in the second half of 2019. I will now turn it back to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks Justin. In summary, I am pleased with the start that Q1 provides to 2019. I believe our success underscores both our leadership position in this large, growing market and the strategic importance customers are seeing in our products. I want to take this opportunity to formally introduce two new Board members who we announced a couple weeks ago in a press release. As of our Annual Stockholder Meeting on May 31, 2019, we plan to add Julie Iskow and Bharat Sundaram to our Board. These additions are of strategic value to our company because they bring important expertise and insight to our leadership group in the areas of cloud-based software, data analytics and AI as well as tremendous knowledge of the healthcare industry. Julie is the Chief Technology Officer of Medidata Solutions. With a long history of product development and cloud-based solutions, Julie's background will be a tremendous benefit to our solution roadmap and engineering team. Bharat is President of Performance Improvement Services at Vizient and his experience with advanced analytics and healthcare market insights will strengthen our operational perspective and business strategies. I am thrilled to be partnering with these two new Board members and believe they will add tremendous value to the company. These new members of our Board will replace John Grotting and Jeff Hillebrand who are stepping down after many years of service. I want to thank both gentlemen for providing strong leadership and valuable industry perspectives throughout their tenure as Board members. I look forward to collaborating with our entire Board as Vocera delivers healthcare innovation to a broadly underserved market and strives for long-term growth and accelerating profitability. Q1 gave us a strong and strategic start to 2019. With our differentiated solutions and a large market opportunity in front of us, we are excited to build upon this momentum. I am really proud that Vocera is the quadruple aim company. We look forward to making a difference to the hospital bottomline as well as to quality of care and staff resilience as we drive towards enabling the real-time health system. With that, we are ready to conclude our formal remarks. Thank you for listening today. Operator, we are ready to open up the line for questions. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Daniels : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions and I appreciate the commentary that you are getting positive feedback from the new badge. I guess my question is, given that that is still in process and most of the badge sales are in pipeline, I am curious if there is anything you can do from a promotional front to employ to try to drive some sense of urgency to make sure that that pipeline is converted to sales to drive the back half ramp? Brent Lang : Hi Ryan. Thanks for the question. There are a couple of things that we are doing. We did run a promotion in Q1 that gave people a bit of a discount on the purchase of their first five sample units. So they were able to get them in in-house and get them qualified. We have also been doing what we think is kind of a white-glow install treatment where we are really bear-hugging the customers, these initial customers as they are doing the deployment and installation to make sure that we are getting immediate feedback on what they like or anything that needs to be fixed or improved as they move forward. We are helping them with the software upgrade that has to be done in order to be able to use the new badge. So we are definitely putting effort and focus on it. I am really encouraged by size of the pipeline. It's growing faster than I expected and I think we are going to start the meaningful revenue coming from the Smartbadge, particularly in the second half of the year. And this is more just a traditional natural cycle of evolution. I think customers have to take time to evaluate the product. They have to evaluate the mix that they are likely going to see in their particular instance. Which users are going to use the B3000n and which users will use the new Smartbadge. And so that's just a natural evolution process. But we are definitely providing both financial incentives as well as support and services incentive to help them with that transition and evaluation. Ryan Daniels : Okay. Very helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe a little bit more detail, if you could, on the Nordstrom win? I am curious, just a little bit more on background there? Is that something you been actively pursuing? Was that some sort of RFP? Did they come to you to try to better compete with the digital marketplaces of the world? And then any color on the actual number of stores? I know they have about 115 or so across the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. But I am curious how many badges that might be, given this is U.S. full-line only? Thanks. Brent Lang : Yes. We are really excited about it. This is a deal that we have been working on for about 18 months. Actually, first we were reached out by Nordstrom. They initially heard about us from someone who used to work at one of our hospital customers. And when he joined their IT group and was looking at various communications solutions that might be able to be used in the retail environment, they heard about our solution and reached out to us. They actually have done a fair amount of work with us already. They did a pilot in two different stores in the back half of last year. And they have also done some work in one of their warehouses to evaluate these products. So they are very comfortable with the functionality and they got really positive reviews from the people in the stores. And that's what gave them the confidence to go ahead and move forward with this. We are displacing a competitive solution that they had used in the past that was not meeting their expectations. And so they were looking to improve upon that. Your estimate in terms of number of stores is right on. I think it's right in the mid-100 and teens level and the vast majority of those full-line stores will be getting a deployment, not necessarily to all employees initially, but over time we hope to grow that deployment. We are not able to share the exact number of badges or the dollar amount of the deal, but we were thrilled that Nordstrom was willing to allow us to issue a press release to at least dip the name out there and very appreciative of that. But we are somewhat limited in terms of what we can say about the size of the deal in terms of number badges or dollars. Ryan Daniels : Okay. Fair enough. That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sean Wieland : Thanks. So the device revenue is actually a little better than I was expecting. I think you had mentioned, guided us for that number to be about cut in half. And so I wanted to just understand what was that upside? Where did that come from? Was it from better sale of Smartbadges? Or what? Brent Lang : Yes. Hi Sean. The badge business performed relatively well. I think the area that was impacted the most as we had expected was the expansion of refresh. The supplies came in really quite well and we even had some new badge wins including, well, from a revenue standpoint, the Nordstrom deal has not started for revenue but that part of our business was okay as well. The badge business continued to be really healthy. I think we had expected when we launched the Smartbadge that several customers would pause and defer purchases of the original badge for refresh purposes or expansions until they had the opportunity to evaluate the Smartbadge. And that's exactly what has happened. So as we transition now to Q2, we expect some more of those decisions to be made. And so we will likely see our device revenue increase sequentially, both of the original badge as well as the beginnings of the ramp of revenue from the Smartbadge. Sean Wieland : Okay. Brent Lang : And specifically as it relates to Smartbadge revenue in Q1, it was pretty minimal. Most of the shipments of the Smartbadge were just small quantities of evaluation units. So it didn't represent a significant amount of revenue in Q1. Sean Wieland : Okay. And now that clients have had about 90 days to evaluate this, what do you expect the attach rate will be for Engage when one of your clients goes all-in on a Smartbadge? Brent Lang : It's a great question. I don't think we have enough data points at this point to really know. The attach rate of Engage across our installed base is still relatively low. We are still working a lot of cross-sell opportunities and even a couple years into this. While that portion of our business has grown really nicely, we are still at very low penetration rates across the installed base. I think the Smartbadge will help accelerate that but there is more to embracing Engage than just the Smartbadge. I think in many cases, it represents really a fundamental shift in how workflows are created inside the hospital. And so that takes time as they define those processes and create policies around them. But I don't see a reason why over the long-term the majority of our hospital customers wouldn't go ahead and leverage that capability. So I think the attach rate over time is going to be quite high, but I don't think it's going to be necessarily upfront and I don't think it's going to be necessarily with the initial purchase. Sean Wieland : Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one. What's the year-over-year compare on the backlog plus deferred revenue? What was it? Justin Spencer : Year-over-year, yes, it's up 9% total. Sean Wieland : Got it. Thanks so much. Brent Lang : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Dodge with Jeffries. Your line is open. Sean Dodge : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. Maybe going back to Ryan's question on kind of the evaluation process of the new badge. I think you had initially said, we would get some test size order quantities. People would take maybe a month, two months to evaluate that and that should be followed by some orders. So the evaluation process to order time taking a maybe a quarter or two, is that right? And is there anything, I guess, as we have kind of gotten to the first couple of months of this that have caused you to think that maybe that timeline could shorten or conversely lengthen? Brent Lang : I think it's right on track. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the pipeline has grown faster than I originally anticipated. The timeframe for converting that to bookings and revenue is, I think, still consistent with where we thought it was going to be. In reality, it was pretty close to the end of the quarter when we first started making these initial shipments. So there still hasn't been a ton of time for them to be in the evaluation mode. But we have been really encouraged by the volume of the pipeline, the number of deals. And it's important to point out that the pipeline that gets generated from these Smartbadge evaluations have both a hardware component to it for the Smartbadge plus batteries and chargers, but it also has a software component and services component to it, because in many cases there will be drag along revenue associate with that. So we are tracking pipeline, both from pure hardware perspective as well from a total dollar value and very encouraged by what we have seen so far. Again, just to mention, our expectations and financial model remain pretty low for the first half of the year in terms of recognizing revenue from that. And it's part of what helps us drive the second half seasonality in the business. Sean Dodge : Okay. And then on the international front, you guys had mentioned seeing a little bit of a wall there in the fourth quarter. Is there any update you can provide on the initiatives that you had talked about there and how those are going and then maybe the trajectories through the first quarter? Brent Lang : Yes. So revenue from international in the first quarter was right on par with where it has been over the last couple of years, just right around 10%. We continue to be encouraged by the activity that's going on there in building out the teams in the local markets. From a marketing perspective, we are starting to do more localized collateral, more localized marketing campaigns, some field marketing activity to drive pipeline. So it's in process. I don't think there has been any dramatic shift yet, but we are hopeful that that will continue to drive growth in the businesses as we move forward. International, because it's a small piece of our business, can be a little lumpier than the business overall. And so we monitor that on an extended timeframe. But I am pleased with the activity that we have had and I am pleased with the investment that we have made there both on the sales side and services as well as on the marketing side to drive demand there. Sean Dodge : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the David Larson with Leerink. Your line is open. David Larson : Hi. Can you talk about the competitive environment? I think Cerner has the CareAware solution and Hill-Rom recently acquired, I think, Voalte. What does your win rate look like and are you seeing any sort of change in that, given these two other competitors? Thanks. Brent Lang : Hi Dave. Thanks for the question. We really have not seen much of a change in our competitively win rate. It remains up in the 70% to 80% of the deals that we are involved in, we end up winning. Obviously, the Cerner CareAware product has been in the market for some time. It hasn't been a big impact on the market dynamics. And the Voalte, Hill-Rom transaction actually hasn't even closed yet. So that certainly hasn't had any impact yet on the marketplace. We think that the competitive activity here is actually good news. It's really validating a market that we have essentially created. And I think a validation that it's a large market that it's a growing market that it's a strategically important market. I still feel really comfortable with our competitive differentiation, both in terms of our technology, our clinical expertise, the breadth of our product offering, the device of choice aspect of our business as well as the one-stop shop aspect of being able to get the complete solution from a single vendor. So I encourage the competitive aspect of it. I think it's a good thing for the overall market. And so far, we continue to see very, very high win rates in the market and continue to be the clear market leader. David Larson : Okay. And then just any color on the sales force? Have there been any changes there or not? Any changes in the commission rates? Any color around, like the activities of the sales force would be very helpful or structure of the sales force would be helpful? Thanks. Brent Lang : Yes. Hi Dave. No significant changes in our sales force. We continue to have an incentive structure that we think is well aligned with where we are wanting to take the business strategically. We continue to invest in the strategic accounts part of our sales force and enhancing our capability there because that's where the market is continuing to evolve as more of the decision-making is taking place at the C-Suite. And we have also been making investments in international. But the overall size of our sales force continues to be relatively unchanged, a few additions here and there. What we have done in our broader sales organization and particularly in the international markets is we have added both to complement the salesperson, so clinical specialist, sales engineers, even support personnel in market in our international region to really bolster our ability to close deals and grow market share in those regions. David Larson : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Matthew Gillmor : Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the Hill-Rom acquisition. And I guess I would assume you have a lot of integrations with that company through Engage and I just wanted to see if you thought there was any risk that they could make those integrations harder in the future? Or would that just not make sense for anyone? I just wanted to understand that as a risk factor. Brent Lang : Yes. We have a long-standing relationship with Hill-Rom from an integration standpoint. We integrate with their nurse call system as we integrate with all the leading nurse call systems in the market. I think it would be highly unlikely that they would disable that. I think there is a large number of customers in our installed base and their installed base to leverage that nurse call integration and it's a very sticky integration, something that their customers and our customers rely upon. We have always prided ourselves on being agnostic and sort of the Switzerland of this market in terms of being willing to connect to a variety of different clinical systems. We are leveraging pretty standard open APIs unless they try to design them out in the future version of the product would be continue to be accessible to us and I am fairly confident that we will be able to maintain that relationship. So we will see, I guess, in the future. But I think from a customer relationship standpoint, that would be not a smart move on their part to try the block that integration. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. And then following up on the Nordstrom deal. I appreciate you are not in a position to provide many details, but I was curious if you could just remind us for a general retail client, not Nordstrom, sort of what the unit economics are? Brent Lang : On a store basis or a personnel basis or what? Matthew Gillmor : I guess I was thinking on a user basis or a per device basis. Brent Lang : Q - Matthew Gillmor Got it. And then following up on the Nordstrom deal. I appreciate you are not in a position to provide many details, but I was curious if you could just remind us for a general retail client, not Nordstrom, sort of what the unit economics are. A - Brent Lang On a store basis or a personnel basis or what --? Q - Matthew Gillmor I guess I was thinking on a user basis or a per device basis. Brent Lang : Yes. The model works very similar to our healthcare business where we price the badges on a unit basis as well as the software licenses. And then Nordstrom has purchased maintenance contract in conjunction with the software and then there are some professional services work. The roll-out now, we are going to be deploying this across a majority of their stores. So we will begin with the shipment of the badges, one tranche of the badges and the software here in Q2. And then some of the professional, some of those deployments and go-lives will start to happen in Q2 and then progressing for the next several quarters. But the model is very similar to what we, the economic model is very similar to what we have on the healthcare side. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mohan Naidu with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Mohan Naidu : Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick ones on the ATO from DoD. Can you help us understand what's the additional market opportunity that we can go after with this one? And since most of these contracts are sole source to you, do you have any insights in when they will materialize? Brent Lang : Yes. Hi Mohan. So if you look at the total number of medical centers which are the big medical facilities that are in the DoD, by our estimate, about half of them are within the Army and about half of them are within the Navy and the Air Force. So it's essentially doubling the size of the market opportunity. We have had a little bit of success in the Navy in the past, but it was on an exception basis. What this ATO does is basically gives us the ability to sell into any of those Air Force and Navy facilities. It's gotten good visibility across the federal government budgeting process and decision making process. But it's always really hard to predict the timing of when something might happen on a broader basis. We are really encouraged by the ongoing conversation that we are having with those various branches of the DoD. And I think that our track record has been very positive. One of the things about the win at the Air Force Academy, which I think is particularly interesting, is that they are planning to do a study to measure some of the impacts at that facility similar to the work that was done with the Army facility in Colorado several years ago before the Army started rolling out to the rest of their facilities. And we think that that will be a great tool for us to then use as we go to additional Air Force facilities. So I can't really make a prediction of when this might happen but I would tell you that it's very encouraging conversations and our level of visibility and our level of comfort that we will continue to win that business increases every day. Mohan Naidu : Thanks Brent. And maybe a quick one on general federal deals that got pushed out of Q4. You had given 2019, I guess so far how many have closed? And do you think that you will have an year-over-year growth in those deals? Brent Lang : Yes. So the federal bookings in Q1 were a combination of some of the deals that had moved out of Q4 and then some deals that were new that had been forecasted for Q1 from a prior forecasting. I think we are feeling really good about the fed business. I don't want to put a forecast in for the full year, but I would tell you that we feel like there's increasing momentum there. Mohan Naidu : All right. Thanks a lot, Brent. Operator : Your next question is from Vikram Kesavabhotla with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about your deferred revenue and backlog balance. It looks like it was down about $2 million from the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense for what that sequential trend has been like in prior years so we can understand the impact of the Smartbadge versus maybe the typical seasonality in the business? And then as a follow-up, I know in the past you have talked about achieving a faster conversion of the backlog and deferred revenue. Can you give us a sense for what that timeline is typically like and if there's been any change there given the recent business you have won? Thanks. Brent Lang : Yes. Hi Vikram. Yes, we were really pleased with how the combined backlog and deferred revenue ended up in Q1. That's just a benchmark here. So we were up year-over-year. That's the more appropriate way to evaluate the backlog and deferred revenue. So it was really nice to see that in our actual product backlog, which is what converts to revenue the most quickly, was up nicely here in Q1 year-over-year as well as sequentially. As a result of the strength in our bookings from a sequential standpoint, meaning from Q4 to Q1, we saw the lowest decline that we have seen in a few years. So we were pleased to see that, meaning that on the revenue and the bookings that we generated in Q1, we were able to keep our backlog and deferred revenue at a solid level that sets us up with good visibility as we head into the second quarter. In terms of actual conversion, the thing that has changed over the last 12 to 18 months or so is with the adoption of the accounting standard 606, our software revenue recognition has been able to convert a bit more quickly, meaning we have been able to convert our software backlog and our deferred revenue in certain instances to revenue a bit more quickly than we could under the old standards. And so as a result, as we look into a quarter or a longer period of time and we touched on this a little bit on our last call when we issued our 2019 guidance, we are actually able to convert our backlog and deferred revenue a bit more quickly than we were two, three, four years ago under the old standard. So nothing's changed in the last quarter, but over the last year or so since we have been operating under ASC 606, that's a new paradigm for not just us but all companies that are perpetual, have a large component of their software that is perpetual. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open. Lucas Baranowski : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Lucas, on for Matt Hewitt. Really just one quick one here. Operating expenses, it looks like those came in a bit lower than we were expecting this quarter. Should we kind of expect those to tick back up starting next quarter? Justin Spencer : Yes. There will be a little bit of a, first of all, Q1 is usually, we did have some bigger expenditures in Q1 particularly around HIMSS and this new Smartbadge. But we have purposely wanted to manage our expenses tightly so that we could invest in the areas that are going to drive growth. As we look forward to Q2 and in the second half, we do expect our operating expenses to be a little bit higher than they were in Q1, mostly because we continue to hire in the growth parts of our business, namely in R&D and sales and marketing. So there will likely be a little bit more operating or spending, I should say, overall in our business in Q2 and in Q3 and Q4. Not a huge amount, but certainly in all likelihood over and above what we saw in Q1. Lucas Baranowski : Okay. And then just one last question here. Non-GAAP gross margin, it sounds like that will be ticking up again in Q2, in line with the historical pattern. But I mean, when we look at last year, it was kind of, call it a smaller uptick, maybe 50 basis points. I mean should we expect maybe a little more of an increase than that this year? Justin Spencer : Yes. And our gross margin and to a large extent our overall profitability because of the leverage that we have in our business that affects the gross margin and profitability, so large increases in revenue which we expect in Q2 sequentially. The top end of our guidance range is $45 million and so a $10 million increase will generate more leverage in the model both at the gross margin level and the profitability level. And that will inherently drive more, higher percentage gross margin and a higher percentage of profit. Additionally, the product components of our revenue, namely our device and software, we expect to even be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 and those inherently have higher margins as well. And so to the extent that we are successful at driving a solid product and revenue mix, that would be another important contributor for us to seeing not just our gross margin, but our operating margins will also improve. Lucas Baranowski : Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I had. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Stephanie Demko with Citi. Your line is open. Stephanie Demko : Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Now I know we touched on this a lot in the last quarter's call, but could you give us some more color on the ramp to the second half of the year? We have got the moving pieces with the Smartbadge that you said would be previously back-end weighted. There is a lumpiness of large software deals. Is there any potential that we see some improvement in 2Q and 3Q? Brent Lang : Hi Stephanie. Thanks for the question. So if you think about the ramp in the second half, there's really four components that I would point you to. The first was the one that you mentioned which is the ramp of the Smartbadge which will have an increase in both hardware and software revenue tied to it as we see that as driving some incremental growth. The second is the fed business which is always strongest in Q3 and typically will generate higher bookings and revenue in the back half of the year. The third element would be the Nordstrom revenue. And as Justin mentioned, the revenue from the Nordstrom's deployments will start in Q2 and then proceed through Q3 and in the back half of the year. So you will see some impact from that. And then the fourth component would be international where we typically see more strength in international in the back half of the year. And if we hit our plan, that will be a driver for the growth in the second half of the year. Stephanie Demko : And when you gave the original guidance, were you expecting this level of software lumpiness? Brent Lang : This level of, I am sorry, software lumpiness? Stephanie Demko : Yes. The software lumpiness in the first quarter. Like, is it safe to assume that the ramp is now steeper? Or has it just shifted around from device versus software revenue? Justin Spencer : Yes. Hi Stephanie. No, right as expected. We knew we had the difficult compare. Compared to Q1 last year with a large $2 million shipment and that happens from time to time with some very large customers and tying the software shipments there. So software and device for that matter kind of played out right as we expected and we built a nice healthy backlog on both device and software. So we feel comfortable with what we expect and assume in Q2 to roll-up to the guidance. And then Nordstrom is one of a few different deals that we think will help contribute to further ramp as we head into the back half of the year, as Brent described. Stephanie Demko : All right. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then one quick one on the Nordstrom deal. It sounds like that's a solution that would be better on the Smartbadge. Is it just timing that prevent them from going for that? Or is there anything else? Brent Lang : It's primarily timing, yes. They had been evaluating the previous version of the badge, the B3000n. They ran their pilots and trials using that and they budgeted for it based on the B3000n. So we were virtually at the finish line of that particular deal when we made the announcement of the Smartbadge. And they were perfectly comfortable moving forward. They like the sleek aspect of the previous B3000n badge. They are not doing a lot of text messaging or messaging alerts to the badge. They are doing some but not as extensive as some of the healthcare customers. So I think the B3000n is a great device for them and it met their budget criteria and was what they were very comfortable with based on the pilots that they had run. Stephanie Demko : All right. That's it from me. Thank you guys. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of the calls. I will now turn things back over to Brent Lang for any closing remarks. Brent Lang : Thank you. I appreciate all of the questions and the participation today and we look forward to following up with you with more detailed questions and seeing you out on the road. Thanks for your time today.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Shantel, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during the conference call today will include forward-looking statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release. There is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine with an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. With organic growth of 8.5% our Q2 results reflect excellent momentum in all three segments MedSurg, Orthopaedics and Neurotechnology and Spine. MedSurg delivered a roughly 12% organic sales increase with strong performances across the Board. Instruments had a particularly strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth and we were pleased with the performances in medical, endoscopy and sustainability. Looking ahead, we assume continued robust organic growth for all MedSurg divisions in the second half. Orthopaedics was up 6% in Q2 with hips gaining 4% and knees up roughly 6% as a Mako robot sales and increased robot utilization across both joint applications are driving implant share gains. Neurotechnology and Spine delivered 7% growth powered by another quarter of double-digit gains in neurotechnology. We have also made considerable progress in the integration of K2M and are on track with our full year growth target for spine. On a geographic base, the US was up 9% and international was up 7%. We continue to see the benefits of our Trans-Atlantic operating model with high single digit growth in Europe. Given our lower market shares in this region, we are well positioned to continue to grow meaningfully above market in 2019 and beyond. Our international performance also included strong double-digit gains in emerging markets. With the strong top line and ongoing focus on our cost transformation initiatives, we achieved operating margin expansion of 20 basis points, which includes considerable deal related dilution. Our adjusted per share earnings in Q2 came in at $1.98, topping the high end of our targeted range of $1.90 to $1.95, which is driven by our robust sales performance. We also continue to benefit from investments in R&D, acquisitions, sales and marketing, which translate into healthy product pipelines and strong commercial execution. That, combined with our talented employees and culture of performance, positions us well to sustain high growth going forward. With that I will now turn the call over Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. My update today will focus on Mako and the key data points that allow you to track our success in executing on our orthopedic robotic strategy. In addition, we will continue to provide our new growth, which excludes any robot revenue. As a reminder, sales tied to Mako continue to be included in our other orthopedic revenue line, while navigation is reported in instruments. In Q2, we sold 44 Mako robots globally with 35 in the US. By comparison in the comparable quarter a year ago, we installed a total of 39 robots of which 29 were in the US. Globally, our installed base of robots is north of 700, with close to 600 in the US. Looking at US procedures, in Q2, Mako total knee procedures exceeded 18,000, increasing approximately 80% from the prior year quarter, while total Mako procedures approximated 27,000. We are also pleased with the acceleration we are seeing in our hip performance. These results reflect uptake for our new 3D-printed Trident II hip cup, as well as increasing utilization of Mako for hip procedures, where we achieved strong double-digit procedure growth in the quarter. Based on these performances, it's clear we are continuing to see high demand for Mako given its unique features as well as applications that span hips, knees and [indiscernible] combined with a robust order book that positions us well to see ongoing success both in robot sales and recon market share gains. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Katherine. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. We have provided our detailed financial results in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 8.5% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q2, 2018. As we've said before selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 1.6% impact on sales. US organic sales growth was 9.3% in international organic sales growth was 6.5%. In the US, there were strong performances across Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology. International sales growth demonstrated solid gains in Europe, emerging markets and Australia. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.98 increased 12% from the prior year, reflecting strong drop-through on sales growth combined with good operating expense control. Our second quarter EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 from foreign currency exchange rates, including translational and transactional impacts, which was consistent with our expectations at the start of the quarter. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency and organic growth of 5, 6% including US organic growth of 6.5%. This performance was highlighted by strong performances in knees at 6.6%, hips at 5.4% and recon capital of over 30%. Some of the key drivers of performance in the quarter included strong demand for our Mako TKA need platform, 3D-printed products and shoulder implants. Internationally, Orthopaedics delivered organic growth of 3.6% reflecting strong growth in emerging markets. MedSurg continued to have strong growth across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 12.5% and organic gains of 11.5%, which included a 12.9% increase in the US. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 18.9%. We continue to see benefit from the sales force split with robust growth in power tools and waste management products. Endoscopy delivered US organic sales growth of 8.2%. Endoscopy's video business grew double-digits as its new 1688 camera platform continues to ramp, along with its NOVADAQ product lines. Medical had US organic growth of 11.9% reflecting solid performance in its bed, stretcher and Sage Products. Within Sage, we continue to see strong demand for Prevalon and PrimaFit. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 6.2%, which reflects strong sales in emerging markets, including China. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 20.8% and organic growth of 7.4%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products, offset by somewhat slower spine organic growth as we continue to integrate our legacy Spine business with K2M. our US Neurotech business posted organic growth of 8.9% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our hemorrhagic, ischemic stroke, CMF and our neuro powered instruments products. The spine business continue to effectively focus on the K2M integration including the field sales organization. During the quarter, we completed activities related to product training and cross-selling. Sales exited the quarter with mid single-digit growth in the US. Our IVF business continues to demonstrate strong double-digit growth trends, buying remains committed to mid single digit growth for the full year. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 12.4%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand across most geographies for our Neurotech products Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.8% was down 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by productivity and efficiency, which was offset by price, foreign exchange and business mix. R&D spending was 6.4% of sales, which was slightly favorable to the prior year quarter. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.5% of sales, which was 40 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth program including key projects focused on indirect purchasing and shared services. This is offset by the negative impact of acquisitions and continued planned investments in our CTG program efforts. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which was approximately 20 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Our operating margin reflects good leverage and continued operational savings offset by key investments and acquisitions, the latter of which had an approximately 30 basis points negative impact on the quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment of driving 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin. Next, I'll provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses decreased slightly from prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable interest income. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16% reflects our operating tax rate favorably impacted by the benefit related to stock compensation expenses. Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 40% was held outside the US. Total debt on the balance sheet with $8.5 billion. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $827 million. This reflects strong net earnings offset by increases in core working capital and planned integration costs related to K2M. And now I will discuss our third quarter guidance. Based on our performance to date and anticipated strength in the remainder of the year, we now expect organic annual sales growth will be in the range of 7.5% to 8% for 2019. As a reminder, Q3 and the full year have one additional selling day and Q4 has the same number of selling days as 2018. Given our year-to-date performance and continuing momentum, we now expect that our adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $8.15 to $8.25 for the full year. For the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92. Foreign currency translation and transaction impact included in EPS is expected to be minimal in Q3 and negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 for the full year. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed. Bob Hopkins : Hi. Thanks and good afternoon, and congrats on a really strong revenue result here and strong result overall. I was intrigued by your comments on hip growth and the kind of the growing influence of Mako driving your hip growth. Could you just spend a second, talking about the outlook for Mako in hips and is this the beginning of a stronger trend? Just trying to get a sense for where you think this is going? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Bob. We were pleased. We are seeing an increased Mako adoption for the hip application, if some of it comes, as they start to see the benefits from these, which could be the - in many cases what drive the initial purchase, they start to think about using it on more procedures. So it's kind of a natural evolution of the adoption. And I think when you combine that with our 3D-printed cup, it's a pretty powerful impact that we're seeing. So we think we're going to continue to see some strong gains in hips on Mako as well as obviously with knees. Bob Hopkins : Thank you for that. And then just one quick follow-up for Glenn on gross margins. Just curious if you could comment on where gross margins are going from here. I recognize that FX in mix were the drag this quarter, but maybe you could quantify FX and just given the really strong results, talk a little bit about where gross margins could go over the course of the rest of the year? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. We typically don't guide on gross margin, but I'll tell you, I mean, gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by price and product mix, especially as the business shifts towards med surgeon Neurotech, if you look at sort of the growth rates across our businesses. And then, frankly on the other side, those negative impacts were offset by newly acquired businesses as the spine businesses have higher gross margins. We really expect progressive improvement in gross margin throughout the rest of this year and for the second half of 2019. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Kevin, just starting with you, you could follow up. Instruments were much stronger than expected and then given that strength in 1688 in the back half for endo, what's driving that instrument strength and given the product catalyst for endo? Can these two segments, deliver double-digit performance in the back half of the year? Kevin Lobo : So I wouldn't extrapolate Q2's Instruments result for the future quarters. We will have a very strong instrument year overall, but it was particularly strong in Q2. Occasionally, we've seen this in the past where we've had a -- we'll call it an extra pop in one quarter, but we do expect continued strong performance and think about the 1688, it's a progressive ramp. Normally the second year of a camera launch tends to be the larger year, but we do expect endoscopy to also have a strong second half and it's sort of progressive. It will progressively build-up related to 1688. So we're optimistic of a very strong MedSurg second half. David Lewis : And then Kevin just Neurotech, the gross has been very stable over the last three quarters, momentum slowed a bit this quarter. Your pipelines more impactful next year, but anything that you call out either on share or market dynamics here, now the first-half isn't? Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So we're really pleased with our Neurotech business continues to roll with strong performances globally. It was a little bit softer in the US in the second quarter, but nothing particular that I want to call out. I would say that aspiration will be much more meaningful next year than it is this year and I think we've talked a lot about that on prior calls, no change to that. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much. I also want to congratulate you on a really strong quarter. Following up on the robots in the quarter and the growth year-over-year and one of the questions we get often is just around how some of the other competitors in the space might be affecting decision cycles or anything like that in the field in terms of evaluations or RFPs. If you could just give us any color on that? And then I have one follow-up. Katherine Owen : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We have not, and don't expect to see any competitive impact as I alluded to on the call. The order book is very robust. We're seeing really strong uptake in terms of robot sales as well as the utilization rates and you can see that in some of the data points provided in the quarter. So we are really pleased with what we're seeing within Mako and the fact that we're now really starting to see indications across all the joint procedures and reconstructive joint procedures starting to see more of a lift to, so really good momentum. Matt Miksic : That's great. And then follow-up on spine. You are approaching the sort of the full-year cycle of this integration on the front end as you've talked about and across operations, but one of the opportunities there obviously K2 had a pretty strong 3D-printed spine implant portfolio. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the opportunity or the timeline for migrating that to your platform or expanding it under your umbrella or any efforts that you see as important opportunities to play out over the next 12 to 18 months? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, Thanks for the question. First of all we only closed in November of last year. So I would call it, more like the half-year mark right now, very, very pleased with the momentum and expecting acceleration in the second half of this year. Now that we've cross sold at the -- train the reps on cross-selling and we continue to build the sets and the instruments needed for the K2M products for the legacy spine reps. So we're excited about the outlook for the future. Certainly, we had a terrific 3D-printing capability and the cascadial line of products with K2M were also -- they had a very, very complete product line. So we're really excited about having leadership and 3D-printing in spine. And we do plan to sell the full range of portfolio of products. As it related to product and tech transfers, that's going to happen very gradually and it's not something I really want to get into on the call right now. Matt Miksic : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed. Josh Jennings : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just start on margin. I mean, clearly it's a back half weighted [indiscernible] and maybe you could just help. I know you talked a little bit about on the prepared remarks, Glenn, but maybe talk a little bit about the drivers in the back half that can get you out to the 30 basis points to 50 basis points range and I mean should be thinking about the lower end of that range or is there really no incremental guidance there? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. At this point, I'm not. I'm not going to commit to sort of a more detailed level of guidance other than to say that the 30 bps to 50 bps, we're still sticking to that. A couple of things that will help us obviously things accelerate in the back half of the year, in terms of sales and profits. We'll also start to see less integration cost coming through from K2 and more results of their operations, which also should help the margin. And so those things combined really to give us confidence that we'll get to our 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Josh Jennings : Great. And then just a follow-up on Mako. Significant success in knees and it sounds like hips are picking up. I just wanted to ask about the pipeline there and if there's nothing to share at this point, any timelines in terms of when you may share with the street, other indications that are in development? Thanks again. Katherine Owen : Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Nothing additional to share at this point. I think as we've talked before we're prioritizing our research efforts on new indications in spine and in shoulder, but that's a ways off. And honestly, we have so much momentum right now in knees and hips. Increasingly, the organization is really focused on continuing to sell robots and build on that. Just really pleased, especially as we start to see hospitals purchasing additional robots being driven by those utilization growth rates that we're seeing. So that's going to continue to be the focus on what you're going to hear us primarily speaking about. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is open. You may proceed. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Start with the trauma and extremities business. It was a little bit softer than what we were expecting. I know last quarter you called out the T2 delay, has that product now launched? And how do you just feeling about the trauma and extremities businesses? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, Chris. The product has launched and if you look at it, trauma had sequential improvement in US sales growth as sort of as well as new products begin to ramp up. We also saw improvements in the supply chain, which was one of the things that was slowing things a little bit. Moving forward, we expect that the sequential growth will continue to improve in the back half of the year and so we're confident that is going to get better. Kevin Lobo : These launches just do take some time. So it's a gradual improvement in the availability of implants and instruments for the sales force. So it will progressively improve over the course of the year. Chris Pasquale : That's helpful, thanks. And then just could you give us an update on where you are cementless mix stands in knees today? Katherine Owen : Yeah. So, as we indicated on the last call, we're not going to give quite a level of detail. We -- as you heard in my prepared comments, we've given you, I think a decent amount to be able to track robots. We're continuing to see uptake for cementless. It does exceed 30%. But we're not going to get much more specific than that other than to say, it continues to increase. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Robbie Marcus : Great. And thanks for taking the question. Maybe I could follow up with another spine question and just ask you, we've seen so many integrations go by the wayside and had issues early on. What is it exactly that you're doing maybe differently? What have you learned that this integration is going according to plan? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think it's several factors. We spent an enormous amount of time evaluating the market, the targets prior to making the decision to acquire K2M. We knew we had a strong cultural fit. We did a lot of due diligence around why prior deals didn't work and we also have been a very acquisitive company, which has really built up that muscle around thinking about how to integrate and we also are very comfortable with hybrid sales model as opposed to some of the spine deals that forced a switch totally to direct. And so they were just a lot of lessons learned in our own core capabilities in M&A. So there has been an enormous amount of work done by the organization in the first half of this year, a lot of integration efforts, but we're really pleased and as we said, we remain on target on track to hit our full year growth targets in the mid-single digits for spine. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. And maybe just one for Glenn or Kevin. As you look at the med tech sector, you have plenty of balance sheet capacity to do more deals, what's your current view on the space in valuations and what are your thoughts right now on M&A versus share repurchase? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : As we've said from the beginning of being the CEO that acquisitions will be the number one priority for cash and you've seen over -- whatever period you want to look at three-year, five-year, 10-year, more than 50% of our cash does get deployed on acquisitions. We still have a very robust pipeline across our divisions of active targets. Valuation is always a challenge. It's not a new challenge. It's been a challenge for the past few years and that's why number one reason why we do walk away from deals. We'll continue to be disciplined acquirer, but we, right now don't see any change in our capital allocation philosophy given the robust pipeline that we currently have. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really nice [indiscernible] here. Kevin, maybe a big picture question on our pipeline. Given the strength, we're seeing what would you highlight for us when we look at the next year? I know -- I know the camera launch and some of the products you spoke about. Is there anything on Sage? I think I heard you guys talk about Sage. There are some talks about a new bed. Just help us up put these new product cycles in the context of a really strong CapEx environment? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I'll probably take that. I would tell you, across the board, whether it's 2019 or looking ahead to 2020, we have a number of product launches, similar to prior years that are slated and that includes medical as well as other division. So I think that really is what underscores our conviction and being able to grow sales at the high end of MedTech. We don't want to get into specifics around the launches for obvious reasons, but I would tell you we have a really good cadence and pipelines across all three of the primary businesses. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So we've shown a real sustainability of growth, if you go back four or five years, and it's been steadily building. And as our acquisitions role in, they roll into organic growth and that gives us the ability to continue to accelerate our growth. So right now as we sit here today, I'm very optimistic thinking ahead 2020. Vijay Kumar : And just add one quick follow-up. Glenn, on the 3Q was there an extra day for 3Q? So I'm just curious why EPS for 3Q would step down sequentially? Is there some timing element either on expenses or below the line items for the 3Q EPS figure? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, it's just -- you know it's a little bit of seasonality and I really don't think there's any one thing to point to relative to our guidance on Q3. And I think we'll continue with strong sales growth. We obviously took up our range in sales growth so we feel that come through and we feel that level of performance in Q3 will be reflective of that sales growth. Vijay Kumar : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Very nice quarter. I have a big picture question, a specific one. Big picture, Kevin, do you have an opinion on where we're going with the medical device tax? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So obviously, we are expecting that the medical device tax that will not be reinstated. It's due to be reinstated at the beginning of next year. In our strategic plan, we assume it won't be, that there'll be some. There are a number of vehicles between now and the end of the year that it could be attached. Full repeal I think is probably not likely, we're hopeful, and we're lobbying through our trade association for full repeal, but there is bipartisan support both in the Senate and the House to not reinstate the medical device tax. So I believe we'll get some type of extension, whether it's two years or more. There is always a risk that it comes back, but I would tend to cap it as a low-risk right now. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. And then specific to your business trauma and extremities were better sequentially is still not where I would expect it to be, what does it take to sort of move that up to the market rate? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Certainly, we're not below the market rate and we haven't been below the market rate for seven years. We outperformed the market very dramatically four or five years ago. We've moved a little bit closer to the market rate, but I would tell you that the supply chain issues that we had in the first quarter are getting better. We're not fully healthy and we have the short stem launch in shoulder as well as T2 Alpha launches, which are gradually building and so we do expect an improvement sequentially in Q3 and Q4. And so the result was a slight improvement from Q1 and I do expect us to continue to improve going forward. Joanne Wuensch : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. One on pricing, one big picture. So pricing in ortho and MedSurg got better to a point that we haven't seen in a while. So, I'm just curious why that happened in the sustainability of it? And is it, how much was just due to lapping the Japan price cuts? And I had one follow-up? Glenn Boehnlein : You know, pricing was less negative in Q2 than we've seen in recent quarters. I think the most sort of recent impact were felt from favorability in our implant businesses, but most of that came from positive mix from joint replacement in OUS pricing. And then we also saw some improvements in spine pricing, but mainly because rebates have declined relative to our legacy spine business. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. And then Kevin your MedSurg accelerated across all segments as you said, I'm just curious how much was driven by healthy or end markets versus Stryker specific drivers. And if you could just comment on what you're seeing just in the end markets, Q2 versus Q1? It looks like Q2 maybe a little more buoyant than Q1 in general. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, it's a little early in the reporting cycle to comment on the full end markets. I would tell you that MedSurg has historically -- if you look at the growth rates, it has historically been based on our own performance. The launching of our products, the debt [ph] splitting of our sales forces. I look at the Sage's great performance has really been after the following the recalls a while back, we've really gained momentum. The pre-method launch is fantastic and going extremely well. And so, a number of new product launches, that tends to be the reason for our success and that's not any different in the second quarter. Of course Instruments did really port on in the quarter, but they had a sales force split at the beginning of the year and they are really performing extremely well. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the instrument growth again. I think if you look at the stack comps for 1Q '19 versus 2Q '19, it continues to accelerate. Can you give a little more detail on why waste management or power tools are growing this fast and how long this can continue? Kevin Lobo : So I think we mentioned on the prior quarter call that we split our sales force. So there was a one sales force selling power tools and waste management, part of the catalyst for the split was the acquisition of Invuity. And so that was put together with waste management and some other products and we call that parts surgical technologies. And then the other part is called orthopedic Instruments, which has the power tools, bone cement, the protective device, the protective gowns for the surgeon and so a number of other products that are in that category. Two different call points and that's split of the sales force is going extremely well and they have a strong orders and converted those orders into strong sales in the second quarter. So we do expect to continued strong performance throughout the year. Again, I believe, this was an outsized performance. I wouldn't expect another number like this in the third or fourth quarter, but certainly a strong number expected for the full year. Pito Chickering : Great. Then for a follow-up from a margin perspective, if you didn't have dosing from acquisitions, which have an SG&A leverage, could you see when organic revenue growth is in the 7.5% to 8% range? Kevin Lobo : If there wasn't -- you said if there wasn't an impact from acquisitions, what kind of op margin growth would we have? Pito Chickering : Correct. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, I mean, we usually disclose that number. So it really has ranged anywhere from -- if I add back the acquisitions to 50 basis points to even 90 basis points of op margin expansion. Pito Chickering : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may proceed. Craig Bijou : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. You called out shoulder implant growth in the script. So what don't you just see, if you could provide a little bit more color on what drove that strength in the quarter? And when you think about investment in your multiple businesses, how important or how much allocation of your investment -- internal investment is going to the shoulder business? Kevin Lobo : I think you all know that we have a very low market share in shoulder. We've progressively been launching new products over the past few years. So we have a primary shoulder, a reverse shoulder fracture system, and now a shorter stem. We still don't have so stemless, so stemless is still in our pipeline that's coming fairly soon. We also don't have a lot of international approvals for shoulder. We had some regulatory challenges. So this is primarily a US business right now. But just on the back of these launches, we've gained a lot of momentum in shoulder. These are very good products and it just takes time for our sales force to be able to get that in front of customers. And until you have a fairly full line, we now have, what I would call a full line, so even though we're missing stemless, that's not enough of an objection for our sales force. Not to be able to sell it. So we've been seeing very nice uptake in shoulders over the past year or so, recognizing it's still a very small business within the overall Stryker picture, but this is something we are excited about. It's a good market with a lot of growth potential, and we're going to continue to focus on it. Craig Bijou : Thanks. And I'll stick with shoulder for my follow up. Just, Kevin, I think in the past you guys have talked about going to a specialty sales force for shoulder specifically. I just wanted to see if you have done that yet to any extent, and the plans for the future if you have not? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. We have some specialization, but I would call it modest. There is obviously a huge cost burn every time you go to specialization and you have to able to drive significant revenue. We've done that in the past as I already mentioned on this call with Instruments dedicating splitting the sales force and going to specialization. Shoulder procedures are really more fragmented. A lot of them are done by the same surgeons that do hips and knees. You do have some upper extremity specialists, but the call point is a little more fragmented. So it's not as obvious to go to a fully dedicated sales force. There is a huge SG&A burn to do that. So I think this is one that would be a little bit more gradual where it makes sense and certain MSAs will go to specialized sales reps, but I wouldn't call it a full. We're not going to go to fully specialized sales force for some time. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. You may proceed. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So you did touch on this on the earlier question. I was hoping that you could expand on the impact, the aspiration launch could have in neuro and other pipeline enhancements that could help that business moving through this year and into next? Katherine Owen : Yeah, with aspiration as we're working to get the full range of products on the market that's really the -- what's behind our comments around thinking about that having more of an impact in 2019. So we're looking at excuse me, 2020. So we're looking at launching a broader range of aspiration devices than we currently have on the market around the Q1 time frame. And so that's really how you should be thinking about the impact from that, our entry into that segment of the ischemic market. Matt Taylor : Okay. And then just on the instruments growth, was really impressive mostly highlighted, when you look through to next year, how does the sales force split anniversary. Can you still grow strongly next year over this initial part that you're getting? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think what you're seeing is just really strong momentum, from the sales force split, from acquisitions that have been integrated and it's from new product launches from internal innovation and R&D and all of that will continue into 2020. So I'm not going to get into specific numbers. And as we've commented before, it is certainly an outsized quarter, so you want to model accordingly, but there's a lot of momentum across -- instruments and really across the organization. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. This is JP [ph] on for Matt. I just want to touch on spine for a second. You mentioned that the K2 acquisition is kind of going as planned, but I want to see if you could touch on first just sales force attrition and then, for that business scoliosis summer months are usually pretty strong for them. So maybe while we're in the midst of it, comment on how do you think your share is holding up in the scoliosis side of things? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think it's a little early in the reporting season. You are right. June tends to be a strong scoliosis month and you heard comments from Glenn around the momentum we saw as we exited the quarter that really does underscore our confidence and the outlook for the full year. I don't think there's anything specific to get into around sales force attrition. One of the appeals of this target with the fact that we had a really strong cultural fit. We were bringing in a great leader with Eric. We had minimal customer overlap and we are comfortable with and continue to be a hybrid sales model, all of which were in factors behind what we expected to be fairly limited attrition. So I think I'll just leave the comments there. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful and then just one on -- just ortho is good all around, but the US continues to outpace the OUS growth rates and just given how big the opportunity for you guys is, OUS, is there any, you can do to maybe on the investment side to kind of accelerate that OUS ortho growth? Kevin Lobo : I think the disparity that you're seeing is really related to Mako because we've had Mako on the market for quite some time in the United States and we are really just launching Mako in two very important markets, China and Japan. We now have approval for the total knee in Japan as well as hip. In China, we have the hip approval, we're still awaiting for the total knee approval, which should be coming shortly. Those are going to be exciting markets for us. We're just in the very, very early stages of that launch. So what you're seeing from a disparity from international to US is really the make-up FX [ph], which is more pronounced in the US. But starting to grow, as you see with our numbers, we are starting to place more and more robots outside the United States, but those two markets in particular, just getting started and so we're excited about the future that Mako will be able to bring to those two markets. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SBV Leerink. You may proceed. Richard Newitter\\: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about a question asked earlier on new indications for robotics. And I think you mentioned spine and then shoulder and I don't want to read into this, or is there anything to read into in that ordering. I had the impression that shoulder would potentially be in front of spine, even though you're not giving timelines precisely. Was there anything to that ordering? And then I have a follow-up on that? Katherine Owen : No, just the way to words came out right now. So nothing to that and again they're both a ways off, and so I wouldn't read anything into that. Richard Newitter\\: Okay. And so I appreciating that they're both a ways off, I guess, you guys have been and brought the most attention to the orthopedic robotic category through Mako. And you guys do not have a specific spine robotic application, but you have some larger competitors that are now coming into the marketplace, some new ones. What's the dynamic there being absent as the orthopedic robotic market leader in spine? How are the conversations going there? Do you feel any sense of urgency, Katherine, by your last comment, it sounds like no and if no, why? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think for us the key for our spine business was refreshing, what had become a bit of a dated portfolio getting a considerably larger organization and a real strong presence with the key opinion leaders, especially in the areas of deformity that shape a lot of their thought, that was the priority. And what we think is imperative, much like we see with Mako and knee, as you have to have a meaningful impact on the procedure, an application that really does change the dynamic or how the procedure is done, how it impacts the surgeon experience and obviously the patient experience. That's what we're focused on in spine and we think there's a real opportunity there. We are not seeing any push back in terms of our spine presence by not having a robot at this point. Richard Newitter\\: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. You may proceed. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi guys. You mentioned continued solid emerging markets growth in your prepared remarks. Since you are still under-levered there broadly in emerging markets, is that an area you've been accelerating investments and are there any particular product segments you see particularly opportunities in the emerging markets? Kevin Lobo : Given our presence in emerging markets, we have opportunity across our portfolio and I'm really pleased with the progress we made. Last year we grew double digits, this year it's strong double digits. And really the big change in the last -- let's call it six quarters is leaderships, where we've really bolstered leadership in many of the countries in Brazil, in India, in China. We bought out our distributor in Turkey and we're going a little bit more direct in Turkey. And in these markets we're having really terrific growth. So it really has been a leadership story, staring with the Managing Director in those countries as well as the next level down. And so it took us a few years to kind of get the leadership team that we wanted in place in these countries and now we're really starting to drive growth across the portfolio. Steven Lichtman : Thanks, Kevin. And Glenn, just. I apologize if I missed this, but latest thoughts on a free cash flow conversion and tax rate for the year? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, we -- if you look at sort of free cash flow in the way cash flow played out this quarter, we were a little under pressured as we mentioned before with cash expenditures related to the K2 integration. And so we expected the first half of this year to be a little bit lower. Typically, cyclically cash flow generation is always higher in the second half for us. We also see ramping of some of our initiatives around indirect spending, which will continue to deliver savings as well. We guide in the 70% to 80% conversion range and we think we'll be near that range again this year. And then as far as taxes, there is really no change to our guidance of 16% to 17%, although we are moderating towards the lower end of that range. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. You may proceed. Raj Denhoy : Hi, good afternoon. Maybe one for Katherine just around Mako. I'm curious when you think about the overall US knee market maybe being in the very, very low single-digits, you guys are growing 6.5% to 7%, of that delta, can you break out what percentage you think is pure kind of volume share gains versus any uptick, you guys are getting any mix benefit, price benefit you're getting from using robotics? Katherine Owen : Yeah, that's difficult to parse out. I would tell you the bulk of it is coming from volume and market share gains. We're selling a significant percent of our robot into competitive accounts obviously because we wouldn't be able to grow. If it was all -- at these rates it is all into Stryker accounts. But we do get some modest mixed benefit, but it's really -- it's powered first and foremost by Mako as well as our 3D-printed products having them indicated, our cementless knee indicated on at the Mako robot is a pretty powerful combination, but kind of break it down with the specifics that's just really challenging. Raj Denhoy : Okay. But your point is that it is mostly share gains, that's the real big delta. It's not any mixed benefits you are getting? Katherine Owen : Exactly. Raj Denhoy : Okay. And then just on those lines. I think the question was asked earlier, but you have a sort of major launch or at least a launch for a major company, I should say in robotics. Within those accounts, have you seen within the Zimmer accounts, has there been any change in tone of those customers being willing to entertain Mako, it's really any -- any change in the market broadly as it gets more competitive? Katherine Owen : Yeah, I would tell you, when we look at the performance in the quarter, I think it's just simply too soon. We are not seeing a competitive impact. I think our results really do underscore just how strong our momentum is with robots. We have a very large installed base and building off of that. We're just not seeing anything. This question is probably better directed at them because obviously they're going to better insights. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevin understanding your China presence is relatively modest. Any updates or color you can provide on maybe gaining a procedural demand or demand for capital in that market, just given some of the macro uncertainties here recently? Kevin Lobo : Well, you're right. I think you're being generous by saying we have a modest presence. We have a long way to go In China, it's really the most important of the emerging markets and given our presence we're really seeing Stryker being the rate-limiting factor, not the market. The market conditions are still for health care very good. And we just have to raise our game and which we've been doing over the last two years and really excited about the leader that we have there, but I don't see anything in the market that should cause us to slow down our momentum given where we are right now. Jeff Johnson : All right, great. And then Glenn, maybe just a clarifying question. You mentioned the spine rebates coming down as one of the helpful factors on pricing in the quarter. I just want to -- is that an industry wide comment do you feel or is that a mix shift from older Stryker product to the K2 products that's helping that? Just wondering if it's more Stryker specific that commentary or broader market commentary? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, it's really the result of sort of the -- our integration efforts and really a planned mix shift to the K2 products that we see really causing that impact? Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Great, thanks for taking my question. Katherine, you called out utilization up 80% in knees on Mako, and I'm just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the disparity between the users? Maybe, what you see from the top users and how much of the installed base has capacity in terms of further utilization or further optimization on those robots? Katherine Owen : Yeah, so the 80% referenced total knee procedures that were done in the quarter. It's very difficult to give you color around that. I mean we see adoption really across the board, high volume hospitals, lower volume rural, urban, teaching hospitals. It really -- it's driven first and foremost, is there a robotic champion in that hospital and that's what drives the placement or the sale of the robot. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. That's helpful. And then we have been asked a little bit before, but as a competitor does come into the market, how is the guidance contemplated in the sales cycle for Mako or what's the thoughts around an elongation of the sales cycle, just given what we're seeing maybe in the spinal robotics market with an elongating sales cycles. Do you anticipate that for the -- maybe the remainder of the year or potentially in the 2020? Thank you. Katherine Owen : Yeah, I think it's simply too soon. We have no color on that launch. And so I think it's simply too soon. So as we get closer to 2020, we'll certainly contemplate that, but I think as you can see from our guidance there's just a lot of momentum across the board in that, we're just not seeing any impact. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. You may proceed. Kyle Rose : Great, thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask another one on Mako. A lot of focus obviously on the competitive launch, but just wanted to see -- have you seen any changes as far as how hospitals are looking to acquire and pay for them. I know you've talked about your Flex Financial in the past, but are you seeing any that are looking more for utilization based agreements and things along those lines? Katherine Owen : No, Flex Financial has for years been a powerful tool for us. When we're selling capital, when we can contemplate different models based on their what might be capital budget versus operating budgets and leasing, etc. So we can look at number and continue to look at a number of different models, but I wouldn't say those comments aren't any different today than they would have been a year ago. Kyle Rose : And then the one follow-up is just the outpatient market, both for Mako, on the total knees and total hips, but then also more broadly from an orthopedic joint replacement perspective, what are you seeing in the dynamics of that market? Katherine Owen : Specifically in the dynamics, I'm sorry, of the Mako uptake in hips and knees. Kyle Rose : Yes in the outpatient environment. Katherine Owen : We do sell some robots in the outpatient. It's the minority. They obviously have a keen interest in it because the outpatient hospital or ASCs, they like the new technology and obviously, we're seeing more and more evidence of the impact this has for patients and outcomes that drives their interest. They have different capital challenges and so again we use Flex Financial to work with that, but the vast majority of the robots are not in the outpatient setting, they're still in the hospital base setting at this time. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Well, thank you for joining our call. As you can see we had a very strong Q2 results and strong momentum going into the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Sue Dooley of Vocera Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sue Dooley : Thank you. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Vocera\u2019s conference call to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings. Joining me today are Vocera\u2019s CEO, Brent Lang; and Justin Spencer, our CFO. Earlier this afternoon, we distributed a press release detailing our quarterly results. The release is posted on our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the Investor Relations page of our website where a replay will be archived. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties described in Vocera\u2019s filings with the SEC and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On this call we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The third quarter of 2019 was another solid quarter for Vocera with record revenue of $51 million and good profitability. As we entered Q4, we are excited by our large deal pipeline, our sizable market opportunity and our expanding product set, which has never been better. The highlights for the third quarter showcase our market appeal and highly differentiated offerings. Our success winning large deals continued with eight deals over $1 million made up of both expansions and new hospital wins. This included four large deals in our federal business, and we're on pace for another record year in the sense. Overall device shipments were at a record -- were at record levels, and we are encouraged by how the Smartbadge is building momentum. Our investments in international are driving results with substantial year-over-year bookings growth, including two international deals over $1 million. Finally, in Q3, our pace of innovation continued, including the launch of our next generation smartphone app, the Vocera Vina. Let me tell you a little bit more about some of these exciting developments. From a bookings perspective, we believe customers across our target markets are embracing our unified platform and the power of our clinical integration, intelligent workflow engine and best-in-class voice, messaging and alerting solutions. We achieved our largest ever number of million dollar win this quarter demonstrating the value of our technology with both new and existing customers. In the US commercial health care market, the highlight was a $2.2 million win at the University of Texas Southwest. UT Southwest bought our full solution, and will leverage Smartbadges for communication, as well as for receiving nurse call and patient monitoring alerts. At Fairview Health, we sold a large $1.1 million engage cross sell, building meaningfully on an existing voice installations. The completeness of our solution and our compelling vision were paramount to both of these wins. Device shipments reached record levels, and we saw uptick of Smartbadges in several of our large commercial new hospital system wins. In our federal business in Q3, we continued to achieve strong results. The highlight of our quarter in the Fed was four wins in the VA each over $1 million. We also had several smaller strategic deals in the VA, including some expansions, and cross sell and demonstrating the value of our install base opportunity. In total, we set another record for Federal bookings in the quarter and year to date. Our Fed team continues to build momentum by leveraging our strong track record in the VA and our authority to operate and stay top purchasing vehicle with the DoD. Moving on to our performance in our international markets, I'm pleased to say we had two large strategic wins. First, we won a $1.5 million deal at Cleveland Clinic, London. Opening in 2021 and setting the standard for world class private healthcare, Cleveland Clinic selected our full solution and plans to deploy our software across a mixed device environment showcasing Smartbadges and the Vina smartphone app. Second, we won a $1.5 million deal at Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City in the United Arab Emirates. Similar to Cleveland Clinic, London, SSMC purchased our full solution including Smartbadges, and is anticipated to be a landmark facility, setting the standard of care for the rest of the region. These exciting wins are powerful statements in their respective regions. International is a large opportunity and a top priority for us and we are pleased to have a growing overseas pipeline. We had a busy Q3 for customer deployments and I'd like to take a moment to tell you about a few installations. Our installations at the University of Virginia is up and running. By November they plan to replace 2,800 pagers with a mix of devices including Smartbadges to connect employees throughout the health system. Another important deployment was in Milwaukee, where freighters expanded their use of our products by going live with engage across four hospitals. Demonstrating the benefit Vocera brings to smaller hospitals. We deployed at the 25 bed Samaritan Pacific Community Hospital in Oregon. Samaritan is replacing pagers and wireless phones to speed urgent notifications and improve that turnover. As our expertise and experience and professional services continues to grow, we believe it is becoming meaningful differentiator and helping our customers choose us as their partner. And finally, deployments at Nordstrom stores across the country continue and includes a brand new New York Tower which opens today. Nordstrom team members were impressed by the Vocera enabled connected fitting room. Nordstrom guests can use iPad to connect to team members on their Vocera Badge and receive immediate feedback that service is on the way. It has been a busy year for us in terms of product innovation and advancements. In Q3, we successfully launched Vina an exciting new smartphone app with an industry leading patient centered approach. Vina presents call, secure messages and alerts in a unified and prioritized inbox and provides an intuitive user experience for clinicians inside and outside the hospital. Vina is designed to deliver relevant context about clinical events, patient status, and clinician availability, helping care teams improve safety, quality of care and experience for patients and care teams. Also during Q3, we introduced the next generation of Vocera Analytics to our customers. Vocera Analytics is a core element of our platform. It is a monitoring and diagnostic tool that provides visibility and insights on all traffic that goes through the Vocera platform. It can help our customers optimize their use of our technology, demonstrate ROI and proactively identify and take action to fix infrastructure issues. Analytics is something that I'm very excited about and we're just getting started in this area. We also launched a new version of the Vocera Care Experience in Q3. This entirely cloud based SaaS offering includes the next generation of our routing software, and our post discharge patient communication platform called Care Inform. Both of these modules are now closely integrated with the rest of our platform. Late in August, we published a report about Hackensack reintroduce of Care Inform to reduce readmit rates amongst stroke patients by 50%. I'd like to thank our teams for this fast pace of product innovation. We have extended our leadership in the market and significantly enhanced our customers' ability to improve patient safety. Also, applications like both Vocera Care Experience and Analytics represents software growth opportunities, and provide new avenues to extend our reach into hospitals and health systems. Moving forward, we are continuing to look for ways to expand our offering across the care continuum by building buying or partnering to enable frictionless patient journeys. Now I'd like to talk about the market and share what we're hearing our conversations with customers. This month we convene two important customer facing meetings. Our large customer advisory board is an annual gathering of almost 50 customer champions. This direct customer engagement provides us with the opportunity to understand our customers' most pressing needs and helps us continue to develop and deliver innovation to improve efficiency, lower cost, and enhance patient experience and staff resiliency. We also held the Humanized Health Summit, a two day forum in San Francisco, which was attended by leaders from some of the nation's top healthcare systems. We felt powerful to witness these leaders collaborate around the pressing issues they face today. Patient safety and staff resiliency are paramount in their quest to achieve quality outcome. Out in the field, my sales conversations and interactions with hospital executives continue to underscore that improving margins, staff safety and quality of care consistently rise to the top of their priority list. Hospitals are looking for ways to reduce costs and improve throughput by eliminating friction and bottlenecks and streamlining operations. From a competitive perspective, I believe our differentiated leadership position continues to grow. Our high win rate demonstrates that our technology continues to be chosen as the best, most complete solution available on the market today. Before, I turn the call over to Justin to discuss our financials, I want to take a moment to provide some insights to how we are viewing our progress so far this year. While we believe hospital investment priorities remain squarely aligned with the value proposition that we deliver to our customers, we continue to face certain challenges associated with large enterprise selling and are making investments to mitigate these dynamics to the best of our ability. Based on our Q3 bookings performance, it's clear that some of these initiatives are starting to pay off. But overall, bookings were not as strong as we would have expected. For instance, we experienced some softness in smaller department level bookings. We believe budgets are consolidating. And some smaller deals are becoming large deals. Increasing our average deal size, but also lengthening sales cycles. And while our international business showed progress with a couple significant wins, we believe we still have work to do to ensure consistent momentum across the geographies. Finally, we are encouraged by the Smartbadge wins we booked this quarter, and we believe that device is well priced and positioned. However, the new device represents more of a paradigm shift for our existing customers than we are initially anticipated, because of its new enhanced software functionality. As a result, it's taking longer than we expected for existing customers to evaluate the Smartbadge. As we enter Q4, and begin to think about 2020, our focus will be on closing wins from our large deal pipeline, building international momentum, and continuing to execute on the Smartbadge transition. As we execute through these markets, and product transitions, we expect our revenue growth over the next few quarters to be consistent with the last couple of quarters. However, we remain confident that business over the longer term, bolstered by strategic customer wins, successful large scale deployments, enthusiasm around our products, and high customer loyalty. With that as context I'd like to give our CFO Justin a chance to cover the financial details around our Q3 results and then we will discuss our guidance. Justin? Justin Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone. We had a solid third quarter for both revenue and profitability, reflecting the continued momentum and pattern we typically see in the second half of the year. Total revenue in Q3 grew 6% to $50.8 million with balanced growth across both our products and services segments. Our device revenue of $19 million increased 12% from prior year, a record for Vocera and was fueled by shipments of both the Badge and Smartbadge. As expected Smartbadge shipments increased from last quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by the pipeline for this device. We anticipate that the Smartbadge mix will continue to increase over the next several quarters, as customers see how this new device demonstrates the full power of our software platform. Meanwhile, the Vocera Badge continues to have strong appeal in the month. Sales of this device were robust in Q3 driven by our Federal business Nordstrom and other key customers. Software revenue was $9.5 million compared to $10.3 million in the same period last year. As we look forward over the next few quarters, we believe our software business will return to robust growth. There is high software content in several of the large deals we booked in Q3 that we expect to ship in the coming months. And the newer products that Brent mentioned earlier, including the Smartbadge and our new Vina mobile app should drive higher software sales, a key driver of our long term operating model. Our software maintenance and support revenue, which provides a solid economic foundation for our business grew 9% in Q3 compared to the same period last year. Our revenue pattern for software maintenance and support revenue is predictable because it is recurring and is recognized over an extended period of time. Also fueling this with our high maintenance renewal rate, which continues to be well in excess of 95%, reflecting the benefits our customers experience from using our products. Professional services of revenue of $4.7 million was up 6% compared to last year. We had a healthy professional services backlog and continued to innovate in this area via both product enhancements and process refinements to achieve the best outcome for our customers in terms of costs, and experience. Lastly, our combined backlog and deferred revenue increased to roughly $122 million in Q3, up from $117 million in the third quarter of last year. This was also up sequentially from Q2 and we expect to increase this further in Q4 following our normal pattern and building backlog and deferred revenue in the second half of the year. On the profitability side, our adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $9.5 million in Q3. At 19% of total revenue our Q3 adjusted EBITDA reflects the strong leverage we have in our financial model as we grow and we achieved positive GAAP net income in the quarter, a key milestone in our profitability journey. Now, let me get into some more detail on our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 66%, improving sequentially from the first half. The decrease in product margin compared to last year is primarily driven by lower relative software mix in Q3, which can happen from time to time given our software revenue model. Our gross margins in both devices and software continue to be healthy, reflecting our differentiation in the market. Non-GAAP services margin was again strong at 56%, primarily reflecting the continued growth of our recurring software maintenance and support revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $24.9 million were flat compared to last year. The investments we've made over the last years to enhance our scalability have enabled us to keep our operating expense growth in check, while continuing to invest meaningfully in areas that we believe will drive long term growth, such as R&D and sales initiatives. As a result, we continue to believe that there is more opportunity to drive operating leverage as we grow. To cap off my Q3 commentary, we continue to have a strong balance sheet with roughly $221 million in cash and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities. Now turning to guidance. As Brent mentioned, we saw a lot of progress in Q3 in our strategic initiatives. We're encouraged by this and we are confident our market position continues to be strong. But with one quarter remaining in the year, our growth is not where we had hoped it would be. Reflecting this, our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter is $46 million to $51 million. Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $5 million and $9 million and GAAP net loss per share between $0.15 and $0.02. The implied revenue guidance for the full year is $176 million to $181.8 million. The rest of the guidance details along with a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance can be found in the guidance table of our press release. Wrapping up despite this near term transition, we remain confident in our growth potential longer term, including the strength of our customer base, our market leadership position and the potential of our new products. Meanwhile, we are managing our expenses so that we can continue to deliver profitability and invest in areas that we expect will fuel our long term growth. I'll now turn the call back to Brent, Brent Lang : Thanks Justin. With Q3 behind us, we are focused on execution and closing out a strong year. As we think about next year, while our growth may remain moderate in the near term, we are confident we are taking the right steps to secure long term growth. We will continue to invest in international work to ensure a smooth Smartbadge transition and continue to enhance our sales process in order to harvest or large deal pipeline and bring in new customer wins and expansions. It's still early days in the evolution of hospital communications away from pagers, loud speakers and wireless phones. Our differentiated technology and our large Greenfield opportunity inspire us to pursue the goals we set out to achieve. Namely to transform healthcare and make a lasting difference for patients and caregivers. This thesis remains unchanged and we remain confident about the Future. With that, we're ready to conclude our formal remarks. Thank you for listening today. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from line of a Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Ryan Daniels : Yes, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Obviously, the key focus will be on Q4 sales and the flat year-over-year growth versus the expectation for stronger performance. I'm curious if you can go into a bit more detail on the impact of each of the three things you outline. Meaning, how much of this do you believe is due to an extended sale cycle? How much due to some the International noise and weakness? And then how much on existing clients taking longer to assess and install or purchase the new badge? If you can break that down that would be helpful. Brent Lang : Sure, Ryan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think that's certainly the most important one is this transition we're seeing in the market between departmental level buying and enterprise level buying. We're seeing a larger increasing number of bigger deals and fewer and fewer decisions that are being driven at departmental level. This is having a positive impact in terms of average deal size, but in many cases is adding complexity as these deals need to go through additional approval cycles and building consensus across the organization. International, the second one that you referenced and I also referenced in my remarks is more a function of bringing consistency. We feel like we actually had a really strong Q3 and we're looking forward to some of the deals for the remainder of this year and into next year. But if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, it's certainly below where we had wanted it to be. I think in that case, it's more question of us continuing to do the work, that we've already begun to do more sales enablement, more marketing support, some leadership changes that we've made internationally to have an opportunity to get their teams in place. The pipeline is there internationally, and the -- our competitive differentiation, and our offering seems to be resonating really well. So it's really more a matter of bringing more consistency to that part of the business. And in the case of Smartbadge, I think this is actually a net-net positive for us over the longer term, what we realized is that what we did off with the introduction of the Smartbadge was truly an industry changing activity and while there remains a lot of excitement around it we're recognizing that customers are having to rethink their strategy around clinical integration, around messaging, around software platform and even the infrastructure around silly things like their chargers, batteries, training, some of the infrastructure. So particularly within the install base, I think that that is a bigger impact. So if I was going to rank order them, I probably would say the transition in the deal sizes is overriding the biggest element of it; Smartbadge would be second; and I think international would be third. But we view all them as sort of temporary issues that over the longer term, we feel like either the market will self-correct or we will be able to execute and fix on our own. And actually lead towards more bullishness in the business on a longer term basis. Ryan Daniels : Okay, that makes sense. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Guggenheim Securities. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just want to talk about that longer sales cycle in a little more detail. And as we've seen these deals transition to the larger sizes, is it mostly the administrative process. The approval process that's causing them to take longer or is there anything to call out with respect to budget pressure or the competitive landscape that is causing these deals to take longer to close? Brent Lang : Yes, good question. I would characterize it primarily on the administrative side. And if I break down the sales process and just sort of to have there's a portion on the front end, which is the evaluation of the product, getting to what we think of as vendor of choice, and the reason that that's extended in the sales process is because the number of interested parties and decision makers that want to have a say in that decision increases a lot when you go to these house wide deals. So each department had the CMIO, the CMO, the CNO, the CIO, all these people want to be involved in that decision making and evaluation process. And so it's more of a calendaring and administrative issue just to get demos completed for those folks. We're not seeing any kind of competitive impact on that, it's really just a matter of building consensus amongst the organizations. The second half is sort of post vendor of choice selection to purchase order. And that is where we're seeing probably an even longer elongation as these organizations that have gone through, in many cases, mergers with other health systems or structural changes within their own internal administrative bodies are trying to navigate what's required in order to get from vendor choice to purchase order. And that can involve statements of work the other legal aspects of it. It can involve the funding mechanisms. It can even involve just simple operations in day-to-day activities getting in the way of getting into final paperwork close. When you're talking about over $1 million size deals, there is just more hands in that. And I think probably that's the piece that we're seeing more elongation where we've been named vendor of choice. But in order to get approvals for $1 million plus or $2 million plus or larger deal, it's oftentimes having to go through several additional committees for final approval up to including at the board level approvals. And obviously the board meetings only occurred on a sporadic basis and so in some cases we're bound by the calendar. I would tell you that we're not seeing any change in terms of competitive front. Our win rate remains very, very high customer level of excitement for our solution remains very, very high. We're just not losing deals in that context. It's really more of that time from vendor of choice into to PO and then ultimately to deployment. It's taking longer than the smaller deals with that. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay, great. And maybe just as a quick follow up. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and to 2020. Can you just give us some comments on what you're seeing in terms of RFP volume and the pipeline right now, relative to what you saw this time last year? Thanks. Brent Lang : I would say both are up substantially. The pipeline right now, in particular our marginal pipeline is larger than it's ever been before and I think that's what gets us excited about the future. More and more of this business is going to RFP and I think that's the reflection of the fact that this is not a one off initiative by an individual inside of the department. But it's more of a strategic evaluation and initiative that's being managed and funded at the C3 level of the health system. And typically, in that environment, they're going to go through more of a formal RFP process. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of David Windley from Jeffries. David Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. I joined a little late. So I apologize if my context on this is a little off. But in our notes at the top of your comments you talk about I think eight deals over $1 million. Relative to your answer to last question are those deals where you're describing that you've gotten the vendor of choice not or whether actually progressing the bookings? Brent Lang : So those are all formal bookings. We don't typically talk about deals until we received an actual booking from the customer. And that's a very disciplined approach that we take where the firm commitment to buy in the form of a purchase order. And so anything that is in that kind of vendor of choice to booking category is something that still in process and we wouldn't talk about on a call like this. David Windley : Okay. And so make sure I'm clear on terminology. So, I think you also talked about in terms of sales force, attention and deployment that 80% are focused on new deals 20% focused on upsell. In light of lengthening cycle time, would it make sense to have more of your selling effort focused on kind of existing clients and moving, say already friendly clients up the consumption continuum, rather than having to break into somebody new where the cycle time to ultimate revenue is less known? Brent Lang : Yes, directionally. I agree with what you're saying. I would correct the notion that 80% of sales force is focused on new deals. I think maybe, maybe we've said that its 80% of the effort or something. But in terms of the actual sales force deployment, the vast majority of them have a mixed bag of both install base of customers as well as new customers that they're targeting. And in fact, there's chunks of the sales organization that's focused on either maintenance renewals or on our supplies business and then there's a number that are focused on those existing customers as well. One thing that I would highlight to support your point, actually is that, I believe four of those $8 million deals, were in fact expansion deals. So you're absolutely right, the strategy, even when these larger over $1 million deals is to work with the install base, either in cross selling, engage or expanding into new groups of users or new departments and we've had good success in that environment. David Windley : And then, last question, again sorry if you discuss this in detail. But last quarter, and when we were together during the quarter, you talked in some granular detail about two very large deals that had pushed out of the quarter for reasons that seemed very achievable, eminently achievable during the third quarter. Did those land in the third quarter or have they still been pushed out further? Brent Lang : Yes, I don't think we want to get into the specifics of individual deals. But I would tell you we are feeling very good about that process. The analogy that I've used before is kind of the planes circling here, each landing individually. And, it's the actual the arrival time that someone is up in the air on some of them. None of those deals have disappeared. I think, all the ones that we were talking about in the Q2 timeframe of now close. But the more relevant point is that we need to have more airplanes in the air and more arrivals at any given point in time. And none of the ones we were talking about went away. I think they've all looked at this point in time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor from Baird. Please go ahead. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, thanks for the question. Following up on the elongation of the sales process. Sounds like that's driven by a combination of both larger deals, and then maybe some additional consideration around Smartbadges and folks trying to understand how that'll best fit within their strategy. Can you give us any sense for where you think you are in this process of the -- it seems like the elongation has gotten longer and longer and longer? Are you seeing any evidence that we're at a nadir, or at a trough I should say? And then how are you kind of factoring this into guidance? Can you just give us any sense along those lines? Brent Lang : Yes, so thanks for the question. I think the way I would characterize it is it's not that the large deal sales itself is getting that much longer, but more of the deals are in that large deal sales cycles. So as we move, if you move to a dozen deals from a department level deal to these enterprise deals. And each of those transitions representative change from, a 9 months sales cycle to an 18 months sales cycle, then you're going to have this natural value during that transition period of time. And I think what's happening to our business is that more and more of it is moving into that that category of the larger enterprise deals. Yes, there are some factors that even on the enterprise deal, because of the dynamics in the market are being elongated. But I think the bigger dynamic for us is just the number of deals that are falling into that larger deal category. I think, we're getting closer to the point of reaching a steady state, although the challenge is just understanding the specific timeframe associated with those. And I think part of the reason why we're being more conservative with guidance, and I'll let Justin speak to this as well is that we just are recognizing that there's a natural lumpiness in the business as we as we navigate these larger transactions. Justin Spencer : Yes. And as we look forward here over the next few quarters, I think this is clearly a dynamic that we've tried to factor into our overall guidance. What we're seeing is, we see a robust pipeline of large deals. We're definitely seeing a clear shift, purchasing from a departmental level to these larger deals. And so in terms of our expectations over the next few quarters while we work through this is, we've moderated our growth assumptions. But in long term, we think this is a real net positive because the larger deals have inherently larger deal sizes, and there's a much larger annuity stream that comes with those, which we think will add even more stability to our business model over the long run. Matthew Gillmor : And maybe one follow up. Can you -- if you can just quantify sort of how large some of these very large deals are just to give us some sense for the opportunity that's ahead? Justin Spencer : Yes, we have a fairly kind of simplistic artificial cut off of anything over $1 million is what we call a large deal. And as Brent mentioned earlier, they can fit either with as, as an existing customer who is expanding to a new hospital or even within a hospital across multiple products or a brand new customer who is purchasing the solution on an enterprise level across the entire health system. We have deal in our pipeline that are in that large scale category that range from that $1 million and up to several million dollars. And when you get into the larger health systems, there the opportunities are in the multimillion dollar levels. Matthew Gillmor : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Sean Wieland : Hi, thanks. So given all this, have you updated how you're calculating your guidance, your third quarter-to-quarter guidance or predicting the deal closure cycles in any way can you share that with us? Brent Lang : Yes, good. Hi, Sean. For the current quarter, we've applied a very consistent framework for how we calculate our guidance and our guidance relative to our results then quite strong in terms of forecasting revenue in the current quarter. And so we start with our backlog and our deferred revenue, we end the visibility that we expect from that in our suppliers and the remainder is the amount of book ship. When we're estimating the amount of books shift that we expect to close in the quarter. We look at the size of pipeline relative to our bookings targets and calibrate from there. Well, we are saying the reason we chosen to provide a little bit longer term view here, or I should say view as moderated growth over the next few quarters is to just make sure that expectations are in line with this transition that we're going through as we transition our bookings pattern from more departmental purchasing to larger deal sizes and in February will come out with formal 2020 guidance at that point. Sean Wieland : So you've used the word moderate, a few times in describing your outlook, which I'm not quite sure what that means and is moderate going to be above zero. And can you comment on 2020, we should be expecting 2020 to be a flat year or now what is moderate need in your view? Brent Lang : So the language that I have tried to highlight in my portion of the script was that we expect growth to be similar to what we've seen in the last couple quarters as we look into the next couple of quarters. So it's clearly not zero. It's not down. But it's also not in the mid-teens range that we've talked about, historically. Sean Wieland : All right. And then one last quick one. How did the Fed business do relative to your expectations in the corner? Brent Lang : It was right on track. I think we were really pleased. Obviously Q3 is always a big quarter for the Fed, and they delivered as expected. So we were really happy with how that played out. Sean Wieland : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gene Mannheimer from Dougherty and Company. Gene Mannheimer : Thanks, good afternoon. I don't want to be a dead horse here. But I want to do just kind of go back to the increasing complexity of the sales as they get larger. Do you feel do you have the right structure and alignment in place to meet the complexity of these longer sales cycles and decision processes? For example, do you need a more consultative push, do you need more product and domain expertise, do you need to more of a hunter farmer model? I'm just trying to get a handle on and if you're thinking about those things? Brent Lang : Thanks, Gene. Yes, spending a lot of time thinking about those things. And generally feel like we're in a work in progress on that. Clearly, there's been a transition in our sales organization, as we've had to migrate from the more department oriented deals to the larger deals. And that's been in the form of the tools and sales enablement aspects is coming in the form of who we're marketing to and how we're marketing on those. But it's also come in the context of the skill set and capabilities and structure of sales force itself. I would characterize 2019 as a year where we've been more aggressive in changing the makeup and structure of the sales team, where we found certain individuals who were just not able to make the transition to the more enterprise level selling. They may have been very successful, and it was more of a departmental or more of a device sale and so we've been very proactive in making those transitions. And we've got a number of new folks who come in and we believe, have more of that enterprise selling capability. And then the enabling tools that we give them, whether that's the account planning, whether that's the ROI sales tools, whether that's the clinical executive teams, the nurses that support those clinical workflows, or the technical expertise to be able to support the questions around scalability around security, more of the enterprise class questions, it becomes much more of a team based selling. And so well, I think we've made tremendous progress on that. I don't think we're done. I think there's more work to be done there and we continue to evolve, as we move forward on that some of this is learning on our part and some of it's actually also learning on the part of our customers, where they're making decisions that they may not have been exposed to before and they're having to navigate the organizational structure of their own organizations. And so I think we're, we're taking it very seriously and I would say we're on the right path, but we're not done. Gene Mannheimer : Well, thought out. Thanks for that, Brent. And then my other question would be, I guess, about longer term growth, you've discussed that in the near term revenue growth is going to be more muted. But when you talk about the long term resumption of growth, how long term is that and will we be looking at a double digit type of trajectory past next year? Brent Lang : I remain really excited about the long term growth prospects of this business. I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think our product solution set right now is better than it's ever been. We remain really excited about the Greenfield opportunity in this business. We still think we're in the early innings here. And so I don't see any reason why we couldn't get back up to that kind of growth level in the future. We see these product and market transitions as temporary. And my expectation is that at some point in the future, we could get back to the higher growth rates that we've experienced in the past. As you know both Justin and I try to be as absolutely transparent as possible about the business and like we see it and we felt like we wanted to be transparent at this point, but also want to make it absolutely clear that we remain very bullish on the long term prospects. And see a market that we're reminded every day is still made up of hospitals that have got bunch of pagers, and in building wireless phones and overhead loudspeakers that are just not getting the job done. And the number of hospitals that continue to come to us and just tell us what an incredible difference our products are making in their environment as they navigate away from these legacy solutions. Particularly in times of stress or particular difficult times during nursing strikes or other challenging environments, the value that our product suite can bring into the environment, both in terms of patient safety, as well as in terms of staff resiliency and quality outcome continues to make it a very, very powerful and compelling solution. So I think our long term prospects are being very positive. Gene Mannheimer : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Lucas Baranowski : Yes, this is Lucas Baranowski on for Matt Hewitt here at Craig Hallum. Just a couple of questions here. You've talked in the past about the potential for the Smartbadge to drive higher attach rate for engage in some of the software offerings. Now that some of those larger Smartbadge wins have started to come in, has that been the trend that you're seeing? Brent Lang : Yes, absolutely. In fact, several of the deals that I talked about on the call, which were newer customer deployments, they were buying Smartbadges and they are also buying voice messaging and engage clinical integration. So the mix of devices across Smartbadges and smartphones and then the full suite of software is becoming the norm in most of our new customer wins. I would say it's taking longer and what I was trying to allude to in the call was that it's really the existing customers that are taking more time to do the evaluation because they have a lot of inertia tied to historically of doing things with our previous version of the Badge. But in particularly for the new customer wins, we're seeing the Smartbadge be a real driver of selling this full stack of our software and including engage in messaging. Lucas Baranowski : Okay, great. And then turning to the Nordstrom rollout, I believe a large portion of that occurred during the quarter. How much of that is left to occur in Q4? Justin Spencer : We reshipped and delivered all of the product, the Badges and the software. The professional services work is ongoing. We're through a meaningful number of stores but there are a few that remain which will be completed by the end of the year. That's gone really well. As Brent mentioned earlier, the new merchant store in New York, just open today and is prominently showing the demonstration of our technology in the store. We're really encouraged by how that deployment is gone. Lucas Baranowski : Okay, thank you very much. That's all I had. Operator : And our next question comes from a line of Mike Oth [ph] from Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With a few weeks of 4Q underway here curious how you're seeing the hospital spending environment in general as we head into 2020. And are you seeing any political headwinds at all? Brent Lang : No, I don't think we've seen any changes at all. I think we're feeling good about Q4 and so far, the issues of staff resiliency and patient safety and quality of care seem to be immune from the DC belt [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : That's great to hear. And congrats on the $2 million plus international deals. I realized one was in the UK, but Brexit issues there seem to be heating up more recently. Curious if that has led to any impact on your business? Brent Lang : I think it's too early to know. But with something we're certainly watching, the nice thing about the Cleveland Clinic London deal is that it's a private hospital. So it's not subjected to the same sort of funding mechanisms that the NHS deals would be. And I think in the short term, we probably would prioritize opportunities with the private hospitals in the UK over some of the NHS opportunities. But the team in the UK is actually building good momentum. Some of you may remember we moved one of our star employees over to the UK to manage that organization. And he has done a really nice job of building momentum, both within the install base as well as building pipeline. And I'm actually going to be over there next month meeting with customers, meeting with the team and also meeting with some investors and looking forward to getting on the ground and seeing the dynamic there. But the beautiful thing about the Cleveland Clinic in London is it's going to provide a tremendous lighthouse account for us because other thought leaders in the country will clearly be looking to Cleveland Clinic as they think about their own communication needs. And we think it will become a great showcase account for us as we grow that region. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Great. And your last question for the evening is from the line Stephanie Demko from Citi. Stephanie Demko : Thank you, guys. Given the elongation of new client sales, how much room that you have left in the -- across the opportunity? And as a follow up to that is there anything you can do like reshuffling the sales force that could accelerate this just to kind of offset the slowing growth in other channels? Brent Lang : Yes. Great thought Stephanie. In fact, we see a tremendous opportunity remaining for cross sell into our install base. The number of our legacy voice customers who are not using engage is still very, very high. And that could be not just a small cross sell, but in many cases can be a very large dollar amount in those cross sells. And some of the other legacy middleware players in the space are faltering right now. And so we see it as an opportunity to go back in and cross sell our solution into the install base there. There's also an opportunity to cross sell messaging. And obviously as we continue to roll out Smartbadge, we see that as an upgrade opportunity as well. So clearly sales force is balancing between new customer opportunities and install base, but we see the install base opportunity as a great growth driver as well. Stephanie Demko : Will you have any pushback on the kind of cross sells or elongations there what causes this, given we haven't seen the rapid adoption yet, they kind of seem like a -- given is it they already have a competitor solution or is it just they're not ready for adoption? Brent Lang : So the biggest issue is that they already have our solution. And I say somewhat ironically. But if you go to a customer that's invested millions of dollars into the B3000 and/or B3000 form factor or even B2000 form factor, that form factor was largely compatible with each other. It has the same battery. It uses the same charger. It uses the same accessories. The functionality and the user interface of the device was the same. So it didn't require any additional training. And with some of our larger install base customers who we rely on for large Badge refreshes on a fairly regular basis, they're looking at it and they're saying, there's a lot of inertia associated with the prior form factor for them to make the move to Smartbadge. It requires them to think about everything from batteries and chargers to training and rollout. But more significantly, it has been thinking about the change in their workflow because they've primarily been using pure voice workflows for most of their use of the Vocera. With the Smartbadges, they now can start thinking about in engage in some of these other pieces. And while that's a great opportunity, it's a more complex decision than simply saying, I'm going to swap out, 500 B3000n Badges for 500 Smartbadges because of some of those other infrastructure elements that I mentioned. Stephanie Demko : Alright. Understood. Thank you. Good day guys. Brent Lang : Thanks, Stephanie. Okay, well, thank you very much for your time today. We look forward to speaking with all of you in the future and have a good evening. All the best. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Sue Dooley of Vocera, Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sue Dooley : Thank you. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Vocera's conference call to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings. Joining me today are our CEO, Brent Lang; and Justin Spencer, our CFO. Earlier this afternoon, we distributed a press release detailing our quarterly results. The release is posted on our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the Investor Relations page of our website where a replay will be archived. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward-looking information is subject to risks and uncertainties described in Vocera's filings with the SEC, and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On this call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release.  With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll start by summarizing the highlights from the fourth quarter and the full year. Then I'll provide some details on key customer wins and some specifics on bookings in each area of our business. I'll conclude my prepared remarks with commentary on the market environment and our priorities for 2020 before turning the call over to Justin for more details on our financials. The fourth quarter of 2019 was a great quarter for Vocera from a bookings perspective, and I'm very proud of our team's performance as we finished out the year. We ended the year on a strong note. With substantial year-over-year bookings growth in Q4, setting a record for quarterly bookings and building a significant amount of backlog that will provide much better revenue visibility for 2020.  For the year, we drove bookings growth of 10% compared to 2018, and continued to trend towards large new customer wins and sizable expansions, demonstrating both the continued high win rate and the value our existing customers see in our solutions. Revenue was roughly $50 million in Q4 in line with our expectations and resulted in revenues of nearly $181 million for the full year. While annual revenue growth was not what we originally hoped, 2019 was a year of great accomplishments for us, and I believe the strategic bets we have placed will be important to our long-term success. I'm proud that we finished the year strong and won several large enterprise accounts and significant expansions. 2019 was a record for the number of large customer wins and we added a significant number of new health care customers, a strong leading indicator of future growth potential.  We also made significant progress with our large customer deployments and maintain a very high customer satisfaction as reflected by both our maintenance renewals and customer surveys. The completeness of our solution remains a differentiator for us, and we continue to succeed against competitors with a high win rate. Customer demand for communication and collaboration solutions drove our business this year, and we continue to see strong levels of RFP activity. 2019 was a year of important transitions in our business and our pace of innovation is paying off, advancing our leadership in this space. As we begin 2020, I'm excited by our large market opportunity, the increasing differentiation of our unified solution and our pipeline of business.  Now I'd like to provide you with some more detail on our bookings performance in Q4. We had outstanding new system wins at Norton Health for $7.4 million and at the University of Chicago for $1.8 million. Norton Health based in Louisville, Kentucky will be rolling out our complete solution across their entire health system. This deal represents the second largest commercial win in the history of the company. University of Chicago was already a customer for our Care Experience product. And in Q4, after an extensive RFP process, they awarded Vocera the business for their entire communications suite.  Our team delivered large expansion orders for our solution from existing customers. We booked a $2.7 million cross-sell at UCLA who had previously only been an engaged customer and now has purchased our full software platform, including the new Vina smartphone app to replace an aging pager solution. Houston Methodist, a great land and expand example for us, is leveraging our software with a $2.4 million smartphone booking. Houston Methodist is a great mixed device case study, showcasing the variety of devices that seamlessly operate with our software. We won a $1.2 million expansion at Vassar Brothers Medical Center, which included the rollout of Engage as well as several hundred Smartbadges. We had $1.2 million in bookings at Kaiser and $1.1 million in bookings at Intermountain, both are existing customers who continue to build out their Vocera capabilities.  In our federal business, we continued to achieve solid results in Q4. For the year, we set another record for federal bookings, and our team continues to build momentum by leveraging our strong track record in the VA and our authority to operate and SATOC purchasing vehicle with the DoD. Moving on to our performance in our international markets. We were pleased to book 2 sizable new facility wins for our Smartbadge in the Middle East. Building on our relationship with the Ministry of Health in the UAE, we won at Al Qassimi Women's and Children's hospital. And in our first win in the Kingdom of Bahrain, we were selected by the newly built and largest cardiac center there. While we had several meaningful wins in international markets in 2019, we continue to invest in the sales team and marketing support with the goal of building on this momentum across all the regions in 2020. International is a large opportunity and continues to be a top priority for us.  Outside of healthcare, rollout at Nordstrom are now complete for the initial order that we booked last year. In Q4, we had a new booking, which included a distribution center. Nordstrom is being quite creative in their use of our solution to generate efficiencies and enhance the shopping experience. The connected fitting room is a hit, and we believe there are opportunities for more workflows and future orders. Finally, we added another 4 season facility this time in Madrid.  Now I'd like to make 2 final comments about our progress in 2019 : first, we've largely completed the transformation of our sales force to address today's market opportunity. These investments and changes were necessary to be successful in this evolving market where decision-making is being consolidated and enterprise selling is essential. We felt the changes were justified by the opportunity, and we see them starting to pay off. Today's trend towards larger deals benefits us. While this transition can present challenging selling dynamics, we're constantly striving to enhance our enterprise selling capabilities. I feel good about where we are today. We have several new sales leaders and territory reps that bring substantial experience in enterprise selling, and I'm confident that we are well positioned to capture this market opportunity.  On the product front, we introduced new products that stretch the thinking of both the market and our customers. Meanwhile, we distance ourselves from our competitors. Our Smartbadge device and Vina smartphone app are game changers, redefining their categories, winning innovation awards, demonstrating our vision and further extending our market leadership. Engage software remains the mainstay of our conversations with customers and an important part of our deal mix, demonstrating important clinical results. For example, Augusta Health recently implemented our solution as part of its effort to reduce sepsis-related risks. With Vocera, they saw a significant reduction in sepsis-related fatalities and are now at a rate that is less than half the state benchmark. With what we believe are the best products in the market and a revamped sales team, we continue to convert our large deal pipeline to Vendor of Choice awards and eventually bookings, and our win rates remain high. Now I'd like to talk for a moment about the market for our solutions and share what we're hearing in our conversations with customers. It feels like the level of interest and amount of discussion around communication and clinical workflow solutions is higher than it has ever been. Out in the field, my sales conversations and interactions with hospital executives continue to underscore that improving margins, staff safety and quality of care consistently rise to the top of their priority list. And there seems to be a growing awareness of the role that communication solutions can have on improving these outcomes. Of course, spending in healthcare always requires rigorous justification, as we begin 2020, hospitals are looking for ways to reduce costs and improve throughput by eliminating friction in bottlenecks and streamlining operations. In a recent op ed, NewYork-Presbyterian's Chief Experience Officer, Rick Evans, spoke about the criticality of transforming the present's journey by connecting technology and communication from beginning to end. He also set as a goal for a 0 harm culture for both patients and hospital staff. These C-suite priorities play right into our value proposition and staff safety is a particularly compelling aspect of our HIMSS presence this year.  Our complete solution combining real-time voice, secure texting and deep clinical integration is effectively addressing these opportunities. The industry is taking note that Vocera is a great partner based on our high quality services, the breadth of our solution and our increasing number of integrations. For example, a new integration with the [indiscernible] is now being showcased in [indiscernible] customer experience center. And with the recent addition of the Spectralink Versity smartphone, we have the most comprehensive and unique portfolio of mobile devices for healthcare, all of which seamlessly operate with our software.  Based on the strategic moves we made in 2019 around products and sales initiatives, we believe we are well positioned for 2020. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a couple of our key priorities for the coming year : first, we'll work to expand and harvest our large deal pipeline and made continued progress in enterprise deals; we'll also expand our presence in the federal market by adding new facilities and successfully cross-selling our solution; we'll continue to drive expansion as our customers look to standardize on communications platforms and broaden the ROI benefits; and finally, we will work to extend our international success. Thanks to our investments in increasing marketing support, new sales resources and new country leadership. Our continued focus will be on sales execution. We'll continue to develop our teams, hone the deal closure process and work on our recent success with large academic medical centers like UVA, University of Chicago, UCLA and Northwestern, who represent great examples for their peers to emulate.  We plan to continue to invest in product innovation to extend our clinical relevance, both within and outside the 4 walls of the hospital. We are bringing to life our vision of consolidating clinical data and delivering actionable information and context to the right Care team member at the right time. We'll also continue our focus of arming our customers with analytics that will describe, diagnose, predict and prescribe the best practices around clinical collaboration and workflow. We also expect to deliver ongoing Smartbadge enhancements, including a wake word \"Hey Vocera\", which recently became available and enables a truly hands-free experience. Our customers will also soon be able to use the wake word to say : \"Hey, Vocera, send a text message.\" triggering an interaction that converts their voice into a text message via their Smartbadge, and of course, we believe our number of integrations and workflows into clinical systems will continue to grow.  Moving forward, we are continuing to look for ways to expand our offering across the healthcare continuum by building, buying or partnering to enable frictionless patient journeys. While healthcare remains our primary focus, we also plan to continue pursuing market opportunities outside of healthcare, in luxury hotels and high-end retail, to name a few areas of recent success. We are investing incrementally in this space by adding a few experienced sales reps, and we intend to capitalize on the opportunities that are out there. While we're on this topic, I'd like to talk about an exciting new initiative in school safety where we now have some active pilots. It's still early for this opportunity but school safety fits well within our overall mission and our team is eagerly exploring the opportunity. We are building relationships to inform, educate school systems navigate funding dynamics and prove our value in what we believe is a pressing and crucial use of our solution.  Overall I'm happy with how we ended the year, and I'm excited by the opportunity that lies in front of us. With that, I'd like to give our CFO, Justin, a chance to cover the financial details around our Q4 results, and then we'll discuss our guidance. Justin? Justin Spencer : Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone. Our Q4 results represented a strong finish to the year and put us in a position to begin 2020 with good momentum. I'll summarize our Q4 results and then turn to guidance for 2020. Total revenue in Q4 grew to $49.7 million fueled primarily by double-digit growth of our device business and continued expansion of our recurring software maintenance revenue. For the full year, total revenue was $180.5 million, up slightly from 2018.  Product revenue in the quarter was $26.9 million similar to last year. Device revenue was robust, growing 15% compared to last year as a result of shipments to several new customers, some large badge refreshes and continued strength of our recurring supplies business. We shipped a record number of badges and Smartbadges in 2019, reflecting the continued appeal of our wearable hands-free devices. Our Q4 device revenue also included a shipment of third-party smartphones to Houston Methodist, who had purchased messaging licenses a few quarters ago. While software revenue was lower in Q4 and 2019, software and software maintenance revenue combined, which we view holistically as our software business, was 55% of total revenue for the full year consistent with the prior year. And we have record software backlog as we begin 2020, which gives us confidence that we'll once again have strong growth in this category. Services revenue in the fourth quarter was $22.7 million, up 5% from last year.  Our professional services revenue was down year-over-year as we have transitioned to a more streamlined implementation process and lower cost for our customers. With a large backlog of deployments already scheduled, we expect professional services to grow again in 2020. And with a larger customer base this year and a renewal rate well above 95%, our software maintenance and support revenue was up again in Q4.  This has been a consistent recurring revenue engine driving our growth and directly reflects the enhanced value and functionality our customers receive from our software. As our software revenue increases again in 2020, our software maintenance growth should also expand accordingly. Now I'd like to comment briefly on our backlog and deferred revenue. This combined balance at the end of the year was $136.3 million, up 13% compared to the end of 2018. This is the most significant increase in a few years and gives us confidence in the long-term health of our business. In the short term, it also enhances our revenue visibility, which I'll touch on a bit more when I discuss guidance. Turning to profitability. In Q4, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $6.9 million. And for the full year, our adjusted EBITDA was $16.9 million. As we look forward to 2020, we expect our profitability to improve again with operating leverage from higher revenue and more software. With that as some context, let me get into some more detail on our non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses, including a comment on what we expect in 2020 for each of these areas.  Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 64%. Product margin decreased from last year, primarily as a result of lower software revenue and the third-party devices we shipped to Houston Methodist. Although the margins we achieved from reselling smartphones are less than those of our own badges, we provide them to customers who are looking to leverage our software with a complete solution from a single vendor. Our services gross margin increased compared to last year as we continued to drive leverage in all parts of that business. As we now look forward, we expect our overall non-GAAP gross margin percentage to increase in 2020. As our software growth returns, and we realize even greater leverage from growth on the fixed cost in our services business. And with our normal pattern of revenue seasonality expected again in 2020, we expect our gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s in Q1 and then improve in the subsequent quarters as revenue increases. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $25.9 million in Q4 similar to last year as we continue to focus our spending on growth. Given the market opportunity we see ahead for us, we are investing to drive long-term growth, particularly in sales and product development. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase this year. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly 58% of revenue with spending at a fairly similar level in each of the 4 quarters.  Now I'd like to make a few comments about our cash flow and balance sheet. We added $9 million of cash to our balance sheet in Q4 as a result of our profitability and working capital management. For the full year, our operating cash flow increased to $15.8 million, and we expect this to be even higher in 2020. Our CapEx is expected to be around $5 million this year or roughly 3% of revenue. Our balance sheet positions us well to capitalize on new growth opportunities.  Turning now to guidance. Brent spoke earlier about the market dynamics we expect this year, and we have touched on the good progress we are making in evolving our sales capability to align with the ongoing changes in the market. The sales reps that we have added in the last 12 months are relatively early in their ramp, but we expect them to contribute to our success this year. Additionally, the higher level of backlog and deferred revenue increases our confidence and provide better visibility to our revenue than we had entering 2019. We expect our revenue seasonality in 2020 to be similar to our historic pattern with roughly 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. With that as background for 2020, we expect revenue to be between $186 million and $196 million. With this annual revenue growth, we also expect to improve profitability. In 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $15.5 million and $20.5 million. In the current year, our profitability will be closely tied to our revenue pattern, so we expect adjusted EBITDA to be the lowest in Q1 and then expand as top line increases through the year, reflecting higher profitability and progress toward our target operating model. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $36 million and $39 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between negative $5 million and negative $2.5 million.  We now look forward to 2020 with a lot of optimism. We continue to see a large opportunity ahead of us and feel we are making the right moves to align the organization and drive long-term growth and enhanced profitability. I'll now turn it back to Brent. Brent Lang : Thanks, Justin. Overall, I believe 2019 was a year of great accomplishment for us. We finished the year strong, and we believe we have made the right strategic bets to address the long-term opportunity. It's still early days in the evolution of hospital communications away from pagers, loudspeakers and wireless phones, the functionality and scalability of our differentiated software platform is unmatched in the marketplace. And our solution provides a compelling value proposition for hospitals of all sizes. We had a great year for large system wins and the large expansions underscore the strategic importance our customers see in our products. Our differentiated technology and our large greenfield opportunity inspire us to pursue the goals we set out to achieve. You may know that 2020 is the Year of the Nurse. And I'd like to take a moment to highlight something really important to me. The \"Why\" that drives our mission at Vocera? Our mission is to transform healthcare by improving the lives of patients and caregivers. We have a long track record of providing nurses with tools to improve resiliency, reduced toil and burnout and return a sense of joy back of their time with patients. I'm proud of our lasting connection with nurses and the broader hospital staff, and we look forward to celebrating the Year of the Nurse. I'd also like to thank our employees who dedicate their talents to developing our solutions extending our reach into the market, delivering thought leadership and contributing to our unique culture. In 2019, Vocera and our employees made meaningful charitable contributions of both time and money to our local communities, deciding together where to donate those dollars and working side-by-side volunteering in our communities.  Finally, before opening up the call for your questions, I'd like to personally invite all of you to our investor breakfast at HIMSS on March 11. Feel free to contact Sue if you have any questions about this event, and please stop by our booth at HIMSS, where you'll be able to experience our solutions firsthand. With that, we're ready to conclude our formal remarks. Thank you for listening today. Operator, we're ready to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets. Sean Dodge : Maybe just starting with the revenue guide. Your targets implied 6% growth for the first quarter, and about 6% growth for the full year. So it looks like it will be pretty flat growth trajectory over the course of the year. I would have thought, Brent, given the comments around bookings and being backlog and deferred revenue, you'd be expecting revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year. So maybe you can just help square that for me? Brent Lang : Yes. So I do think we feel good about coming into the year. We -- as you know, we tend to set our guidance on the conservative end of the spectrum. So we'd love to be towards the top end of that range. And I think we're still in the early stages of understanding really the market growth dynamics and so we don't really want to get ahead of ourselves. But I think it's fair to say that we're feeling good about where we ended the year and about the momentum that we have and the backlog that we have in the business. Sean Dodge : Okay. And then the 10% bookings growth for the full year, you said the fourth quarter wins were substantially higher year-on-year. Can you give us a sense of just how much higher fourth quarter was? I guess, with most of the growth for the year generated in this most recent quarter? Brent Lang : Yes, I think that's fair. We had a really strong fourth quarter after relatively mild growth in the previous quarters. And several of the large deals that I talked about, obviously, helped drive that. But overall, I think the sales team is feeling strong momentum right now. And it was a great way to finish the year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Guggenheim Securities. Vikram Kesavabhotla : I just want to talk about the sales force comments for a moment. I appreciate your commentary on how that's been evolving. Maybe if you can just talk about how far along you are in that transformation overall and maybe what the key changes are that you expect to make throughout 2020? And from a high level, how you characterize the productivity level of the sales force today relative to what you had throughout 2019? Brent Lang : Yes. So there's sort of two components to the changes we made in the sales force. The one was trying to upgrade to people that had more enterprise selling capabilities to be able to sell the C-suite with these larger more complex deals. And the second piece was to grow the absent number. So we're actually growing the size of our quota-carrying sales force to address the growing larger market opportunity that we see in front of us, both domestically and internationally. And those hires took place during the course of 2019, it sort of spread through Q2, Q3 and Q4. There's a few remaining that are still in the process of occurring, but the vast majority of the hiring has been completed. And then the corresponding sales ramp, obviously, is -- corresponds to when their start date was.  So we typically expect to see someone ramp to full speed within about 6 months of their hire date. And so some of those folks are now fully ramped and others are still in the process. But I think as we look into 2020, we expect the vast majority of them to be fully ramped for the full year. I came from our sales kickoff meeting last week in Dallas, and we have the whole group together and it was a really exciting meeting for me. And it was great to meet the new reps, a lot of great capabilities from folks who have been selling enterprise solutions, many of them for much larger organizations, into the C-suite and really understand that complex deal dynamic. So I think it was great to see them and meet them, and it really increased my level of confidence in their ability to succeed this year. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay. Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that. On the Smartbadge, if you can just give us an update on how the adoption trends have been and the associated attach rates with that and what you've embedded in the assumptions in the outlook for 2020? That would be great. Justin Spencer : Yes, our progress continues there. The -- we highlighted a few of the larger deals that had Smartbadges attached to them. And so we continue to kind of work through the dynamics of new customers versus existing customers. We're finding that existing customers are going to likely adopt the Smartbadge at natural points of refresh or large badge purchases. Well, it's a little bit easier for new customers to adopt because they're not as particularly tied to a previous technology. But overall, we're pleased with the progress. We've made some enhancements to the product. Brent talked about the wake word addition, which we're really excited about that we think just continues to enhance that hands-free experience for the Smartbadge. And then in terms of our assumptions for continued ramp of the product in 2020. They're relatively modest. The way we look at our device business is we look at it as a portfolio. And so our objective is to grow the overall device revenue category, which can come from a mix of B3000n and the original Vocera badge, the Smartbadge and now complemented by the 2 smartphone offerings that we have. And our goal is to offer our customers a true Device of Choice option and allow them to select the best set of devices that work the best with the software platform and that are best for their environment. So our assumptions for 2020 as it relates to the Smartbadge are quite modest. Operator : And your next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Ryan Daniels : Yes, just another one, Justin, for you on the guidance. You indicated that you have better visibility entering the year. Does that indicate a change in the philosophy of how you're providing guidance as it relates to bookings and backlog and then regards to the kind of percentage of revenue you think is locked up at least early on in the year versus maybe how you would report that or guide in the past? Justin Spencer : Yes. Ryan, I'd say that 2020 kind of represents the return to our historical norm or -- 2019 was a bit unusual because we had anticipated that there would be a bit more ramp in the second half that didn't quite materialize as we expected. And so 2020 is more similar in pattern to the years before that where we don't have as much of a back-end ramp. So for example, we expect our revenue to follow a seasonal curve of roughly 45% in the first half and then 55% in the second half. And that's spot on with where we were in 2018, 2017 and before that. The second thing is that because of the strength of our bookings, particularly at the end of the year, it allowed us to build a reasonably healthy amount of backlog and deferred revenue, and so we go into the year with a level of visibility that we didn't have at the beginning of last year and that, again, is more similar to where we were in in prior years.  And so as a result of that, we just feel better about where our guidance is. We try generally to be conservative with our guidance. The framework itself has not changed. We look at the amount of revenue we expect from our backlog and deferred revenue, the amount of supply that we expect, which has been very consistent and steady. And those two elements added together represent the amount of revenue that is visible to us at the beginning of the year. And I'd say we're in a better position now than we were at this point last year. Ryan Daniels : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, if I could. I know we're only supposed to have one. But EBITDA, it looks like the midpoint of guidance would be 9.4% EBITDA margins. This year, I think you reported 9.4%. But throughout your script, you indicated that gross margins would increase this year and profitability would increase and op expenses would be relatively similar it looks like year-over-year. So why wouldn't EBITDA be a little bit stronger from a percent margin basis on a year-over-year, with the organic growth returning? Justin Spencer : We expect -- with the organic revenue growth, we do expect our gross margins to increase. But we're also investing in our business. So operating expenses will increase a bit in 2020. The areas of investment, as we talked about, are primarily in sales and new product development. We're trying to kind of focus our spending -- manage our spending in other areas so that we can direct as much as we can to those -- essentially revenue generating or innovation-related areas. So we'll see our operating expenses increase. That's what creates kind of near term, a little bit less leverage. But in the long run, those investments are going to allow us to re-catalyze the profitability having said all that, we try to guide pretty conservatively with our EBITDA, and we're always targeting the higher end of the range. And so it's -- we think about kind of where we're targeting that would be our expectation to try and align with that at the higher end of the range. Operator : And your next question comes from Sean Weiland from Piper Sandler. Sean Wieland : Hey, Vocera. To ask Ryan's question a slightly different way, if we applied the same ratio of backlog to deferred revenue to forward 12-month revenue that you had last year as we're doing this year, it would suggest a number slightly higher than the high end of your range. So I want to understand are there specific mechanical issues or things that you see in that calculation that is different? Or is it just, be it, dialed up the conservatism a little bit. Brent Lang : Sean, we -- certainly, we're trying to be a bit more conservative where we can. I think probably the factor that I'd point to there, though, is there are several large deals in our backlog and they each have a little bit different timing. And so that can move -- if you're looking at a ratio like that, which is a good one to look at, but we also have to kind of factor in the timing of specific deals. We had a record quarter in terms of the size and impact of these larger deals on our bookings. And so they're -- most of those are now teed up to be delivered in 2020, and some will carry forward into even 2021, just because they're large projects. So that's probably the single most determinant of kind of how the timing of that unfolds. But overall, we feel like we're in a much better position from a backlog and deferred revenue standpoint. Sean Wieland : Okay. And then specifically on the OpEx, the R&D increase, can you call out maybe 1 or 2 big projects that you're spending the money on? Brent Lang : Yes, a couple of areas that we remain really excited about : one, is around the overall Voice experience. When we originally created Vocera, we were very much mavericks in the use of voice as a user interface. And it's an area where we feel like we've got lots of competitive differentiation. Speech recognition has become much more mainstream, and there's a lot more things we can do with it now. And so we're expanding -- what we're going to be offering in terms of that Voice user interface. And you and I talked about some of those things in the past are now becoming more of a reality. So that would be certainly one area; another area that I mentioned is the continuation of some of the integrations and really revitalizing and expanding integrations with other additional clinical systems and scaling the platform to be able to support these larger and larger system wins. 2019, was a lot of, what I'll call, sort of new product introductions of new platforms, both the Smartbadge and Vina. 2020 is more about scaling those to really address the needs of these very, very large customer deployments and the complexities of the integrations and workflows that they're wanting us to capture for them. Operator : And your question comes from Matthew Gillmor from Baird. Matthew Gillmor : This is probably related to Sean's first question, but I just wanted to ask specifically on the elongation of the sales process? And I know, obviously, that's a trend to you. Talks a lot about the last 2 quarters, and the fourth quarter bookings would obviously indicate maybe that's improving a little bit. I'm sure you don't want to declare a victory yet, but I was curious if you had any updated perspective on the elongation of the sales process and kind of how you're factoring that into guidance. Is that different than I think you were kind of calling out some lumpiness with deals with Sean, is this the same thing? Or is it -- would you characterize it as sort of a different dynamic? And how has that dynamic been trending? Brent Lang : So I think we're right in the middle of it. The trend line is certainly continuing towards these larger deals, the difference between where we are today versus where we were a year ago or two years ago is that we've had a longer period of time in this period of larger deals and longer sales cycles. And so eventually, sort of steady state that out. I'll just give you one interesting data point. I talked about the Norton deal $7.4 million win. This was a deal where we were awarded Vendor of Choice in 2018. And actually, when we came into 2019, had a high degree of confidence that it was going to book early in the year and actually planned to recognize the vast majority of the revenue associated with that deal in 2019. And in reality, even though we were -- been working on the deal for years and had been awarded Vendor of Choice two years ago, we just received that booking in Q4, and the revenue is now going to be in 2020 and beyond.  And so this is the new normal. I think it's taken some time for us to get used to that. But now that we have deals that are in various stages of closing within our pipeline, we have a much better understanding of what it takes to close these larger deals, and therefore, we can factor that into our forecasting methodology and evaluate both the pipeline and the backlog as it relates to revenue. So I don't think it's going to be a continuing slowing force on our business because we're now in a state where we've got various deals in various stages of closing, but we are definitely much more aware of what some of these deals take to close. Each one of them has kind of its own story. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. Fair enough. And then, yes, I think you called out some third-party device revenue that came through. And I was curious if Justin could quantify that so we could understand how that influenced revenue in the quarter. Justin Spencer : Matt, we don't break it out specifically, but I can tell you that a meaningful portion of the device growth was attributed to the Houston Methodist shipment. We do -- we provide the smartphone to Zebra smartphones and now the Spectralink Versity phones as a way to -- for the customer to essentially receive a combined solution from us. It's convenient for them. And they're able to work with one partner for the whole solution bundled with the software. We also, though, in the quarter, even absent that we also had growth in badges as well. So -- but the majority of the growth in device category did come from the Houstin Methodist smartphones. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gene Mannheimer from Dougherty & Company? Eugene Mannheimer : I want to ask the guidance question, a different way, cut it another way. If you had -- it sounds like you're drawing more of your guidance off backlog, right, than you did a year ago. So if you have 70% visibility into your midpoint today, how much visibility did you have a year ago when you gave guidance? Justin Spencer : Gene, we're probably not going to be in a position to share the exact numbers, but I can just tell you it's significantly better and so that's why we just feel like we're in a better situation. The backlog and deferred revenue we have more software backlog, which we think is going to yield better growth in 2020. And overall, as we look at the combination of our supplies and then the backlog and deferred that we expect to convert we're just in a much stronger position as it relates to the overall revenue target for the year. Eugene Mannheimer : That makes good sense. And follow-up with respect to the Smartbadge adoption that you're seeing, the product's been out now about a year. Is it still the dynamic that customers are piloting these in small phases or departments? Or when might we start to see that change and see more full house wide deployments of the Smartbadge? Brent Lang : I think we're well beyond the pilot stage, Gene. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got customers that are ordering hundreds of these Smartbadges at this point and particularly newer customers that are looking to standardize right out of the gate. They're going with the Smartbadge upfront. I mentioned the 2 deals in the Middle East that went Smartbadges house wide with their initial deployments. And even some of the existing customers are starting to roll out larger numbers. So it's definitely beyond the pilot stage. I think what we're seeing is that there continues to be a strong demand for this Device of Choice variability, and they're seeing specific use cases tied to the various devices that we offer, whether it be the badge, the Smartbadge or the smartphone for different groups of workers within the hospital. And really the power of the platform is the interoperability and the seamless communication between those different form factors. And I think it represents a really nice portfolio of products that allows the customer to get the device that's most appropriate for each style of worker. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. David Windley : I wanted to come at the operating expenses from a slightly different way. You've talked about incremental margin in the 30% to 40% range, I think, under normal circumstances, this guidance that you're giving today is more like 10%. So call it, $2 million to $3 million of additional operating expense investment. And I think you've pointed at some of the sales investments and some product development, R&D type investments. And then you've also said that the sales kind of top-grading is largely done. I guess, I wanted to understand a little bit of cadence, but I think I understand that reasonably well, but it sounds like the step function of operating expense is kind of already in place at the beginning of the year, is that right? And then do you think that beyond 2020, you'd get back to that 30% to 40% incremental margin algorithm? Justin Spencer : Hi, Dave. Yes, we continue to have what we believe is a very attractive financial model. And as we've been able to demonstrate in the company's history, we do have inherently operating leverage in that kind of a range. We actually are going -- we're targeting leverage. It's a little bit higher than what you stated. But what I would just say is that as we think about the transition now to 2020, as Brent touched on in his prepared remarks, we've made a significant portion of the sales investments that already we've made those in the back half of the year. And to some extent, also the R&D. So our actual amount of new hiring, if you will, in 2020, is relatively modest. We put the people in place, really at the end of the year. And so what happens is you have kind of a full year effect. So as you look now to our first quarter operating expenses, there will be likely a step-up from Q4, just as a result of the full year effect. And then it will remain relatively constant because we're not going to be adding significantly more heads at the year -- as the year progresses. And then from there as we get to the back half of the year and then hopefully looking into 2021, we'll be in a really strong position to get back to the kind of leverage that we've been more accustomed to over the last several years. David Windley : Great. And if I can ask a slightly different question. Brent, I think in your comments, you commented about some prod development investment strategies, which connotes that you want to build some things, I guess, I wanted to gauge your appetite for buying technology, buying acquisitions. And if you're leaning more toward building, would you entertain the possibility of deploying some of your capital into your stock? Brent Lang : So it's definitely a combination of both building and buying. We have an appetite for doing both. And we haven't made an acquisition in a couple of years, but we remain active in looking at deals. And we put a couple of term sheets forward on deals that we've found to be strategically important to us. But in a couple of cases, we're outbid by private equity firms that pay prices on these deals that we just didn't feel were appropriate. And so in some cases, we decided to go ahead and invest the R&D to build that capability in-house. And in other cases, we'll continue to look for future acquisition opportunities. With regard to the last part of your question, we don't have plans at this point to evaluate any kind of stock buyback. We think a better use of capital is to invest it in the business either through internal organic development or through the inorganic activities that we're pursuing. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Matthew Hewitt : I apologize, I jumped on a little bit late, so if these were answered or addressed in your prepared remarks, I apologize. But regarding [indiscernible] in the United Arab Emirates. In the most recent press release, you mentioned 11 additional hospitals coming on board. Is there a timing set for those? I mean, how should we be thinking about those coming on board? Is that over the course of '20? Does it extend into '21? Justin Spencer : Yes. So we don't really have a specific time line associated with that. What that is, is really an agreement a purchasing vehicle, the outline that we've been named as their kind of Vendor of Choice. And when you're dealing with the Middle East, the exact time frame for when those POs and bookings and ultimate deployments will occur is a little bit hard to know. We're encouraged by the activity that's going on there, but I can't give you any more detail in terms of specific timing. Matthew Hewitt : Okay. And then, I guess, the last one here. A lot of discussion about the additions to the sales force over the back half of last year, and it sounds like you're pretty much complete. What does that headcount sit at today relative to last year? And maybe a little bit -- digging a little bit deeper, how many of your existing sales force would you say are new over the past 6 months? Brent Lang : So rough numbers, I think, about 20 of the quota-carriers are new. And the new number is -- and we're constantly cycling. So there's -- there continues to be swap out some of those are replacement of existing people and some of those were incremental hires. I think the total quota-carriers is around 80. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to the leader for closing remarks. Brent Lang : Thank you, and appreciate everyone's time today and look forward to catching up with you and seeing you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. On today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with some perspectives on our mix of deferrable and capital businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarter results and liquidity position before we open the call to Q&A. As you know, Katherine will be shifting out of her role on June 1, so this will be her last Stryker earnings call. While this is not quite the finish she had in mind at the end of February, I did want to take a moment to express my gratitude for her outstanding work the past 13 years. She has been a great help to me and the management team of Stryker. Also if you include her time covering Stryker as a sell-side analyst, this will be her 97th Stryker earnings call. She has seen a lot, but nothing quite like what we are going through right now. On today's call, we will review our first quarter results and provide additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses in March and into the second quarter. I would also highlight many initiatives underway to ensure we maintain a strong cash position through stringent controls to manage through this unprecedented environment.  For Q1, we achieved organic sales growth of 2.4%, reflecting strong momentum through the first two months of the quarter and into March, followed by a marked slowdown tied principally to a deferral in elective procedures. We took a number of steps in March to aggressively limit travel to ensure the safety of our employees and customers, while ensuring our essential personnel were available to support health care workers around the world. These efforts, along with other cost controls, helped to mitigate some of the impact on earnings, from the slowdown in sales resulting in adjusted per share earnings of $1.84, a decline of 2% versus the prior year. The sales drop became more pronounced towards the end of March, and in the last week of the month, our company sales declined 30% versus the prior year. The biggest declines were in hips, knees, spine and endoscopy, offset by our other businesses. By geography, Japan, Canada, and smaller countries in Europe and emerging markets performed well, while China was clearly the weakest.  In Q2, we expect a recovery in China, but most other geographies will get worse, given the spread of the virus. For the month of April, our company sales will decline by 35% to 40% versus 2019. Looking at the remainder of the quarter, we are encouraged by the planned gradual resumption of elective surgeries in the U.S. and abroad. Portfolio products are being impacted by COVID-19 in numerous ways. Clearly, we are seeing a deferral in elective procedures, particularly within our orthopedics and spine businesses. We fully expect, given the chronic and progressive nature of the conditions impacting these patients, that the vast majority of them will be treated in the coming months, recognizing that the exact timing of a broad resumption of elective procedures is too fluid to predict. And as hospital needs to treat COVID-19 patients escalated sharply in March and into April, we saw a significant increase in the demand of products across our roughly $2 billion medical portfolio, which Katherine will discuss in more detail. In response, our manufacturing teams have been aggressively ramping capacity of much needed products while also ensuring we scale back other plants where demand has been negatively impacted.  Overall, given our mix of businesses and the cost control initiatives underway, coupled with our strong balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this slowdown. Given the fluid nature of the current situation, we are not providing Q2 or full year guidance. However, we expect to maintain the cost control efforts for most of 2020. We are also setting ourselves up to respond quickly as customer demands return. We are providing financial assistance to hold our sales forces in place and continue to invest in our pipeline of new products. We are proceeding with integration efforts regarding Wright Medical. And given the impact of the virus on competitive hiring, we are expecting a minimal level of sales force attrition. As was publicly announced, Wright held its shareholder meeting on Friday, April 24, and the deal was approved. This reduced the tender of threshold from 95% to 80%. The tender offer was extended until June 30, which is customary as we continue to work through the closing conditions. We expect to close around the end of Q3 2020.  Please note, beyond this update, we have no new information to share with you regarding Wright Medical and we will not be taking any questions on this pending acquisition during today's call.  Before I turn the call over to Katherine, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our employees around the globe for their commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families and our customers. Our sales forces across our businesses who are essential to supporting doctors and caregivers have demonstrated unwavering commitment during this pandemic.  Our manufacturing teams have worked tirelessly to optimize the plant network and to ramp capacity where needed. And we have created rapid innovations in response to the pandemic. We will continue to support our employees and our customers as they work to meet the needs of the many patients that will need treatment. While our many year growth momentum has been temporarily derailed, the Stryker spirit is alive and well and we remain poised to capitalize as the situation improves. And now over to Katherine. Katherine Owen : Thanks, Kevin. My update today will focus on providing greater granularity around our mix of businesses that are particularly impacted by the COVID-19 virus. Overall, we estimate that 40% to 50% of our total global revenue include procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately, can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. This includes primarily our orthopedic businesses, including hips and knees, extremities as well as spine and Neurotech's ENT. There are also procedures within our endoscopy portfolio that can be deferred, including some of the scoping procedures and sports medicine.  Additionally, with many states and countries having implemented or recently come out of state-at-home orders, we have seen a slowdown in trauma. This can be attributed to fewer people out driving, a slowdown in construction and general decline in overall activity that traditionally drives trauma procedures. Unlike truly elective procedures, the patients deferring surgeries addressed by our products will not improve with time, rather, their underlying conditions generally continue to deteriorate. So while the exact timing of the resumption of elective procedures to more normalized level is difficult to predict at this point in time, we do anticipate the vast majority of patients treated by our products will return. We also assume the resumption of procedures will continue to vary by country, state and municipality as they increasingly move past the peak impact of the virus.  In contrast to the impact we are seeing from deferred surgeries, other parts of our portfolio are experiencing significantly heightened demand, as Kevin noted. This is most noteworthy for our medical business, which had sales of roughly $2.3 billion in 2019 or approximately 15% of total Stryker revenue and is comprised primarily of capital equipment. It's important to recognize that our capital equipment portfolio, which represented about 25% of our total sales in 2019, includes both large capital and small capital at about 9% and 16%, respectively.  Our large capital equipment offering includes Mako, beds and structures within medical, Endoscopy's communication portfolio and Spine's enabling technology, which includes Mobius and navigation. Turning to smaller capital equipment, this bucket includes medical emergency costs and defibrillators, Endoscopy's cameras, Instrument's power tools and waste management, and neuro-powered instruments that are reported within Neurotechnology. Of note, small capital is typically used in the OR and, as such, tracks more closely to growth in procedures.  Against that backdrop, we are seeing strong demand across essentially the entirety of the medical offering, including beds and stretchers, physio, emergency cost and Sage. We are also seeing meaningful increase in demand for Instruments flight personal protection offerings, which is included in their base product portfolio within surgical technologies.  Across the board, we have ramped capacity to meet the current demand and what we anticipate will be ongoing demand as hospitals look to better position their capacity and stockpiles going forward. In late March, we developed the Stryker emergency release bed, which helps emergency responders manage patients efficiently during this critical time. We started manufacturing this low-cost bed at the end of March, which broadens our medical offering beyond ICU and MedSurg beds to better meet customer needs. Other efforts to assist with responding to COVID-19 include the production of face shields for health care professionals and a new patient protective covering product, which attaches to our ambulant structures.  Overall, while the slowdown in elective procedures has and will continue to impact our top line, we are able to leverage our unique product portfolio and offset part of that impact through the demand for our medical and instrument offered. We expect this trend will continue into Q2 with an ongoing gradual increase in elective procedures. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Katherine. Your comments are as insightful as always. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, related drivers and certain liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 2.4% in the quarter. These results included U.S. growth of 2% and international growth of 3.3%, recognizing that approximately 75% of total sales, our business is significantly weighted in the U.S. As a reminder, this quarter included 1 additional selling day as compared to Q1 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.4% from the prior year quarter, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.9% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries that occurred in the last 2 weeks of March. This impact was most pronounced on our joint replacement procedures. In light of the current environment, we wanted to provide additional detail with respect to our businesses and geographies. For the month of April, our U.S. Orthopedics and spine sales were down roughly 65%, while MedSurg and Neurotechnology posted declines of roughly 25%. Asia Pacific declined roughly 20%, while Europe was down nearly 55%. Our Latin American business was solid, delivering 20% growth for the month of April. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.84 represents a decline of 2.1% from Q1 2019. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.02 from foreign currency, which was slightly higher than our previous expectations, given currency fluctuations. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS, including the loss of higher-margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. In addition, the lack of share buybacks in Q1 2020 resulted in a higher-than-average share count outstanding.  I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopaedics had constant currency and organic decline of 1.2%. This included U.S. growth of 0.3%. This growth included positive impacts from knees, trauma and extremities and Mako. Internationally, Orthopaedics had an organic decline of 4.3%, which primarily reflects an earlier downturn in certain geographies. MedSurg had constant currency growth of 7% and organic growth of 6.3%, which included a 5.6% increase in the U.S.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.8%, driven by gains in their surgical cutting blades, waste management, Steri-Shield, Surg account and smoke evacuation product lines. This performance was particularly impressive given the tough comps from Q1 2019 and further validates our decision to split the sales force into orthopaedic instruments and surgical technologies.  Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.9%. This reflects positive growth in its core video and general surgery products, offset by a slowdown in its communications and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.1%, reflecting strong demand across its bed and emergency care businesses, which accelerated meaningfully in the latter part of March, owing to demand tied to COVID-19.  Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 9.1%, reflecting a slower impact to capital businesses in key geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 1.5% and an organic growth of 0.3%. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 0.2% and a 0.6% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the latter half of March and some temporary supply disruptions during the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 9% and reflects balanced growth across most geographies and businesses.  Now I will discuss operating metrics for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.3% was unfavorable 50 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by price, acquisitions, business mix and fixed cost absorption, the latter 2 of which were more pronounced during the second half of March. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.8% of sales, which was 40 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix, deleveraging of selling and marketing costs and foreign exchange, and this was partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during March.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24% of sales. Given the current environment, we enacted measures in March covering most of our discretionary spending. These included curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings, consultants as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities, including furloughing the related workers. Subsequent to March, we also have enacted salary reductions impacting most of our leadership positions.  Related to other income and expense, we saw a benefit in investment income, which was partially offset by increased interest expense related to the eurobond offering that was completed late last year. Moving forward, though, given an unexpected decline in investment income earned on deposits and the impact of other rate changes, OI&E will increase by approximately $5 million to $8 million per quarter. This does not include the impact of any additional debt issuance for Wright Medical. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.3%. This included the benefit related to stock compensation expense and other discrete items.  Turning to cash flow and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of $4 billion and generated approximately $591 million of cash from operations in the quarter. This is ahead of our internal targets and significantly more than in Q1 2019. This reflects increased earnings and a reduction in working capital, primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchase any shares in Q1, nor do we plan to do so during the remainder of the year.  In addition to the discretionary spending controls I previously outlined, we have also taken steps to conserve cash. Including reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Considering our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we are well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion.  In addition, our investment-grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets, and we would anticipate taking advantage of historically low rates to complete the funding for Wright Medical. In terms of future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million, and we have 1 $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q2 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the significance of uncertainties at this time.  We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances in the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Congrats to Katherine, 97 is a big number. A couple of -- two quick things. One, first, Kevin, for you. I'd love some help. And I think about your capital businesses. I'm curious, are there scenarios where you think the increase in demand that you're seeing lasts more than a few quarters? And then just generally, what could happen to growth on the other side of the demand surge? Kevin Lobo : So Bob, I'll take that, the first part, and then I'll pass it to Katherine. As it relates to large capital, I think Katherine provided you the breakdown of our large capital in her prepared remarks. The beds and stretchers are the ones experiencing kind of a spike in demand. And at this point, it's really too difficult to ascertain whether that's pull forward or whether that's just extra demand because there is this need to build stockpiles. There is this need to have beds -- certain number of beds and expansion of beds, primarily related to coronavirus, but it may not be something that's just pull forward, it may be additional demand.  As it relates to the other large capital communications, Mako and those other components, those -- that's going to start to slow down, as you probably would imagine. We're not seeing orders being canceled, but there is a bit of deferral going on. And that I would expect would continue to pick up in the future. And maybe I'll turn it to Katherine to talk about small capital. Katherine Owen : Yes, Bob, first of all, thank you. It's -- I would say, if you look at small capital, that's about 16% of the total, and it does tend to track with surgeries. So that business has not benefited anywhere near to the same degree as the medical, particularly beds and stretchers have. So I think you're going to see that be more in line with our elective procedures come back on. And some of it is going to be tied to hospital liquidity. And keep in mind, through Flex Financial, we have a lot of ability here to help hospitals think about different constructs to finance those purchases.  So it's very different from the Great Recession in terms of how medical business is being impacted. But I do think there's going to be continued uncertainty around the pull forward because we just don't have a strong sense yet what the new norm is going to look like for stockpiling. Robert Hopkins : And I guess just one quick follow-up, sort of another big picture question. Kevin, a few of the other medical device CEOs have offered up that they think growth could return by the fourth quarter. And I'm just curious if you -- from what you're seeing in the world and in terms of what you're seeing from your customers, do you share that optimism? Or are you a little bit more cautious? Kevin Lobo : Well, thanks, Bob. As you can imagine, we've run a lot of scenarios, and I don't have a crystal ball, but certainly, that is a scenario that we think could very well happen. The pent-up demand is there. I think the recovery will probably come in waves. So you have a number of employees that are furloughed that would love to get their procedures done now while they have health care coverage, worried about what could happen in the future. That could be a first wave of resumption of procedures. And then you also have people who have taken time off and that may not be able to take time off later, so that could cause a slight dip and then a resumption again. But it really is going to relate to how the overall economy recovers and how the virus evolves in the future. But that certainly is a scenario that we believe could happen. But again, this is unchartered water. So we'll see. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : I'm going to echo Bob's comments, Katherine. Congratulations. Just a couple of quick questions for me. I wanted to follow up a little bit on maybe a different way of focusing on Bob's question. But there's a view, Kevin, right now that amongst some of your peers, economic exposure to recon is somehow different, so first, there's other device procedures that's somewhat less -- that are more less deferrable, orthopaedics is sort of more deferrable. What are your thoughts around the economic sensitivity of hips and knees be? It's sort of the perception that they are very economically sensitive but the data is not exactly clear initially into a notion that people think ortho would recover after other types of medical device implantable procedures. What's your view on that economic exposure and your recovery relative to other med tech? Kevin Lobo : Well, David, I mean, obviously, this is uncharted waters, as I mentioned at the end of my answer to Bob's question. But what I would say is the hospitals are very motivated to do our procedures. If you think about orthopedics and spine procedures, they are moneymakers for hospitals. And the hospitals who are treating coronavirus patients now are bleeding in their P&LS. So there's a financial motivation. Also, patients certainly that are suffering would like to get those procedures done. So I'm not in some of the other spaces of other elective procedures, so it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast. But the hospital CEOs and the surgeons that I've spoken to are all absolutely gearing up to start bringing back their patients. And the surveys they've done with patients have suggested that patients are very comfortable coming back. As soon as the hospitals say it's going to be safe for them, I think those patients will be coming back. So I don't believe that there's something unique about orthopaedic surgery that would cause that to be pushed to the back of the line. On the contrary, given its economic impact to the hospitals, I think it could be moved earlier in the chain. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And then just a related question. Just Glenn gave us some numbers on the percent decline in April procedures. So a couple of questions there were just have you seen in recent days or a rolling 7-day average, a recovery or any kind of bounce off the trough for your Orthopaedic procedures? And there's been a lot of discussion around inpatient versus outpatient. Have you seen a difference in terms of how procedures are recovering if they are in inpatient versus outpatient? Is there an opportunity to use this particular pandemic as a way of pushing more procedures to the outpatient market? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, David, there's a couple of questions in that. I think the first one, the percentages that I gave you are absolutely up to date. And so I don't have any sort of further data or information that would support a bifurcation of that. In terms of looking at what's going to outpatient or what's inpatient, I think it's still too early and it's still dynamic, and it's evolving in the moment. So it's something that we obviously are watching very closely. And as soon as we have data or monitoring on it, we would provide that. But I'll let Katherine comment on that as well. Katherine Owen : Yes. I just would follow-up, David. Just keep in mind, the shift to recon procedures in the ASC setting is already underway. This probably continues us down that path, but there's only so much capacity. There are about 300 ASCs in the U.S. that are doing hip and knee procedures. They are essentially running at full capacity. Now they may be able to do more by staying later on working weekends. But that is really dwarfed by the number of hospitals in the U.S., which is about 5,000. So I think you're going to see the shift continue, but I wouldn't expect some massive climate change in the trend because the capacity just isn't there to absorb it. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Maybe one on the robotics side. I know it falls into the large capital bucket. Is there a view that either hospitals see this as a differentiated investment as a way of differentiating themselves from peers. So when we think about in the post-COVID world, that demand should normalize for something like Mako? Or just maybe give us some color on how we should be thinking of what Mako, because there is a view of that as systems are capacity constrained, maybe utilization of robotics might be -- might lag a little bit here. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that those surgeons that are believers in Mako or believers in robotics will resume their normal amount of work. We had terrific momentum. You can even see if you look at the line of other Orthopaedics, it performed very well in the quarter. We did see a bit of a slowdown in some of the Mako orders being delayed a little bit. So liquidity of the hospitals is important when you're outlaying large amounts of money. But we see tremendous signs of continued interest. No order is being canceled, just being delayed a little bit until elective surgeries resumes. And yes, hospitals do see it as a differentiator, and we continue to be very bullish about the prospects of Mako.  Underscoring what Katherine said earlier about Flex Financial, I think that's something that we're going to use even more probably as ASCs want to acquire Makos, and they don't typically have the same size of capital budgets, but we have a number of different vehicles to help them finance their capital. And so we do expect to Mako to absolutely resume the kind of trajectory we're on once the elective surgery comes back in force. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Kevin. And maybe one for Glenn. On the cost structure, fixed versus variable, how should we think about decremental margins here as you think about the next, call it, 3 to 12 months? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. At this point, just given sort of the fluidity of the situation and looking forward, I'm not sure that I can guide you to an exact sort of margin number. I will say that to the extent expenses are discretionary, what I've mentioned, travel meetings, consulting and many other things, we have curtailed those or discontinued those. We discontinued most of our hiring, and we furloughed manufacturing employees that are at facilities where we've slowed down or stopped certain lines. It's really difficult to sort of predict our exact operating state. I do think some of those expenses, obviously, will come back as we ramp back up. But at this point in time, as I think about our future cost structure, I do anticipate that many of these things will be impacted and we'll feel the impact from them throughout the remainder of this year and, frankly, on into 2021. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Just one follow-up, if I could, on ASC for Katherine, your comments on the number of orthopaedic-oriented sort of ASCs out there. Could you talk a little bit about the potential impact on spine? And then I had 1 follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sure. I can take the first part of that. Okay. Sorry, Katherine. I'll start that. So spine procedures are done in the ASCs, but they tend to be the more basic procedures like ACDS. So it's not an enormous part of the overall spine market, and we think we're well positioned there to be able to deliver the products need for those procedures. Sorry, Katherine, go ahead. Katherine Owen : No, nothing additional. Just to say, it's probably low single digits, the percent of spine procedures that are done in the ASC setting at this time. Matthew Miksic : Got it. Okay. And then on just some of the -- to your point about the bulk of the lift here in terms of returning to elective orthopedic procedures, sounds like from your description, needs to happen in acute care centers. What are the next steps that you see happening there? What are the constraints, I guess? States are just starting to open up. Is it the middle of May? Is it some percentage of utilization that we start to see? What would be the things that you expect to see over the next several weeks to help us understand if that's happening and to what degree? Katherine Owen : I think it's going to be very gradual. We're seeing states, and not just in the U.S., overseas, they're moving slowly, and it really just depends where they are in meeting guidelines, where they are in peak cases. So we don't have a perfect formula to tell you what it's going to look like. It just seems to be pointing in the direction, and this is uncharted territory, but pointing in the direction that we're going to continue to see more and more states resume elective procedures. Those patients need to be treated.  As Kevin indicated, it's a profitable procedure for hospitals. And so I think it's just going to be gradual. So we're probably in a better position a month from now than we are today, but it's also very much a wait and see as hospitals get increasingly comfortable and start to recognize the new normal of how they deal with COVID patients while also recognizing they have to treat the broader spectrum of patients. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that comment is a lot of hospitals are actually gearing up to be able to work extra hours even on weekends. They won't do that day one. Obviously, they're going to gradually start to bring patients back, but that's something that they're planning for in the back half of the year. And so I do expect, as I mentioned before, seeing this recovery come back in waves is pretty likely. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : One product question and one kind of big picture question. Just on the April trend of negative 25%, I think, for Neurotechnology and Spine, did that apply to your neurovascular business as well? Or has that been more resilient? And I had 1 follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes, Larry. Yes, that did include our neurovascular business as well in that statistic. Lawrence Biegelsen : Got it. And Kevin, just taking a step back, what do you think the long-term implications are of this -- of coronavirus for med tech? And how are you positioning Stryker for success in a post coronavirus world? Kevin Lobo : No, thanks. That's a big question. I would tell you that I think we're very well positioned given the diversity -- diversification of our portfolio. Obviously, elective surgeries are very important to us, but we're not only an elective surgery company. And the fact that MedSurg is the largest of our 3 segments certainly helps protect us and insulate us from the full effect. I think that diversification will serve us well, but -- and we believe still in our strategy. And this is not going to cause a change in our strategy of category leadership and leading positions in all the segments we choose to play in. It's not going to take us off our approach to M&A. We will emerge from this, and we believe the fact that we've stayed and conserved a fairly conservative balance sheet has really helped us. And even with the upcoming Wright Medical acquisition, we have a very good and strong financial position.  Things will change. There will be a lot less travel. I could tell you that we've learned a lot about technology. The way we're engaging with customers through this has been amazing for me to watch, surgeon engagement, hospital engagement. And even our employees, we tend to be a high-touch culture and we're learning that technologies, you can do a lot of really amazing education things with technology. So that, I think, will become a more permanent thing. And our R&D teams are learning how to work very, very effectively, including surgeon collaborations virtually.  So those are the things that will be more, I think, more permanent. The trend to ASCs will only accelerate. But as Katherine mentioned, a long way to go still. But that pace will increase. Those are probably the 2 things I would point out to. But other than that, I think we're just going to be getting back to the regular offense that we had before. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : I want to echo thanks to Katherine for lots of your help over the years. First question is, as several states are moving to allow surgeries to start happening again, what is your sales force in those states telling you about what the doctors are planning? And how does OR block schedules look in those states? Katherine Owen : Thanks, Pito. I don't have any definitive data because it really does vary. You have hospitals, even in New York, where we know they're gearing up to resume procedures, elective procedures, hip and knees, in particular, in May. And I think it's really going to depend on the type of hospital or teaching institution or where they're located geographically. So they may be doing more procedures over the weekends, more procedures in the evening. I think they're all going to be highly motivated. We do know that their waitlist of patients is pretty high. We are hearing that the patients -- I know there's some concerns, will they be willing to go back to hospitals, what we're hearing when we talk to customers, their waitlist remain healthy and patients are listening to their doctors. They listen to them when they said, don't have the surgery right now. And when they tell them it's safe to come back in and they realize they're not going to be going in to get their hip and need done through the emergency room, where their concerns are much greater, they're comfortable with it. But there's no perfect model to say this is how they're going to deal with it. I think there's going to be flexibility and a number of different methods that take place to address the backlog of these patients that need to be treated. Philip Chickering : Great. And then for neuro, like you mentioned that there are some supply disruptions that you saw for neuro supply. Can you look at that a little more and talk about which other facilities you idled and like how are your inventory levels for these products? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. We had, as you probably heard, an earthquake in Salt Lake City, which is one of our manufacturing facilities for neurovascular. That caused a slight disruption in that business. And then we also had a bit of supply challenges with the Neuro Powered Instruments portfolio. And those, again, are temporary nature. This happens to us from time to time over the years. You hear this. In 1 quarter, we might have a slight disruption in supply. And so those are the two things that hit the Neurotechnology business, both of which are largely resolved or will be resolved certainly by the time we get to Q3, Q4. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum from SunTrust. Kaila Krum : So you mentioned that you've made several cost-cutting adjustments. So my question is, if demand does return sort of fairly quickly in the second part of this year, are you comfortable that you have the infrastructure, supply and manufacturing employees in place to support that demand? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Kaila. It's one of the things that literally we are meeting almost every other day on in terms of how do we need to position ourselves to ramp back up and getting a good feel for what products will be in demand and where are we from an inventory standpoint with those products. And also, how are we preparing for our employees to come back to work so that we can meet that demand. So I do feel like we are positioning ourselves very well, and we have a pretty good understanding of where we think demand will peak, and we're doing all we can to be ready for that to happen. Kaila Krum : Okay. That's helpful. And then you guys mentioned you're slowing M&A activity. Does that effectively mean we shouldn't expect any M&A activity outside of Wright for the rest of the year? Or what would be sort of a catalyst to push you guys to be more sort of opportunistic on M&A in this environment? Kevin Lobo : Yes. And you mentioned Wright, we actually have the biggest M&A going on right now that we've ever had ever. So that's one thing that we obviously are focused on. I guess I would say that business development remains sort of an ongoing part of our long-term strategy. And obviously, we'll balance potential opportunities with our liquidity position and where we want to be even next year and the following year on liquidity. But I could see that we would get back to smaller tuck-in acquisitions. We have slowed it. We have paused it. We have not turned it off. We're keeping close to the market just to understand. But I think, in some ways, it will allow us to have more time over target and be smarter about where we are choosing to execute on M&A opportunities. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. I wanted to ask about MedSurg. You gave some great clarity into the areas that are benefiting. And Kevin, I think you said it really well, you don't have a crystal ball, you don't know what's going to happen. But maybe in the 2 scenarios, one where there is a second wave, one where there is not, is this a business that you think saw stockpiling or acceleration of purchases here? Or do you think there's still a lot more to come through the rest of the year? Should we see another wave of infections? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think the demand -- we're -- in some of our categories, we're selling everything we can make right now. So I would say we're a long way from having filled up any stockpiles. So I think if this coronavirus continues at an accelerated pace or if there's a second wave, I would expect a commensurate increase in the sales of those products, be it the flight protection, system and instruments or the majority of the medical portfolio. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe on the financial side, how should we be thinking about free cash flow this year relative to earnings? Are you going to be building inventory here? Anything that we should pay attention to that would change the conversion rate materially from free cash flow -- from net income to free cash flow? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think, Robbie, the single biggest thing we're going to feel in the coming quarters related to free cash flow is just going to be reduced earnings. And frankly, if there's less sale, there's less accounts receivable to collect. And so that will be the single biggest impact, I think, that we'll feel. We obviously -- with manufacturing slowed and certain manufacturing lines idled, we're mindful of not building inventories and where we do think that we might have to build inventories. We're very selective in terms of how we think that will come back. So I really think, given the uncertainties that we will be facing, we're making very prudent decisions relative to cash conservation. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Congratulations, Katherine. We'll miss you. First, Kevin, maybe you could expand on your comments on the international business generally. You highlighted, obviously, China was the weakest in the first quarter internationally. And you gave us the April down 35% to 40%. I think that was a worldwide. Now I wasn't sure if that was worldwide or U.S. But regardless, are you seeing any signs of recovery in some of the weakest international markets? If yes, maybe you could just give us a little additional color about how you expect those weaker international areas to recover and whether that informs your thinking at all about the U.S.? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Rick. What I would say is, certainly, China was the most negative in the first quarter. The 35% to 40% number I gave was a global number. So that's what April is finishing, but I don't have the exact number because, is it the last day? We haven't closed a month, but it will be in that 35% to 40% range.  What we saw in the first quarter, certainly, China was very negative. That is recovering. I think they're back to roughly 60% to 70% of where they normally were prior to the virus. And it's sort of gradually improving. So China is getting healthier. Japan, we had a terrific first quarter in Japan, and I think that will get marginally worse in the second quarter. But they've done a very good job of managing it. Same thing with South Korea. We had a very good first quarter, and we're not seeing South Korea slow down. The big wildcard in the international market is Europe. And even Australia, to some degree, where Australia had initially said that they were going to cancel all elective surgeries for the entire quarter. And now 2 weeks later, 25% of the procedures are now back and being scheduled. So that's how fluid it is. Just in 2 weeks, they went from nothing for the whole quarter to back to 25%. So all this to say, it's going to be difficult to predict what happens in the U.K., what's going to happen in Germany. And so Europe is the wildcard area. I think it's certainly going to be worse than it was in the first quarter. And how much worse, it's hard to say right now. I think for us, Europe was something in the 55% down range in April. And I think that's likely going to continue throughout this quarter. It should get better towards the end of the quarter. But again, it's hard to predict. Frederick Wise : And just as a follow-up on the knee business. Maybe you could just again give us a little more color and your high-level thinking. I know we don't have all the numbers yet, more to come, but your U.S. knee business held up relatively well. I mean, honestly. And maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you're pursuing to sustain what would have seemed to be likely outperformance in the first quarter and even under challenging conditions in the second quarter. Some of the detailed initiatives that you're undertaking with surgeons using Mako. Just any additional commentary would be very welcome. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Thanks, Rick. I'll start. Maybe Katherine can add to it. What I would say is there's nothing magical about our first quarter knee. It's the continuation of the trend of the last 4 years or 5 years where we've been consistently taking market share. I'm very proud of the work that our team has done on Mako as well as cementless. Both of which, as you saw over the last 2 or 3 years, have had steep increases in their adoption rates. And that continued in the first quarter. I could tell you, at the end of February, we were feeling really, really good about our knee number. And then just like everybody else, there was a falloff that occurred about midway through March. The fact that it still ended the quarter in a positive territory for U.S. knees is pretty incredible. We're really pleased with that. And so again, it's just continued amazing momentum with Mako and with cementless, which are both huge portions of the knee sales that we have. And surgeons are very, very loyal to both Mako and to cementless based on the great outcomes they're getting with their patients. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Patrick Bartoski : This is Patrick on for Matt. I'd like to start on your spine business. In 2019, you made a lot of good progress integrating K2M and getting that business up and running. So prior to the COVID-19 disruptions, I'd love to hear more color as to the dynamics that was happening within that business in January and February. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I'm very pleased with how our spine business is progressing. Certainly, in the international markets, you see very good numbers. We even posted pretty good numbers in the first quarter. That's a continuation of what we saw last year. In the U.S., we started to see the improvement really in the November, sort of December time frame. That was continuing into January and February, and a number of new products were launched in the first quarter. Unfortunately, that got derailed, just like everybody else's spine business, around the middle of March, and we're not immune from that. But I would say I feel as good as I felt about our spine business since the acquisition of K2M. Every day, we sort of continue to build momentum.  And even the Mobius business, which we acquired towards the end of last year, is seeing tremendous demand as some hospitals are actually using it to do x-rays of the chest for the coronavirus. So we're actually trying to ramp our capacity of Mobius, which is, as you know, a mobile CT scan and really the only one in the market that's mobile, and they're using it for coronavirus. So we're actually ramping that capacity. So overall, the outlook for the future for spine is positive, as positive as we felt kind of entering the year. Patrick Bartoski : Great. That's really helpful color. And I had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind. I'd like to talk about clinical trials. We're hearing from other med tech peers that they're seeing anywhere from 6 months of delays on some of their trials. I know Stryker has had a great track record of new product introductions and has a lot of clinical trial catalysts. So is there anything material we need to think about from a clinical trial or new product perspective? And is 6 months the right way to think about some delays due to coronavirus? Kevin Lobo : Yes. We're actually pretty fortunate that we don't have any major launches upcoming that are contingent to clinical trials. It's always a timing issue. If you just look at where our neurovascular or our PMA products portfolios are in their life cycle, we really don't have anything major pending. I think 6 months is a good way to look at it. We do have some minor delays in approvals. So some products, just getting them approved. If you think about our aspiration products in neurovascular, getting them approved in Europe. They are approved in the U.S. and we had a limited launch in the first quarter, which is proving very successful, but those aren't yet approved in Europe. So Europe is just overwhelmed with UMDR and other product approval site. That's more probably in the 3-month time frame than 6-month. But what's affecting us, at least in the short term, is more around getting products approved outside of clinical trials, and there really isn't anything major that's holding us back from a clinical trial standpoint. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Kristen Stewart : I'll echo the commentary on Katherine. It's been really great, knowing you both from the sell-side perspective and on the company perspective. You've done a great job just in your role, both on the IR and on the business development front. So I guess, one, I just wanted to go back to the question on this Medsurg and Neurotech down 25 because I would imagine a lot of different moving parts within those 2 kind of categories. Is there any way just to kind of give us a little bit more detail there to just kind of help us understand some of the puts and takes out of -- imagine on the medical side, you're seeing quite a bit of a benefit probably within the neurovascular. As Larry was kind of saying, it's probably one that's pretty defensive. And then maybe within some other areas within MedSurg, you're probably seeing a little bit more of a downtick just as some of that's more kind of capital. So any way to just kind of frame some of those moving parts or quantify some of the benefit that you're seeing from COVID? That would be really helpful. And I have 1 follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Yes. I think why you -- you did a pretty good summary. But I guess what I would say is, as you look at the number, you're right, medical is showing fairly strong positive numbers. I would say, across the rest of the portfolio, it was negative and it ranged anywhere, negative from 20% to as much as maybe 40% or 50%, depending on the business. Capital is a little lumpy, too. So some of the capital businesses were able to deliver and make deliveries during the month of April. And so they saw a little more favorability. I do think that as we move into May, we'll continue to see some of those downturns in that similar trend that we saw in April. And it might be a little more pronounced as some of the capital businesses trail off. Kristen Stewart : Any way to quantify medical? And then my follow-up would just be on gross margins, how should we just think about as some of the plants are seeing lower throughput and you have some sitting idle, are you going to be expensing some of those -- the manufacturing absorption costs as period costs? Or will some of that be capitalized into inventory? And will that be a drag that will just kind of sit there and be recognized through cost of goods sold in future periods? Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Sure. Yes. On the medical, I mean, let's leave it that it's positive. And that in the short term, we do sort of see that demand will still be heavy. Moving out, I think medical will be impacted, especially their beds and stretchers business. To the extent that, that's large capital and there could be liquidity issues with hospitals. On the gross margin question, you're absolutely right, the single biggest thing that will probably be a big impact in Q2 will be fixed cost absorption. And right now, we don't see that we would be capitalizing that in the balance sheet. We would only be able to capitalize to the extent we actually produce the inventory. And so you'll see that flow through the P&L, and that will be more significant and more pronounced than it certainly was in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Rajbir Denhoy : I just really had one question, just a follow-up to the earlier question on the ASC or the ambulatory surgery center side. I appreciate that the capacity there is still somewhat limited, but I think one of the trends people are hearing about with COVID is that perhaps more volume will shift there over time. And so one of the things I was curious about is if you could maybe just ground us in kind of what the pricing environment is, the profitability environment is for you guys when you sell joint into that channel. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. Right now, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospitals. Most ASCs are affiliated with hospitals. Hospitals have a partial ownership, of course, in the ASC. And they tend to buy the implants on the same price contract that we have for their hospitals. So for us, the profit profile is very similar to what we see in the hospital. Keep in mind that the biggest savings that they have, they make more money in procedures in the ASC. The surgeon usually has a part ownership, so they're very motivated. But the EBITDA of ASCs is higher than hospital, and the big reason for the -- is the savings and the facility costs. That's really why they make more money in the procedure. They don't need to drive down our implant prices to be able to drive that higher degree of profitability. Obviously, they're different kind of facilities. You have to make life easy for them in terms of buying. We've created an entire offense around the ASC that I'm really excited about. If you asked me 3 or 4, 5 years ago, I was kind of concerned about ASCs, not sure how it would be for Stryker's business. Now I'm actually believing that it's going to be a very good thing for us because we have the booms, the lights, the operating tables, the Makos, all the capital power tools, Neptune waste management, everything that they need for their surgery, we can help them, and we have the disposables and the implants. And wrapping that up in a financing solution gives us a really tremendous advantage as more and more procedures go to the ASCs. So really, as of this point, we haven't seen much in the way of severe price pressure. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter from SVB Silicon Valley. Richard Newitter : I wanted to ask on the -- any protocol changes that are happening or that you're hearing about from your customers with respect to reps and the way you deliver your implant businesses to the physicians being allowed in the ORs and the hospital. How is that going to change, if at all? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So far, we haven't really seen any change. As you know, today, many of our reps are in the hospitals, our trauma reps, our neurovascular reps. So today, and even if you think about revision surgery or oncology surgeon within joint replacement, our reps are in the operating room today, arm and arm with the medical staff doing those procedures. And so we've heard some -- there could be some testing required for our sales reps in some places. That's -- it's very, very early, making sure they have the right PPE, that they're equipped correctly to make sure that they're not transmitting the coronavirus. But other than that, we haven't heard, really, any discussion about a blocking access or limiting access. Again, it's pretty early. Hospitals are preparing their plans. But mostly what we've heard so far is PPE and are they trained. And do they know how to put the proper PPE on and potentially having some degree of testing. The same expectation that they would have for their own staff who would be attending those surgeries. Richard Newitter : Great. And then just on the big ticket capital items, I was just curious, you said no one's really canceling as right now is more a postponement. I'm curious, what are they saying that they're going to need to see as you have the conversations? What do they need to see to potentially resume their decision-making process? And are you getting the sense these are 6- to 12-month delays or truly just indefinite? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think they're temporary delays. I don't think they're indefinite. Look, there's a lot of uncertainty right now. They don't know if they're going to get a bolus of new patients for coronavirus. And the hospitals that are, let's say, New Jersey, New York, those that are at the epicenter or even Detroit, they lose a lot of money while their hospitals are not having elective surgery and while they're treating coronavirus patients. So obviously, the first $30 billion has been doled out to the hospitals. The next $30 billion is coming. The general allocation method didn't provide extra money to those patients, those hospitals that were treating coronavirus patients. $10 billion of the next $30 billion is going to be disproportionately pushed to those hospitals. So waiting to receive the money and seeing how much each hospital get is very important to their overall liquidity profile. And then as they resume elective surgeries, as I mentioned earlier, that is really going to help shore up their financial situation. And so that's what they're waiting for. If the governors declare delays in the elective surgery ramp, their financial situation deteriorates, just like ours does. And so that's the -- that uncertainty has to be sort of lifted. And even if they're not back to 100%, if they're back doing elective procedures and they have some line of sight to financial stability, then they'll be inclined to start to make those purchases because they do want to differentiate themselves. They do want to deliver great service to their customers. And so it's just the uncertainty around their financial stability and their liquidity, which is -- which they're waiting to resolve. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : Katherine, congratulations. I have two questions that are related. How do you think about the recovery in the procedures that have been postponed? Another management team thought that maybe 0% to 15% would come back in the back half of this year. Can you comment on that? And then big picture in your portfolio, which ones of your procedures come back first? Kevin Lobo : I'm not sure I got the first part, Joanne, 0% to 15% of procedures... Joanne Wuensch : Those procedures that have been delayed. So if you had 100 procedures that have been delayed in the month of April or March, what percentage of them come back this year or next year or ever? Kevin Lobo : I think in our -- in the procedures that we operate in, virtually all of these procedures come back. I mean these are -- osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition. These people are going to need these procedures. And so I would expect that they would come back, at least in hips and knees and spine. What we're seeing a little bit in the stroke area, which is kind of sad, is a lot of patients are afraid of going to the ER. And so we thought that, that would be largely protected, just like trauma cases. That's actually not true. And so they're not -- they're actually suffering with strokes at home. And so part of that is actually elective, which I would never have guessed. As they get more comfort and as the incident rates and death rates start or continue to decline, which they're doing in many locations, they'll start to get more comfortable going to the ER, and you'll see that volume resume. But to me, 0% to 15% seems like a historically low number. We would expect a lot more to come back. What I can't predict is how fast will they come back. Joanne Wuensch : I'm sorry, that 0% to 15% had to do with those coming back in 2020. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Again, I believe, to me, that seems awfully low. I mean, with the surgeon surveys that are surgeons in hospitals that I've spoken to, the patients that are on the waiting lists, they're not -- they don't want to leave the waiting list, they would like to get their procedures done. But the big wild card is just how deep is this recession and how -- if there are more layoffs, will those people get their procedures. Those are things I can't predict. But to me, that sounds low in my view. Again, I don't have a crystal ball. But that sounds awfully low to me. I don't know, Katherine, if you'd want to add anything? Katherine Owen : No, I agree, Kevin. It's -- I think we just have to wait and see how it plays out if this is a V or a U-shaped recovery. It has different implications. But I don't think we could give any more granularity or specificity. Joanne Wuensch : And then of your procedures, which ones come back first. Kevin Lobo : Again, I can't really answer that because it really depends on the locations, the hospitals. Are they equipped. Can they have a separate facility that's separate from their coronavirus patients. If they can, they'll do whatever procedures they've got the equipment for in those ORs. So for us, I'm hearing a lot of pent-up demand certainly in the orthopaedic side. Those -- a lot of those physicians are not employed by hospitals. They might have an affiliation with the hospital, but they're not employed and they are eager -- I would say, very eager to get back to work. And they are very lucrative procedures for hospitals. So I do believe those procedures will come back fairly quickly. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : I just want to follow-up on Raj's earlier question, and it's really around pricing. MedSurg came in positive the first time, and I think 8 quarters on pricing. And it just seems that pricing is a little less pronounced right now. And is that a function of hospitals maybe taking their foot off the gas there? And kind of what are your expectations for pricing in the back half of the year, maybe when they have a little more time to focus on it? Could we see that increase a little bit?  And then the second one is a follow-up to that. And you didn't call out pricing in spine in the press release. I'm just curious if you could comment on some of the pricing dynamics there in that segment of the market. Kevin Lobo : Sure. So first off, in terms of pricing and you think about our portfolio of businesses, generally, on the orthopaedic side, we have more pricing pressure than on the MedSurg side. And actually, even within MedSurg, if you look at some of our businesses that largely sometimes have positive pricing, medical, it would be one of those businesses.  So I would say that as you look at Q1 or you think about Q2, business mix is going to really influence where pricing is going to land. And if there's sort of less ortho and more MedSurg, I would say pricing would be a little muted. I do think, though, moving forward, the same controls and pricing, sort of procedures and functions that exist in the hospitals will always continue to exist. We have always felt pricing pressure and I don't expect that, that will let off at all. So I do think that it's not really a function of hospitals getting back to it for us. It's really going to be a function of sort of business mix within our sales line. And then on the spine front, I don't have any real specific guidance on spine pricing. I mean, spine is probably within orthopaedics. One of the most sort of price sensitive product lines that we sell. There's loads of spine companies. I would say, if anything, maybe the current environment will drive out some of the spine competitors. And so with less competitors, maybe spine pricing will level out a little bit. But it's really uncertain at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Just two quick questions. First is, just wanted to check in on development programs, particularly the Mako new indication development. Spine and extremity, I think you have talked about historically, you haven't provided time lines, but this crisis delay, any time lines, even though we don't know what they are at this point for one. And then second, just Kevin, being the Chairman of AdvaMed, any core initiatives the group is pursuing to support the med tech industry? Kevin Lobo : Sure. On the first front, I would tell you, if you look at the R&D spend we had in the first quarter, it was very much in line with our normal spend. We are not taking our foot off the gas at all with respect to our R&D pipeline, and that includes Mako and future indications. We aren't going to get specific about time lines yet because we're not really ready to do so, and we'll keep you posted, but full speed ahead with all of our R&D. As it relates to AdvaMed, yes, it's been a very busy time. I happen to be Chairman. This is my -- going to my second year of my 2-year term. And so we're on weekly calls with all of our CEOs within the industry. I would say the first big focus was ventilators, as you could probably imagine. And now the major focus is on testing because the diagnostic companies are also members of AdvaMed. And really just working with the administration and FEMA, in particular, to make sure that they have a clear supply signal and trying to get them to get the demand signal, so we can kind of have some kind of matching. And obviously, it's not our job to define the protocols for when do you do live virus testing and when is antibody testing appropriate and serology testing and what companies should do. But we're in active discussions, and I would say testing is it's moved away from ventilators.  And PPE is still a common topic that we're talking about, but much more of the focus right now has shifted to testing as governments around the world are trying to figure out and states are trying to figure out how to bring people back to work. So that's the big focus right now on testing. And it's really -- when you're part of that trade association, it really -- it makes you appreciate this industry. It's an amazing industry that does so much for people, especially in these kind of trying times. And I'm really proud of how the industry has stepped forward to really to help our customers. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Xuyang Li : This is actually young Xuyang Li for Matt. Maybe just one question. I was wondering, when it comes to your hospital customer finances, do you have a view on maybe how many of them are a little bit distressed in this environment? And how can that disrupt the recovery curve? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I don't have insights into what hospitals may be distressed. I mean my guess is that, obviously, their cash flow of most hospitals is under stress just because they don't earn as much money treating COVID patients as they might during elected procedures. I do think that between government grants, external financing, once hospitals can demonstrate positive cash flow again. And even our own programs with Flex finance, there's plenty of capital availability for hospitals. And so I think that moving forward, once things settle down and we see sort of a trajectory ahead, that a lot of those programs will kick in and allow hospitals to sort of reinstate capital buying programs. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Kyle Rose : Great. So just wanted to talk just a little bit about maybe the commercial structure, it's -- particularly with the backdrop of some of the cost changes you've discussed. Are you seeing any big picture trends with respect to changing, I guess, the support level or the requirements for what the sales rep does on a case-by-case basis. And I guess, the secondary question that's coming out of that is we've seen the potential for rep-less models or maybe there's a virtual model in the operating room. What does that do from the cost structure of what the SG&A line looks from a long-term perspective. Kevin Lobo : So look, at this point in time, we're not really seeing any change to the way our reps provide service and support our customers. I think what we're learning about virtual tools is they can be additive to our offense. The idea of completely replacing our sales reps, you know companies have tried this in the past, and it has met with pretty big failure. But I do think there is a role for technology. We are seeing a little bit of this in Japan. And so I think technology can be an additional tool in our arsenal, certainly for training. And even in terms of support that it could provide some benefits, potentially some benefits in SG&A. But I would say those are very modest at this time. It's very early. And I think as things resume, it's going to resume much more in the manner that we saw prior to coronavirus and then potentially you could see acceleration afterwards.  I think rehab, for sure, the patients are very comfortable going home and trying to do their rehab at home and using virtual tools. I think you're going to see a lot more of that. There has been some movement. That's increasing. I think the surgeon consultations that used to occur in surgeon offices, that's going to be a lot more virtual, that's happening now. And certainly, the payers are a lot more comfortable paying for that, which they weren't before. But as it relates to the nuts and bolts of our procedures in the operating room, I don't see any dramatic change at this time. Kyle Rose : Just 1 follow-up on a pricing perspective. I appreciate the earlier commentary around spine. I just -- you talked a lot about physicians in hospitals coming under financial distress. Just -- are there any expectations for potentially some increased price pressure, specifically when you think about the recon side of the business? Kevin Lobo : We haven't seen any sort of step change impetus for price change within implants. And this has been going on for some time. Certainly, our prices go down every year. They have moderated. There really isn't -- this is not a new impetus to drive significantly reduced pricing. And so I don't expect -- I think our price outlook will stay very similar moving forward. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : As I said in my opening remarks, I would like to once again thank the frontline health care professionals and first responders for everything that they have done and continue to do. I'm also proud of the efforts of our employees who are showing great resiliency in continuing to serve our customers in this difficult time. Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As we begin today's call, I would like to start by thanking all our employees for their continued commitment to ensuring the safety of their colleagues, their families, and our customers. I'm very pleased with the resiliency of our organization, which has maintained high employee engagement and customer connections through the pandemic, from our sales forces who remain present and essential to the doctors and caregivers they support, to our manufacturing teams that have worked around the clock to optimize supply with ever-changing demand, and across our workforce, most of whom continue to collaborate virtually, the Stryker's spirit remains alive and well. Our second quarter sales declined organically by 24%, reflecting the impacts of COVID-19 across all geographies and the majority of our product lines. The results reflect progressive improvement in overall sales through the quarter, but do vary by region. The sequential improvement can be tied to the initial cancellation and subsequent gradual return elective procedures during the quarter. As mentioned in our first quarter call, we took aggressive steps early on to ensure the safety of our employees and customers while managing discretionary spending across our P&L in response to the slowdown in sales. Our cost containment measures included significant reductions in travel and meetings, a slow down in hiring, and salary reductions across senior leaders. In addition, we made other efforts to focus on cash conservation, including the idling of select product lines and facilities across our network starting in May. These actions combined with our sales performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64, a decline of nearly 68% versus the prior year. As we look at the quarter, the low point in sales occurred in April, and then improved sequentially through the end of June. As a reminder, implants and disposables represent about 75% of our sales, and small capital represents 16%. Small capital generally mirrors the performance and trends of implants and disposables. The largest improvements within the quarter were in hips, knees, spine trauma, sports medicine, and neurotechnology, reflecting the resumption of electric procedures, and the gradual opening of previously locked down communities and geographies. With respect to our large capital businesses, Medical Capital and Mako were standouts, both posting strong growth to the quarter. Our Mako Robotic technology remains in high demand with our customers, despite any financial constraints resulting from the pandemic. By geography, Japan and Canada performed well, while Europe, China, and Australia showed progressive improvements through the quarter. In contrast, Latin America and India continue to be weaker as the impacts of COVID-19 remain more widespread in those regions. In Q3, we expect the recovery to continue, but do not expect it to be linear, while local governments deal with varying degrees of resurgences. Our R&D programs continue to proceed despite logistical challenges caused by the pandemic, and we spent at a healthy rate in the quarter. We are actively engaging with our customers, while ensuring that our product supplies in a strong position to capitalize as procedures resume. However, given the fluid nature of this situation, we are not providing Q3 or full-year guidance. We are proceeding with the integration efforts regarding the Wright Medical transaction. We are working cooperatively with the regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for the transaction, and including as previously announced proposing to divest our STAR total ankle replacement product. This process is well underway and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority recently announced that it will consider our proposed undertakings in lieu of a Phase 2 investigation. We continue to expect to close the transaction around the end of Q3 or beginning of Q4. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical, or the pending transaction on today's call. This has been the most unique situation that most of us have ever experienced. While we have been impacted financially as a result of the government shutdowns and deferrals of elective procedures, this time has also allowed us opportunities to reevaluate and develop new ways to work and collaborate across our diverse group of businesses. We are prepared to emerge from the pandemic as stronger, more efficient company. I remain confident in our people, our culture, and our ability to partner with our customers to meet the needs of the many patients they serve. And now over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment and how certain countries and products performed during the quarter. We saw progressive improvement in sales throughout the quarter, with April being the low point. The improving trends were primarily driven by the resumption of elective procedures. That momentum is continuing into Q3 as July is trending better than June. We estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of our total global revenue includes procedures that are considered elective, or more accurately and be in many cases deferred for a period of time. This primarily includes hips and knees, extremities, spine, sports medicine, and our ENT business. Geographically, elective procedure recovery varied depending on the government action and severity of the pandemic. In addition to the U.S., countries like China, Australia, and Germany have also shown month-to-month improvements as elective procedures returned during the quarter, reaching approximately 85% to 90% of pre-COVID levels. The U.K., India, and Latin America lagged during the quarter at less than 50% of pre-COVID levels, as the pandemic continues to spread in these countries. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our large capital products, specifically beds and stretchers within our medical division, and ongoing high demand for our Mako robotics technology. In the second quarter, we were very pleased with the Mako installations in the U.S., including increased sales to ASU and competitive accounts. We continue to see a growing percentage of both hip and knee replacement surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. As it relates to knee, there's an ongoing shift towards the metals. We also launched a new software upgrade for the Mako Hip program. That includes features, which improve the overall ease of use. Our leadership in orthopedic robotics, a strong order book, and a solid innovation pipeline positions us well to see continued above market growth in joint replacement. While we have made meaningful reductions and many discretionary spend items, our investment in R&D remains robust, as does our healthy cadence of new product introductions. During the first-half of the year, we are pleased with the customer feedback and results from several new products, some of which include spine [diagonal] [ph] lateral system, mini-frag plating and trauma, and Neurovascular Vecta 71 and 74 intermediate catheters. These and other launches will contribute to our performance for the rest of the year and position us well for the future. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in elective procedures, it has also placed increased emphasis on the safety of healthcare providers and their patients. Over the years, we have built an extensive portfolio within our MedSurg businesses, addressing many of the challenges our customers face with the focus on accident, and infection prevention, and caregiver safety. This includes product just like our patient hygiene and disinfecting products, personal protective equipment, waste management and smoke evacuation devices along with the LUCAS chest compression system, which delivers high-quality automated CPR, while reducing the proximity of the caregiver to the patient. With the ongoing threat of COVID-19 infections, the Department of Defense identified automated compression devices, such as the LUCAS device as the best practice for delivery of CPR. Demand for these patients grew during the quarter in response to these increased safety concerns. We will continue to leverage our diverse portfolio to address changing trends and meet the expectations of our customers, caregivers, and patients. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results, related drivers, and liquidity matters. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 24% in the quarter. These results included a decline in the U.S. to 27.4%, and an international decline of 14.5%. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as compared to Q2, 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.2% from the prior quarter, and foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.8% impact on sales. During the quarter, our growth was significantly negatively impacted by reductions in elective surgeries, the effects of shelter in place orders across many geographies, and the pause in hospital capital spending as the medical community navigates this pandemic. Throughout the quarter, we saw progressive improvement in the expansion of elective surgeries across many geographies, which resulted in significant variability in our sales. On an overall basis, our sales declined range from minus 36% in April, to minus 10% in June. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $0.64 represents a decline of 67.7% from Q2 2019. The foreign currency impact on second quarter EPS was minimal. Certain other factors resulted in disproportionately negative impacts on EPS including the loss of higher margin sales and a loss of leverage related to manufacturing and operational fixed costs. These were partially offset by our strong focus on disciplined cost control within the quarter. I will now provide some brief comments on segment sales. Orthopedics has constant currency and organic sales decline of 29.3%. This included a U.S. decline of 28.8%. We saw declines across our hip, knee, and trauma businesses. We also saw very strong growth in our Mako business somewhat offset by declines in [indiscernible]. Internationally orthopedics had an organic decline of 30.4%, which reflects the downturn in electric procedures across most geographies. MedSurg had constant currency decline of 16.4% and organic sales decline of 17%, which included a 22.2% decline in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales decline of 38%, driven by power tools, waste management, and surg account. This was partially offset by increases in the instruments, PPE products, namely our plain helmet and other protective products. As a reminder, instruments also had a very high comparable in Q2, 2019 with 19% growth. Endoscopy at U.S. organic sales decline of 34.1%, this reflects a slowdown in its video general surgery, communications, and sports medicine businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 5.4%, reflecting strong demand across it's bad and emergency care businesses, resulting from demand tied to COVID-19, which was offset by declines in stage, related to less patient slum. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 4.6%, reflecting strong demand for products in Australia, Canada, Europe, and emerging markets. neurotechnology and spine had a constant currency decline of 28.9% and an organic decline of 29.9%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted a constant currency decline of 36.4% and a 37.5% organic decline for the quarter. This reflects a slowdown in procedures in the quarter related to all our neurotech businesses. The decline was most pronounced in our ENT neurosurgical and CMF businesses. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had an organic decline of 13%, reflecting slowdowns in Europe, Canada, and emerging markets, which was offset by a solid performance in our neurovascular business. Now I will discuss operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 57.3% was unfavorable 850 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by fixed cost absorption and business mix. The fixed cost absorption was significant and related to certain costs associated with idle manufacturing that normally would be capitalized into inventory. During Q2, we operated at 60% of normal capacity and the related unabsorbed costs diluted our margin by approximately 400 basis points. We anticipate Q3 will be at an average capacity of approximately 85%, unabsorbed costs will continue to impact our margin until our manufacturing is operating at normal levels. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 37.1% of sales, which was 360 basis points unfavorable to the prior-year quarter. Compared to the prior-year, SG&A was unfavorably impacted by business mix and de-leveraging of selling and marketing costs partially offset by operating expense savings actions taken during the quarter. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 12.5% of sales. The measures we enacted in March, covering most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consulting, as well as the idling of certain manufacturing lines and facilities including furloughing the related workers continued throughout the second quarter. Related to other income and expense as compared to prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.4%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of $6.6 billion, including $4.6 billion related to Wright Medical funding and generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was ahead of our internal targets. This reflects earnings and a reduction in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable during the quarter. As I noted in January, we did not repurchased any shares in Q1 nor do we plan to do so the remainder of the year. The actions that we implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q2, and included discretionary spending controls, reduction in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable and slowing M&A activities. Concerning our cash holdings and available credit lines, from a liquidity standpoint, we continue to be well positioned. We currently have available credit lines, none of which are drawn on at this time of approximately $3 billion. In addition, our investment grade credit rating supports good access to the capital markets and we have taken advantage of historically low rates to execute additional funding in the quarter of approximately $2.3 billion for the Wright Medical transaction. As it relates to this transaction, we estimate completing the required funding in the third quarter with the execution of up to an additional $1 billion. In terms of other future capital requirements, our quarterly dividend is approximately $215 million and we have one $300 million bond maturity due in Q4. As it relates to guidance for Q3 and the full-year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. We will continue to evaluate operating circumstances and the market environment for stability prior to reinstitution of guidance. And now I will open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first call comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. I'm sorry. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes, we can Bob. Bob Hopkins : Great. Hey, Kevin and Preston, thanks for taking the question. First question is, if I heard you correctly, this June revenues were down 10% for the whole company. Can you give me a sense as to how variable the growth was within divisions for June? I'm sure folks would love to hear kind of how hips and knees did in June relative to that 10%. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Sure, Bob. This is Glenn. I think in general, we are not giving specific guidance, but that minus 10% is directionally correct across most of our businesses, and then we fully expect to see continued momentum moving into July. Bob Hopkins : Okay. So, that was the right number. Okay. And then, one other thing I'd add rather just in terms of thinking about the rest of the year, and appreciate you don't have guidance here, but most Medtech companies have offered up some comments on Q4 that suggests they think a reasonable first [cut at] [ph] Q4 is that they might be up a little bit, or down a little bit on the year, plus or minus zero is kind of what we are hearing from a lot of your peers. I know you're not giving full guidance, but is there any reason to think that Stryker might be way outside of that band is to the positive or the negative, given what you are seeing in your business? Kevin Lobo : Bob, there's a reason we're not giving guidance, right, because we just don't know what's going to happen in the future, but there isn't any reason to think that there's something widely different about our business. We performed slightly better than the market, 100 to 200 basis points on top line we've done it for eight years in a row. You should expect us to continue to have the same type of performance, and it really does depend on what the market does, and once we have a better visibility we'll give guidance, but there's nothing unique about our business that would cause us to be widely out of line. Bob Hopkins : Okay, thanks for that. I appreciate it. Operator : And pardon the interruptions as we work through a few logistics. And your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple for me here, one on Capital One strategic, for Kevin; so Kevin, just on the broader capital environment, I'm just curious, you did a distinction this afternoon of small capital versus large capital. Why don't you just give us a sense of how you see the capital environment, how hospitals are reacting to the CARES Act? I think a lot of investors are concerned about significant volatility or lack of demand for certain types of products, maybe you could help us with sort of small capital, large capital, with maybe some emphasis on -- the bed business is very strong, specifically strong internationally, and how durable you see that business? And I have a quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Okay, great. Well, so first of all, starting off with the CARES Act, so $175 billion that's been authorized to go to hospitals, only $115 billion has actually been disbursed. So, there's still another $60 billion to be disbursed, and that's prior to the next round of legislation, right. The next stimulation package will add to that, and so, money is flowing to the hospitals. We are really pleased with the performance of medical, obviously. Small capital tends not to be as much of a worry. They needed to do the procedures. So, that's why it tends to trend very, very closely with elective procedures. They need power tools to do the knee replacement. They need the cameras to do the general surgery products. So, that tends never to be really hit too much. It's more of a large capital that tends to be the constraint, but because of the coronavirus, a lot of our large capital in terms of beds and structures were actually necessary, and we saw those being purchased. Mako was really a pleasant surprise in the quarter to see the amount of robots we're able to install. There was more financing than normal, I would say in the second quarter, as hospitals tried to conserve as much short-term [caches] [ph] as they could, but it's hard to predict how this is going to play out over the course of the year, I would say for now, we're feeling very good about the state of our businesses. Internationally, we had a terrific performance out of medical, and a lot of that is governments around the world really saying this is really important to have LUCAS, chest compression devices, very important to have ICU beds, et cetera, and so, we had just a terrific performance. We also don't have stages as a much smaller business for medical outside the United States. So, that weighed heavily on our U.S. performance. We actually had strong medical capital in the United States as well, but we're feeling very good about the state of the capital business. It's not like the last time where you didn't have this kind of stimulation from the government to tickle going directly into hospitals, and hospitals are very motivated to increase their procedures. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful. And then, Kevin, as we head into next year, you seem very committed to the Wright Medical transaction. So, as we head into '21, your Stryker's balance sheet will be the most levered it's been in the most recent memory certainly. So, one of the hallmarks of the business has been the ability to be flexible and go after growth-oriented M&A, and you've been one of the two top most active acquirers in large cap Medtech. So, how should investors think about your ability to do deals in '21 and beyond for '21 and '22, and should they all be concerned about the inability to do deals having an impact on the growth rate over the next couple of years? Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thank you. So, clearly, we'll be at a high leverage point, and we do have intentions to start paying down that debt, but we haven't stopped our business development teams. They're still out looking at targets. I would expect that they won't be much necessarily as large as some of the targets we've done more recently, but you should expect us to continue to be busy with bolt-on type of acquisitions, and as you saw, we had a really strong performance in cash flow in the second quarter, as we generate cash we'll be able to both pay down debt and stay busy in the M&A market. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup. Joanne Wuensch : Hi, everybody. Two questions; the first one is, is there a particular segment that you see recovering faster than others, and the second question really is, as you look into next year, help me understand how to think about the financial model and some sense of normalcy? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Well, I think we were pretty clear in the opening comments that our businesses really recover with the recovery of surgery, and so, as surgeries come back, all of our businesses are sort of resuming at a very similar pace. We don't have huge variability, I would say early on in the pandemic ENT because it was aerosolizing procedures are clearly the hardest hit, and then the hips and knees were sort of next hardest hit, but I would say, now as the economies reopening, we're really getting a nice uptick across full portfolio. There really isn't that much variability as it relates to the elective procedures. Capital is a little bit different. So, in large capital area, the booms and lights and that type of capital wasn't as robust as beds and stretchers and Mako. So, there is some variability, but again, not too dramatic, and so, I think you're going to see our business kind of come back as the economy comes back in a fairly synchronous manner. And I wasn't quite sure I got your question about next year's financial model. Joanne, do you mind repeating that? Joanne Wuensch : Sure. I'm just trying to look past this year in some ways, because investors are evaluating stocks on '21 and in some cases, '22, and so, I'm just trying to think of how do you think about next year, and it could be qualitatively or quantitatively? Kevin Lobo : Glenn, I think you are muted. Glenn Boehnlein : Hey, sorry, Joanne, I was muted. I gave you a great answer, though. Joanne Wuensch : I read it all down. You're good. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hey. So, Joanne, I'll speak qualitative to 2021. We're not really looking to guide just yet and expect that that will happen after we have our Q4 earnings call, but as we think about next year, we do think that there will be a progressive recovery more optimistic based on what we see right now, and so, that will obviously play forward into 2021. From a cost structure standpoint, we are sort of experiencing sort of new ways of working and being more virtual and obviously saving on travel and other things, and I think there will be lots of examples of how that might play into our operating structure in the future. We currently have a whole taskforce made up of our senior leadership team that's really looking at [technical difficulty] and how we might come back. So, I fully expect that as we look at our financial model and our operating structure for next year, we'll expect to see sort of the impact of some of that. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I had one, one follow-up on Mako and robotic surgery. Kevin, you'd mentioned a couple of times the strength in the quarter, and we rewind back to the beginning of Q2, I think there were questions as to how inactive hospitals will be in bringing in new systems, and it sounds like it's kind of a much stronger. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the mix or the regional aspects of the strength and how you're pushed into ASCs, the sort of ASC offering strategy is playing into that? And I have one follow-up on spine? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure, Matt. We're not going to get into specific numbers as we stopped providing that, as you know a couple of quarters ago, but I would tell you that we had slightly higher competitive placements than we had typically before, and a bit more activity in the ASCs and we've been selling to the ASCs before, so that's not new, but clearly, there's an accelerating trend towards the ASCs, it was already starting to ramp and I think the pandemic is causing that to increase further. Keep in mind, there's only about 5% to 10% of joint replacement procedures done in ASC, so even though the ramp is picking up, it's going to take time before it becomes a very meaningful portion of procedures, but I would say those are the two areas that were higher than normal, which ASC is in competitive accounts. And then, what I tell you is overall I was pleasantly surprised you know, not knowing how hospitals are going to react. Our team did an awesome job in the quarter of being able to place a lot of robots and even though some more than we're financing the normal, we're totally fine with that, that's something in front of our office for a long time, and hospitals understandably are trying to preserve their options, but the demand and the pull for Mako was very strong. The order book is also very helpful, so this isn't just a one quarter issue and that all goes very well for us as every time we push a Mako, the percent of procedures done on the robot is increasing, and it tends, especially for our knees. It tends to cause an increase in some analysts as well, so those trends are continuing to rise, so it's just lifting all about within drug replacement. Matt Miksic : Thanks, it's great to hear. And then, on the spine side, just curious if you have any color on sort of seasonality, as in summertime months typically now with [K2M] [ph] under the verge at Stryker, you know there is the kind of upswing in scoliosis surgery and wondering if you've seen that or seen any trends ASCs or strong cervical, stronger lumbar given just the challenges early in Q2. And then, how that's shaping up heading into Q3 here? Kevin Lobo : Yes, it's such a messy quarter honestly with I think all the closings that are happening and shutdowns, but scoliosis obviously is seasonal every year, and that's one of the crown jewels of the K2M portfolio, is there a complex deformative system, but there's nothing unusual that I want to call out and because there's so much noise, it's really hard for us to parse it out. There's just a lot of noise and as a it relates to ASCs. Obviously, spinal procedures are done in ASCs, it's not giant today, I think that will increase in the same way that it's increasing in large time procedures. Matt Miksic : Fair enough. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on solid executions there. Glenn, maybe the first one for you, I think, I heard some comments around capacity utilization on that manufacturing side being at 60% in 2Q stepping up to 85% in 3Q. One, I want to make sure I heard those numbers correct and in the implication on the gross margin side, it's implication that you step up by a couple of 100 basis points because now you're absorbing manufacturing variances better? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, hi, Vijay. Yes, you actually, you heard those numbers right. Capacity was around 65%, on average for Q2. And we actually do see it stepping up on an average to about 85% in Q3, but in Q2 it was about 400 basis points impact in terms of sort of fixed period costs that we had the expense as a result of some of those idlings. You could probably do the math on that number, relative to the 85% in Q3 and come pretty close to what we anticipate the amount will be. Keep in mind though that we're forecasting where we think the ramp might be and where it actually might be could be somewhat different and that certainly would impact how we ramp up manufacturing. Vijay Kumar : I was about to say the step up and not capacity as a proxy for revenues, but thanks for clarifying that. I -- Kevin, I have one for you, if I had to get two months without a setup pricing is going to be quite bad. This is really remarkable pricing is faking out, how much of this is a function of perhaps bear discipline on your part in the industry in general, or is there something else going on in the industry? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. We've been focused on price for a long time, as you've seen over the past couple of years, the pricing overall has moderated within our overall portfolio. So part of it is certainly our efforts, and part of it's just a stable environment, the pricing environment has been fairly stable for some period of time and obviously our portfolio also has evolved over time, and with our portfolio being a higher percentage of MedSurg relative to the total and really some great discipline showing in some of our divisions. If I look at our CMF business as an example there's just terrific price discipline, and a lot of great innovations that we've been launching that. That continued to demand good prices, and so, we're going to continue to focus on that and we continue to expect a pretty stable pricing environment going forward. Vijay Kumar : Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Robbie Marcus : Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could spend a minute on two areas that the straight numbers by a good amount, neurotech and instruments, and I was wondering if you could add any extra commentary, I know I guess people weren't taking into account, how much some of the ENT might have been down in the quarter, but any other color you could add on instruments and neurotech and the trends there. Obviously, related to COVID, but just any color you could add? Kevin Lobo : Okay. Sure, I'll take the neurotech part and then I'll -- maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment on instruments. So, within neurotech, we have four businesses, so we have our neurovascular business, our cranial maxillofacial business, our neurosurgery business, which is think about the neuro powered instruments and our portfolio of neurosurgical products and ENT. So within those four businesses, a lot of neurovascular is the largest on a global basis, but it's very, it's more heavily weighted to your -- to outside the United States. So roughly 60% of their sales are all U.S. So in the U.S., you have a much higher waiting on ENT, CMF and neurosurgical all three of which obviously were heavily impacted by the pandemic. Neurovascular was less impacted by the pandemic. Conversely, those three businesses don't have a very high percentage of their sales outside the United States. So when you're looking at a neurotech basket. You can see that impact in international being much better -- having much better performance than in the United States, just given the mixes of those businesses, but that's I think perhaps why a lot of times when speaking to investor, sometimes they sort of simplify that neurovascular is the neurotech business, but it's really just one of the core businesses, and ENT was the most heavily impacted business of all of the business of Stryker given the aerosolized and procedures. And then, Glenn do you want comment on that? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure, sure. On instruments, you know, they primarily have two very large segments, one of those being orthopedic solutions, which is powered instruments that are primarily used in orthopedic procedures. And then, the other surgical technologies, which has our safety products, our waste management products, you know obviously the orthopedic solutions scaled downward with just the elective procedure drop offs in orthopedics. On the surgical technology front, I would tell you that. Yes, I watched some of their equipment was significantly down there you know, personal protective equipment and products that relate to that did very well. I would also tell you that, and I suddenly said this in my earnings script that last year instruments grew almost 19% in the quarter. And so, it was a very, very high comparable and bar that they would have to overcome to even come close to growth and I think you see that impact in the decline they had for the quarter. Robbie Marcus : Appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up, you guys spend a billion dollars in R&D and have a very active pipeline. We've heard from some of the cardio names that have bigger trials with longer timelines that they're seeing about six month's delays. The R&D is down modestly in second quarter, how should we think about any potential delays to the pipeline, if at all at Stryker? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I wouldn't expect much in the way of delays. Some of the reasons for the lower spending is just access to labs to do testing, and so, the pandemic did crimp us a little bit, but very modestly, and keep in mind that we really only have two divisions that have PMA products on neurovascular division and our Physio-Control business. And PMA products are the ones that really do demand those clinical trials. And we just have launched a series of terrific products within neurovascular. So we actually have an innovation pipeline that that has is very, very healthy and refreshed within neurovascular. We weren't on the cusp of something brand-new. In fact, we had some really great news in the last quarter on some new approvals. Our surpass evolved, which is our newer flow diverting stent was approved in the United States. Our original flow diverting stent streamline was approved in China and our Atlas stent was also approved in China. So that was all good news, but don't expect much in the way of delays. Our product pipelines continue to march ahead. And I think the makeup of our business being much more 510(k) gives us the ability to continue to launch products at a very healthy pace. Robbie Marcus : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum from SunTrust. Kaila Krum : Great. Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking our questions tonight. So I know you're not going to talk about the STAR divestiture process, but I think you sit in a pretty interesting spot right now just having the perspective of a company trying to divest a business, but also opening -- open to evaluating tuck-ins at this time. So I just would be curious if you could comment high level on the M&A market today. What you're seeing in terms of just deal volume, potential sellers and buyer pool in this market, just as compared with perhaps what you had seen a year ago? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think, the pandemic caused a slowdown clearly, a lot of activity got slowed down. We slowed down our own activities to some degree, continue to evaluate targets, but put a pause because obviously we were in sort of cash conservation mode, not knowing how long is this going to go on for, but I would say that our DD teams are just as busy as ever, engaging with targets, and I think this will come back just as it always has in the past. There are still a lot of companies within MedTech, a lot of small -- smaller and innovative companies, and we're going to continue to be busy. The divestiture process relates to the regulatory process for the deal. And we're going to continue to stay active on the BD front. Obviously, as I mentioned before, we're taking on a lot of depths with this Wright Medical acquisition, and so, part of our commitment with cash is going to be to pay down some of the debt, but it won't be exclusively and we've told that we will continue to stay active on M&A, but it will be obviously smaller tuck-in type of deals for the near-term. Kaila Krum : Great. Thanks, Kevin. And then I just would like to touch about on vendor consolidation. Obviously, vendor consolidation has been a trend over time, but I'd love to hear if you're seeing any uptick in that more recently. Is it coming up more often in conversations with your hospital customers? Or is it just kind of more of the same at this point? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I'd say it's more -- a bit more of the same at this point. Hospitals are have been looking to consolidate vendors by service lines. We actually embrace that approach because we're very, very deep in each of our service lines and category leaders in the segments that we plan. We are seeing with our ASC offense that having everything that ASC needs, whether it's blooms and lights and operating tables to make robots as well as implants, it really does give us a terrific position in ASC. So, that's an area of strength, but I would say overall not much change. Kaila Krum : Great, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, you know, I appreciate the negative 10% growth in June and the improving commentary for July. I just want to give you a chance to comment on this. I assume people come off this call thinking that Q3 should be better than that negative 10% in June given the July trend. Is that -- are you guys comfortable with that without saying whether you'll grow or not, but Q3 should be better than down 10%? Kevin Lobo : Well, certainly, if the current marketplace continues, it will be much better obviously because July is trending better than June as we mentioned, but as long as we don't have an outbreak or have to go back to shelter-in-place, as long as this trend line continues where we're feeling good about Q3. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then did that improvement in July also applied to the U.S.? And if so, you know, qualitatively, how are hospitals in the U.S. dealing with the spikes that we're all obviously seeing here? Thanks for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Yes, it certainly includes the United States, and obviously, our business is more heavily weighted to the U.S. And so as that U.S. recovery improves that certainly is terrific for Stryker. Even in Florida today, we're seeing hospitals continuing to do surgeries. And so that -- it's not as if we were -- we're going through what we went through in April. Hospitals for the most part have been pretty well equipped. They are segregating their COVID patients from the areas where they can do surgery. I'm not saying that universally, some hospitals in Arizona, they chose to close elective surgeries down for a week. We saw that, but then they resumed a week after. So I think this notion of complete shutdowns, I don't think we're going to see that unless we have some type of rampant change in the way the virus is mutating and spreading. So, I don't expect that. I think we will have flare ups. And the reason we don't want to give guidance is it's hard to predict the nature of those flare ups and how big those flare ups will be, but even today in the -- in Texas and in Florida and in Arizona surgeries are going on, and that gives us cause for optimism for -- certainly for Q3 and beyond. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just have a question regarding some of the -- I guess, charges that you took in the quarter for in process asset impairment. It sounds that you guys were suspending some investments. I'm just wondering what exactly, I guess, are you suspending if there are any sort of projects that R&D projects or anything like that that are noteworthy just to explain? And then I noticed that you guys were taking some additional charges related to -- I'm not sure if they're just the European MDR or if they're related to any sort of quality system improvement, is there anything there worth mentioning just from how long, I guess, you anticipate taking these charges? And just any update on kind of cash flows for the rest of the year. Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Okay, Kristen, I will try to cover both of those in one fell swoop here. So you're right in the non-GAAP table, you can see that we recorded charges of about $170 million, and they were related to in-process asset impairments, product lines, and just sort of some other exit costs that that really resulted from our decision to suspend certain investments due to pandemic related constraints. I would tell you that the lion's share of those costs and those in-process costs were related to our 2020 ERP implementation, which we pause as a result of the pandemic. And really just in accordance with kind of the accounting rules and due to all the uncertainties of the situation, we were unsure of what the restart date would be of our ERP project at this time. And so thus we impaired some of those related in-process costs that had been previously capitalized. And then, on the other questions, yes, we continue to have costs that are related to EU MDR. And we'll have those flowing into next year that are just like everyone else of our peers are recorded in our non-GAAP charges and we expected that program will likely continue for about three years, and then on the cash flow front, we -- I think if you look at our cash flow, we just -- for the quarter it just really reflected good working capital performance. You combine strong collections with relatively flat inventories. We continue to work with our vendors on payment terms, and then all of that was just complimented by just the discretionary spending controls as well as measured CapEx spend, and I think all of that combined to produce a really positive cash flow result for the quarter. Kristen Stewart : Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Rick Wise : Good afternoon, Kevin. Kevin Lobo : Good afternoon. Rick Wise : You have said in your opening comments something like we're prepared to emerge from the pandemic, a stronger, more efficient company, and I obviously see no reason to doubt that and you're highlighting cutting discretionary spend, et cetera, focusing on the pipeline, but I'm just curious what that means in your mind? And what -- how we should hear you? Are you saying -- Rick, as we get -- or to all of us -- are -- as we get back to a more normal procedure environment, we're going to grow as we did, and our margins are going to be what they were? Or are you saying something more that you're trying to position the company to grow even faster with even better margins because you're taking special actions, special initiatives to plan for that? Do you see what I'm asking? Kevin Lobo : Well, I know exactly what you're asking and my CFO on my preceding screen is waving his head saying, please don't give guidance. So Rick, what I would tell you, I'll give you some qualitative commentary. So the qualitative commentary is what the pandemic has provided us has really shown us how effective we can be without having to be the high cost, high travel company we've been historically. We were a very high touch culture. We're realizing that there's a lot that we can do virtually that will be permanent. There's a lot of education, the MedEd, something that you have to do in person in cadaver lab type, but there's others that you don't. You can do very, very effectively and efficiently virtually the buildings and facilities that we have. A lot of we're going to embrace flexible work arrangements going forward, and we are not going to need the same real-estate by any stretch that we have today, and a lot of our CapEx over the past few years has been on office buildings and because of our growth and all the headcount we've been adding and all the companies we've been acquiring. And frankly, we're seeing a big change and what's going to be required in the future. So those are all areas on the efficiency front. And what I would tell you is this pandemic has shrunk our company. Our divisions are collaborating more than ever. And I think the nature of the pandemic has caused our divisions to work more together, and that's sort of one of the untapped assets of Stryker's as we collaborate, we're seeing it with our ASC offense. We're seeing it with the 3D printing. We're seeing it with sort of technology areas where different divisions can tap into enabling technologies as an example, and we're collaborating better than we ever have before, and I think that will continue once we go back to let's say some more normal environment. And it's really unleashing a different kind of potential. So I can't put a fine point on numbers related to this, Rick, but I am feeling a tremendous momentum in the company and the culture is very strong, and these changes are going to make us better as an organization going forward. How we use out those efficiencies that we regenerate? It certainly gives us more confidence and we'll get back to the nice soft margin expansion you saw with the past couple of years. That gives us tremendous confidence. We can continue that, but I think there's some untapped potential in our divisions and through collaboration that we're going to start to see manifest itself in our results. Rick Wise : Interesting. And Kevin, just a last one for me, we haven't maybe focused a ton on this call on international. You've spent amount of time rethinking Europe over the years. You highlighted that Latin America, India so weak. We haven't touched much on China. Can you give us just at a high level, what you're feeling good about, what you're feeling concerned about as we think about the recovery? Or what initiatives you have underway there just your high level thoughts internationally right now? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So first of all, I would start off with the developed countries internationally. I feel very strong about that, strong about Japan, Australia, Canada, Europe. I mean, we are really in great position in all the developed markets, even Korea feel very, very strong about our position in developed markets. Emerging markets is the big area of opportunity for Stryker over the next 5, 10 years. I feel very good about the leaders we put in place. We put in terrific leaders in our major priority countries, whether it's China, India, Turkey, Latin America, for sure just fantastic leaders, and we had a terrific year in 2019. We grew roughly 20% in the emerging markets and it was outstanding. And we were really heading into this year with the wind at our backs. Unfortunately, the pandemic has thrown a huge wrench into that. When we talked about the problems in India and the problems in Latin America, they're really not Stryker problems. They're pandemic related challenges that we have. I am expecting us to get back into the winning spirit that we had towards the end of the last year, and I feel that because we have the right leadership in place. We have the right kind of models in place. We've gone a little bit more direct in some countries. Turkey is a good example where we bought our distributor. So I do think we have the right infrastructure and it took us time, right? You remember a lot four or five years ago, we were struggling in many of those countries. And -- but I do feel we're on a solid footing and we will recover as those markets recover related to this pandemic. Rick Wise : Thanks again. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Patrick Bartoski : Good afternoon, guys. This is Patrick on from Matt. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one for us, I just would love to go back to the financing from Mako specifically. I'm curious about the Flex Financial program. I know as more ASCs acquire Mako systems, you talked about this being an important element for those placements, but have larger hospitals been using the Flex Financial program as well? And -- or are you actually finding that things are operating on a more ad hoc basis when it comes to some of these financing agreements you've been having with systems? Any color there would be really appreciated. Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. Hi, Patrick, this is Glenn. I'll answer that. What our Flex business is as busy as it's ever been. And I would tell you that just given in the current conditions and maybe some of the uncertainties hospitals may have about their liquidity, and I think that the fact that we can use Flex Financial to sort of customize these financial options for our customers is certainly making a very big impact on those capital businesses. I would tell you that during Q2, Mako sales were quite robust and we supported our customers through a variety of financing options. And then lastly -- the last bit of color I'll say is that just, given the circumstances, we definitely are seeing a shift to financing more deals than we have historically experienced. And I fully believe that that will continue throughout the rest of this year. Patrick Bartoski : Thanks, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. Xuyang Li : Thanks. This is actually Xuyang for Matt. I guess maybe a question on Mako. I am just going back to the comments on the competitive account wins. Are you going up against the other robotics systems in the field more and more and winning directly? Or are those competitive account wins and accounts that don't currently have robotics yet? Preston Wells : This is Preston, and I'll take that one. Just as we think about where we're going and the expansion of Mako, the opportunity still exists given the penetration that that's currently we're today. I think we have opportunities all throughout. So whether they're competitive accounts that are in or out, we're really just going to all of those different accounts and trying to find areas to place Mako. Xuyang Li : Okay, great, very helpful. And I guess another question is from the sort of your visibility into surgical calendars, and maybe the type of patients that's getting procedures. I'm just trying to understand how much of the surgeries are working through the backlog versus new patients and if you have visibility into that? Thanks. Preston Wells : Yes, what I would tell you, as you think about the catch up, there was clearly as we came into the recovery, some level of patients that had previously deferred procedures that were catching up and having those procedures done. We also know that that the backlog was big, and there still are some patients that are out there that have some level of anxiety and maybe they continue to defer some of those procedures for some bit of time. I think it's important though, if you think about the products that we have and the disease states that we serve. Those disease states don't really improve over time, and so, we believe that many of those patients will return to have those procedures done at some point in time. The other thing I would say is, as this pandemic was happening, we do know that surgeons were not only cleaning and clearing through the backlog, but they were also seeing new patients, whether that was in office sometimes or through telemedicine. So, because of those things, we believe that the backlog remain strong into Q3. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Richard Newitter from Silicon Valley Bank. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to follow up on the AS -- the trends in the ASC, specifically as it relates to robotics, very, very encouraged to hear that you're seeing increased demand for Mako there, and that drove some of the placements. I guess -- I'm just curious, we've heard in the past that that robotics in the ASC setting might be a harder sell. So I looked this year, what the -- where the value proposition is resonating the strongest? And in particular, one of the things that we've heard from our competitors who are offering robotic systems and specifically saying that they're better positioned to potentially sell to the ASC relates to the CT scan or the lack -- lack of a need for a CT scan. So if you could just comment there, the extent to which that has been a barrier at all in the past and any comments that you can offer further on the receptivity in this care setting for robotics? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. The surgeons that are operating the SCs want to have the best technology, they want to be able to do the same kind of procedures they used to do in the hospital. And I would say the CT scanner, it's not been a barrier whatsoever, at least not recently, I would say when Mako was earlier on, when we were initially launching our Totalknee, we had little flare-ups here and there across the country, about getting the CT scan done, but if you want to do this, the most accurately you need them and very, very accurate scan to be able to do the procedure the best way possible. And right now, I would say it's just a whimper of a sound. We really don't hear much of anything. And frankly, there's a huge degree of interest for Mako and the ASC and that we saw that in the actual numbers in this quarter. Richard Newitter : That's helpful. And just on the topic of ASC, Kevin, appreciate the insights as to how Stryker might be uniquely positioned to serve that care setting with your diverse platform. And in fact that you're effectively deep across a variety of service lines as a one stop shop for the needs of the surgeons on the pricing side, particularly on implant pricing. Do you see the trend towards ASC is eventually having an impact on pricing, is it going to get worse and implant pricing kind of set to go downwards as an increased number of procedures performed there? Kevin Lobo : Well, I can tell you right now, we're not seeing, you saw the price numbers that we posted, and I will tell you, we're not seeing much of a difference in pricing in the ASC versus the hospital today. A lot of things really does, I think it's going to depend on the ownership structure of the ASC, is it affiliated with the hospital. I can't predict what's going to happen five years from now, ASCs run very, very profitable. Today, their EBITDAs are very healthy. They're actually, they are financially minded, and they're good business people, but -- so, our hospitals have been pushing us on price for years, and so will there be pressure from the ASC? Sure. Is it going to be unique and different? I don't really see that at least we're not seeing any signs of that right now, but we'll see how that evolves over time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Good afternoon. Thanks, Kevin and Glenn, just one question for me. I appreciate all the detail you provided in terms of the improvement, sequential improvement in procedures. I was hoping you could maybe lay out some trends into quarter and maybe even into July on what you're seeing in terms of the demand for your capital that's considered COVID essential within hospitals has done very well. In Q2, are you still seeing elevated demand? Or should we be thinking about that tapering-off as COVID is getting more under control? Thanks for taking the question. Preston Wells : Absolutely, Josh this is Preston. Just to think about you're right. I think with the COVID response for some of that margin capital, certainly saw the big uptick early in the quarter. It's hard to say given where we are and some of the continuation of flare-ups and then shift around of demand, what's really pull forward versus what's going to be the normal, but I would say as we think about that, we still see a strong order book as we exited in our capital businesses, and at this point in time, we've not seen any significant stockpiling of our capital equipment either. So I would say it's hard to tell where that's going to be as we look forward, but certainly strong throughout the quarter, second quarter. Joshua Jennings : Appreciate it, thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Kyle Rose : Great, thank you for taking the question. Just one for me, very encouraged to see the strength of Mako in the quarter. And I know a lot has been asked here, but I wondered, Kevin, if you could just give us more of a higher level perspective of the orthopedic robotics market at this point. I mean are the customers you're seeing, are they still, the early adopters looking to differentiate themselves in the market? Are these purchases, more defensive because the hospital on the other side of town acquired one? And then how do you view the size of the market just from pure units that can be placed in the field, particularly given the accelerated interest from not just the hospital side, but also the ASC side? Kevin Lobo : Yes, that's a great question, predicting S-curve adoption rates or new technology. It's always a challenge, right because it's not something we do every day. It's not like launching a new power tool or launching a new camera, we can predict those curves pretty effectively. I would tell you that there's critical mass is really starting to happen. There's a momentum, there's a belief that this is the future. And so we're past the early adopter phase now, we have hospitals buying their second, third, fourth, fifth, Mako large systems and we have competitive pressures of course that occur related to that, but the evidence and that the happy patients that are telling their stories and surgeons seeing great results, I think we still have a long way to go. It's still very early in the cycle, and we're pretty excited about the degree of interest even through a pandemic to be able to have that type of interest means, we really are getting to the point where it's starting to become accepted. It's starting to people are seeing the benefits. They wouldn't be buying their second or third or fourth, if they really didn't see clear benefits to these procedures. So that gives us a lot of excitement about the future, but I would say we're still in this very early innings. Given that there're 5,000 hospitals out there and a large number of them do orthopedic procedures. We're still at a very early, early phase. Operator : And your last question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you for squeezing me in. Kevin, I think if I recall, the neurovascular market saw slowdown last quarter, which certainly a bit concerning clinically, but taking your commentary today about neurovascular at more normalized levels. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on that dynamic, relative to your expectations and kind of as the market back to the level you expect, there's a room for that to come back further, and anything competitively that may have impacted during the quarter, just given the performance. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. No, it's not all the way back yet to the sort of the robust growth I'd had before, but it made a big step forward as the quarter as we sort of move towards the end of the quarter, and we were surprised that we really thought neurovascular is more like trauma, core trauma, that patients get a stroke or going to rush-in and they stayed away from hospitals, it was a bit of a surprise that it went down. And I don't think that was unique to us. We didn't see anything materially different from the competitive landscape, the impacts of the business were really market related, and as the market improves, we feel we're going to be in very good position, especially with the new products. So the new, large-bore catheters that we launched, just a limited launch and even the surpass of all flow-diverting stents, we weren't able to get to all the proctoring and training that you have to do, so that's been sort of a limited launch. So if anything, we have a bit of a new product tailwind. As we get out into or take the latter parts of Q3 and into Q4 but not much on the competitive front, it's really has been a market dynamic issue. Where I guess hemorrhagic stroke, some of it is quasi or let's call it semi-elective, which I would have never thought, but those are coming back, and I say I expect that the market of neurovascular will really improve going ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay, thank you. And then just really briefly for me, how much within Mako, the order book in terms of existing orders that are in process versus maybe the other side of the funnel? I think investors have had somewhat of a concern that well capital cycles are still robust. They may not reflect necessary weakness, they don't get this way but six months from now, they could be weak as there starts to be a gap in capital. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate just on that strong order book that you did call out. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I think even in capital constrained times, there's certain capital people really want and they will find the money, it means they're going to not spend money in other areas to be able to supply the technology they want, and what we're seeing with Mako is this is technology they want, and they're going to find a way to get it, and if that means using Flex Financial, great, they'll use Flex Financial, if that means curbing certain capital expenditure to funnel it into our business. That's what's going to happen, when surgeons are demanding it and there are surgeons that make a lot of money, one of the silver linings of this whole pandemic and of course, aren't many, but there are some, one of the silver linings is understanding just how profitable our procedures are to hospitals. Most hospitals know it, but when you watch your bottom line sort of evaporates, because you're not doing these high value procedures, and we play in a lot of spaces with high value procedures, neurosurgery, spine, joint replacement. They really want to be able to get that going again and doing that with great technology is very profitable for the hospital. And so, I think there's been some recognition. I've certainly heard that from certain hospitals about how important these procedures are. So our belief is we have just outstanding technology, that that improves outcomes and that the surgeons wants and if the surgeons really wanted, they're going to find a way to purchase it, and so, that may not apply to all of our capital, but it certainly applies to Mako. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with some perspectives on the recovery trends across our diverse businesses. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. I'm pleased to report that we returned to growth in Q3, posting organic sales growth of 3%. This represents a rapid improvement in our business, driven by a progressive return of elective procedures, ongoing demand for our medical capital products, and continued strong Mako performance. In the quarter, we saw uneven growth globally that correlates to the state of the pandemic. Preston will speak to this in his section. While we are pleased with the recovery of our business, the environment remains uncertain as flare ups of positive COVID cases are continuing. We had many achievements in the quarter that exemplify our commitment to innovation and providing our customers with the technologies needed to serve their patients. Beginning with Mako, we celebrated the installation of our 1,000th robotic system in the quarter. We've seen tremendous success with Mako since the launch of the total knee application in 2016 and this quarter was no different. We continue to believe that we're well positioned for sustained future success with Mako. Our spine and trauma and extremities businesses benefited from numerous recent product launches and Wright medical launched an exciting new acute care bed. Our neurovascular business also achieved some new product approvals in important market, which helped contribute to their double-digit global growth in the quarter. We maintained many of the policies put in place at the beginning of the pandemic focused on maintaining the safety of our employees and customers and aggressively managing spending. While sales and manufacturing have approached more normal levels, our spending levels were unusually low given the uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery. Our R&D spending on an adjusted basis was 6.1% of sales slightly below our expectations as a result of COVID-related execution challenges, and some timing of spending. But none of this has caused any meaningful delays to new product timelines. The combination of sales growth and suppressed spending resulted in adjusted earnings per share $2.14 cents, up 12% versus the prior year. While some of our measures will remain in place -- our spending measures, we do expect some returns to hiring and investments to support future growth in Q4. Due to the continued uncertainty and lack of stability in many markets, we are not providing Q4 guidance at this time. We saw good momentum across many of our businesses in Q3, although the recovery curve acceleration moderated meaningfully in August and September, and has been on a similar trend so far in October. We are proceeding with the integration efforts related to the Wright medical transaction and are working cooperatively with regulators to obtain the necessary approvals for this transaction. This includes as previously announced the proposed divestiture of our STAR, Total Ankle Replacement product. We expect to close the transaction in November. Please note beyond this update, we will not be taking any questions regarding Wright Medical on today's call. Finally, I would like to thank our employees for continuing to serve our customers and finding ways to succeed during such challenging times. From our sales and service personnel in the field every day, with our customers to the marketing and R&D teams that are finding creative ways to connect globally, to advance new innovations, to our manufacturing teams and office staff who ensured the continuity of our business. We are living our mission statement, which is, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. And now over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks Kevin. Today my comments will focus on providing additional thoughts on the current environment and the recovery of select devices and geographies during the third quarter. We've generally seeing a V-shaped recovery through the second quarter with the continued momentum and growth in the third quarter, although at a more moderated level of month-over-month improvement. The sales growth and improved performance in the third quarter was driven by three main factors, the continued acceleration of electric procedures, strong demand for many of our large capital products, and the return of our more event-driven businesses like trauma and stroke. Small capital products, including our video cameras and power tools show nice improvement for the lack of other products in their recovery. These products generally trail electric procedure volumes by a few months. Despite a resurgence in infection rates globally, we saw sales growth in most developed markets led by strong recovery in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Canada. These markets were operating around pre-COVID levels throughout the quarter. Our China business returns to double-digit growth in the quarter, with procedures returning to more normal levels despite the government taking a more aggressive approach to lockdowns around COVID infection. The UK, India, and parts of our Latin American businesses continue to lag as they work through heightened impacts of the pandemic. Procedural areas that were deferred or soft during the second quarter showed significant improvements in the quarter, our knee, spine, trauma and extremities and sports medicine businesses all achieved year-over-year growth. This also showed significant improvement in the quarter reaching prior year levels. Each of these businesses benefited from the acceleration of electrodes procedures during the quarter that was fueled by the addition of new patients and the recovery of the previously differed backlog. Surgeons and healthcare providers continue to work through the new and existing backlog by adding incremental procedures to their normal schedules. With the continued variability of infection rate, we believe that hospitals are better prepared to ensure that these types of elective procedures can still be performed at some level, unlike the dramatic drop that we saw in April. However, the efficient ratio remains fluid and procedural impact and recovery will continue to vary across geography. Demand for our large capital products drove strong growth in the quarter, including ongoing high demand for our Mako robotic technology. In the third quarter, we were very pleased with the acceleration of Mako installations both within the U.S. and markets outside the U.S., so we continue to expand our Mako presence. Recently, Brazil approved full use of our Mako robotic technology for both hip and knee procedures. We are also experiencing increased utilization with a growing percentage of hip and knee surgeries being performed with a Mako robot. Within our medical division we saw strengthen our emergency care business along with continued high demand for our beds and stretchers, demonstrating improved financial stability of our customers aided by government subsidies like the CARES Act, and the resurgence of the positive cash flow driven by the continuation of elective procedures. As a result, our order book remains a robust for both Mako and many of our medical practice. The launch of the new acute care bed security is a contributor to that order book and a demonstration of our ongoing commitment innovation during the pandemic. With our specialized unit, category-leading product portfolio, and innovative technologies, we are well-positioned to continue our above marketing Medtech growth. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 3.3% in the quarter. These results included growth in the U.S. of 3.5% and international growth of 2.8%. As a reminder, the quarter included the same number of selling days as Q3 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% from the prior year quarter while foreign currency had a favorable 0.4% impact on sales. During the quarter, we return to growth this demand for our procedural base products came back strongly in most key geographies and demand for large capital primarily Mako and medical beds remained strong. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.14 represents growth of 12% from the prior year quarter. The foreign currency impact on the third quarter EPS was a creative by $0.01. The strong EPS growth was mainly driven by sales dropped through, favorable sales mix, discipline cost control, and better than expected gross margin leverage as our manufacturing output returned to more normal production levels. I will now provide some brief comments on our segment sales. Orthopedics had constant currency and organic growth of 3.8%. This included us growth of 7.5%. We saw growth across knees, hips, trauma, extremities, and Mako which grew 30.2% in the quarter. Additionally, all these products are growing up strong U.S. comparables from Q3 2019. Internationally, orthopedics had an organic decline of 4.7%, which reflects the slower recovery of elective procedures in Europe as a result of COVID restrictions, partially offset by a positive Mako performance. Medsurg had constant currency growth of 2.9% and organic growth of 2.5%, which included organic growth of 1.4% in the U.S. Instruments had us organic sales growth of 1.9%, reflecting increased demand for our safety related products, including waste management and smoke evacuation products, the latter of which had double-digit growth. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 1%. This reflects a return to growth primarily driven by our sports medicine business, where we had double-digit growth. This was partially offset by moderate declines in core endoscopy and communications businesses. The medical division had U.S. organic growth of 3%, resulting from strong demand across its bed business, growing double-digits and emerging emergency care business growing high single-digits. These were partially offset by a decline in our [Indiscernible] business. Internationally, Medsurg had organic sales of 6.7%, reflecting very strong demand for medical products combined with positive performances across most of our Medsurg product categories in all major geographies. Neuro technology and spine had a constant currency growth of 5.5% in organic growth of 4.3%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted constant currency growth of 3.1%, including 1.7% of organic growth for the quarter. Overall, this reflects positive performances in our spine, CMF, and neurovascular businesses and included double-digit growth in our ischemic products. Internationally, neuro technology and spine had organic growth of 9.8% including double-digit performances in our hemorrhagic and ischemic products, and a very strong performance in our spine business. Now, I will discuss our operating metrics in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.9% was favorable 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin was favorably impacted by volume and business mix, which was partially offset by price and some unabsorbed fixed costs. Although our manufacturing output returned to more normalized levels during the quarter, there was a somewhat negative impact related to our idle manufacturing lines at the beginning of the quarter. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.1% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 31.7% of sales, which was 210 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, SG&A was favorably impacted by operating expense savings action enacted in March, which continued in the third quarter. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 28% of sales. All of the spend control measures that were enacted in March continued through Q3. These measures covered most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments and hiring travel, meetings, and outside consultants. As our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels, we do anticipate that there will be increases in hiring, discretionary expenses, and other costs that support future growth and business expansion. Related to other income and expense compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense related to additional debt outstanding. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1%. Turning to cash flow and liquidity, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of $7.2 billion, which includes $5 billion of funds related to the Wright medical acquisition. We also generated approximately $830 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which was again ahead of our internal targets. This strong operating cash flow reflects strong net earnings and a reduction in poor working capital versus the prior year. The actions that were implemented in the first quarter to conserve cash continued in Q3, which included discretionary spending controls, reductions in planned capital expenditures and project spending, focusing on opportunities and accounts payable, and slowing our M&A activities. As it relates to guidance for Q4 and the full year, we reaffirm our previously announced decision to withdraw guidance, given the continued significance of uncertainties at this time. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Kevin Lobo : Vijay, we can't hear you. Preston Wells : Vijay, are you on mute? Vijay Kumar : Okay, guys. Can you hear me? Kevin Lobo : Perfect. Preston Wells : We can now. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Well, congrats on a really strong print, Kevin. So -- and I guess, looking at these numbers here, some of the peers in quarter, you\u2019re seeing low single-digit declines. You guys are seeing a positive declines, maybe parse out, what is that the underlying market versus this constant theme of Stryker gaining share? Is that what's happening? What's driving this trend here? And perhaps also touch upon new trends you're seeing here and for any reason. Now, I saw that we didn't have a Q4 guidance, but perhaps in a sequential trends we're seeing here in Q4, is there any reason to believe as Q4 trends should be perhaps different from what we saw in 3Q? Glenn Boehnlein : So thanks, Vijay. We're pretty excited about the performance in our business. It's not a one quarter thing. I think you've seen our joint replacement division, which includes hips, knees and Mako have been performing well for some time. And that momentum is continuing. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we're pleased with October, it's going well so far in the month. But I really don't want to speculate on November, December, just given all the products that are occurring, assuming that the market stays fairly stable, we're going to have a good fourth quarter. But that's a big assumption given this is, obviously a once in a lifetime type of pandemic. So I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we were feeling good about the business through the month of October. Vijay Kumar : Got you. And then maybe one on the capital side, you guys did mentioned strong order book for Mako, large capital. I know you guys just launched a new bed, perhaps just talk about that the visibility you have on the capital side of the business and is that a confidence that you can perhaps extrapolate into next year or is this -- perhaps Q4 and then we'll see how the market shakes out for next year? Preston Wells : Hey, Vijay, it\u2019s Preston. Just to expand on that a little bit, I mean, we do continue to have confidence in our capital business. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at our large capital business and demand that we saw on Mako, and then on the medical business in particular, we feel really, really good about that. Small capital, as we talked about in the remarks as well, we expect that to continue to come along and recovery curve as well. Although, it has shown that improvement but lags a little bit, some of the other products in terms of that recovery. And I think overall we feel good about it, we feel good about where orders have come in, feel good about where our customers are in terms of their financial stability at this point in time, certainly compared to where it was a quarter ago and because of those items, we feel confident in where our capital business is headed. I think all of that is underscored, as Kevin said by the uncertainty that still remains with regards to debt flare ups and how the virus continues to kind of move through different regions. Operator : Next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And again, congrats on a much better than expected quarter. Kevin, how should we think about interpreting the comments on a go forward basis in respect to how much of a backlog is worked through, are there still patient to deferred procedures that that still need to get into queue here. And because it sounds like July was probably the best quarter, third quarter with fourth quarter current trends hold be similar, better or worse than third quarter here? Preston Wells : Hey, Robbie. It\u2019s Preston. So, I\u2019d say, in general, it's hard to predict exact percentages with regards to how much of a backlog has been worked through versus what are new patients that are coming into that funnel. Based on the feedback that we've got, we know that surgeons are continuing to work through that backlog, and that they're also adding new patients. So, it's definitely a mix of the two. We also know that there are some patients that are still waiting with anxiety to get their procedures done. But all-in-all clinics and surgeons remain busy, and they're continuing to look to add additional shifts or additional opportunities to add surgery or even a shift to the outpatient setting. Our expectation is that that trend will continue, again, barring any major disruptions from a COVID perspective. Robbie Marcus : Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Once again, you had another great Mako quarter here even in the tough times of COVID. And I was wondering if you could speak to how willing your hospital systems are to go out still and by the large capital, considering it seems like your main competitor in robotics has shifted strategy to place a lot more units rather than recognize revenue up front, it appears you're still able to recognize a healthy amount. So just wondering what the environment is like, and if you're seeing them on the competitive side? Thanks. Preston Wells : Yes, look, we continue to feel very bullish about Mako, I think in Q4, we're going to have to unless something bizarre happens in the marketplace, it'll be a record quarter in Q4, because the order book is still very strong, with over 1,000. And we've kind of hit an inflection point. And in robotics, the interest in robotics is increasing every day, teaching hospitals are adopting robotics. And they're feeling the pressure to have robotics as part of their programs. And in some cases, they've been holding off a little bit. So for us, the momentum is palpable, it's continuing, it's strong. And it's even starting to pick up in other markets such as Japan and countries in Europe, they did a little bit of a pause in that second quarter. We saw them coming back, frankly, in the third quarter. So, the outlook for Mako continues to be very bullish. And it's really irrespective of competition. This is sort of a market trend that's changing the market shifting. And we really love the offering that we have in this category. Operator : Next question we have is David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Questions. Kevin, I wonder if we could just talk maybe 2021, if we can't get the specific numbers, either relative to 2019 baseline or maybe just some top line qualitative commentary about how you're sort of seeing the top and bottom line for 2021, or specific product launches, and innovation pipeline, we should be thinking about for 2021. And then I have quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes, David, we're not going to really get into sort of guidance for 2021. We do that in every January, and right now we're planning to provide that in January. I think we've gotten good momentum across a lot of our businesses, you saw the trauma number, we posted a really strong number, they've launched a number of new products and feeling very good about that. And that's frankly before Wright Medical kicks in. So we're really excited about the momentum we're going to see across trauma and extremities next year. Neurovascular would be one that point that I'm really excited about. We have the surpass evolved next gen, flow-diverting stents stents approved in the United States and that had very good growth even though we're still having to go through the pains of posturing, but in the midst of a pandemic, so liberally from a small base, but that's going to pick up steam next year, as well our aspiration offerings with the neurovascular. So, neurovascular are very good as I look through into next year. And of course Mako will continue its positive trajectory that affects not just the Mako business, but of course hips and knees. And so those are all going well, instruments continues to be a really strong business for us and smoke evacuation you see is now becoming a standard in many areas called safety push, I think will continue beyond frankly the pandemic. And we've really established a really great stable of products related to safety. So, a lot of tailwinds. I think that will continue on a underlying basis. The big unknown is sort of how this pandemic evolved. It's still going to be with us obviously through the first half of next year in some way shape performing. And so that's not the big unknown, but a lot of the businesses that we have, we\u2019re feeling good about the momentum and the product cadence in your product, which I've already touched on some of them, we think will position as well for 2021. David Lewis : Okay. Very, very helpful. And the one business I wanted to highlight was just spine, obviously, that's been the sore point is last several quarters in years, some of your performance frankly was better than some of the emerging mid-cap spine players. Just what you're seeing in spine, have you finally the turn the corner from an integration perspective, you see more traction on sort of rep hiring, but it was a surprisingly strong quarter for you in spine just curious the underlying drivers. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, we're really pleased with the performance of the spine. I think that K2M, which was obviously tough integration. We knew would be tough, it was tough. We feel that that's largely behind us. I think we actually got a little bit of reprieve in the second quarter, honestly, to sort of get our inventory and get our position more stabilized. OUS, it\u2019s has been strong frankly from the beginning, but it getting that U.S. business on a better footing. We feel very good about that. They launched some new products, including Niagara, which is a lateral access product, a Corpectomy Cage. And so getting back to launching products, which is a big part of the K2M offense, excited that we're now back to launching new products versus sort of dealing with all of the integration challenges as it relates to sales force very stable. In fact, we're actually having sales reps wanting to come to join Stryker now in spine. So we really do feel the tide is starting to shift in spine and was definitely very good quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Hey, thanks and good afternoon. Just first question, I want to ask Kevin about your hip growth in the quarter and then just hit generally, your hip growth in the quarter was India's major below peers. So just wanted to talk about or ask you about dynamics there. But probably more importantly, also want to get your view on your pipeline in hips. And when you've got new launches coming, because I think in previous conversations, you\u2019ve talked about some exciting launches potentially in that area? Kevin Lobo : Yes, Thanks, Bob. We're actually very pleased with our hip performance. We had a good growth in hips, and we had a very tough comp from the prior year quarter where we outperformed the market in hip. So, overall, yes, competitors did well in hips. We also did well in hips. As you know, hips are a little less deferrable than knees, which really speaks to the strength we added in knees. But as it relates, the hips were very excited about two aspects of the pipeline. The first is the on Mako, we have a new software upgrade for hips that we launched in the second quarter, because of the pandemic, we haven't really been able to roll that out fully. It will get fully rolled out probably by the end of Q4. So it's a progressive rollout, but really will have more of an impact next year and in the second part of the pipeline is a new standard that we have planned sometime in the middle of next year, we'll get more specific around timing maybe in the January call. But that's going to be an exciting span, which has some features that surgeons like in a little bit of a gap in our portfolio. But overall, still pretty good quarter. Bob Hopkins : Yes, yes. Okay, thank you. And then I also want to ask you a little bit about the potential for durability of growth in the medical division. And I'm not asking about fourth quarter, I'm thinking a little bit more longer-term, because there are a lot of moving pieces in that division. Right now it sounds like Sage might be struggling a little bit, but then OUS strength has been enormous. You're launching a new bed, and then there's the corner underlying bed market, maybe just talk about your thoughts on the durability of the growth outlook for that business in light of all the moving pieces? Preston Wells : Hey, Bob, it\u2019s Preston. I think as I mentioned specifically on the capital side, we feel very confident where we're heading in terms of durability on that business, particularly as we think about things like beds and stretchers, with the launch of the new bed adding to that portfolio, very, very excited about what that's going to bring and do for us. Sage, Sage had a smaller quarter in terms of hips growth, obviously, an improvement from the second quarter, but still a little bit of a decline versus prior year. Given that business in terms of stocking and the purchase cycle, we really do expect that business can turn the corner as well as we go into the next quarter and into 2021. So I think we'll see some positive dynamics from that business. And then overall, obviously, we've seen some impact on the pandemic. And we would expect that we'll continue to see momentum on our businesses as we go forward. Specifically, as it relates to the OUS business, as you noted, we had a very strong Q3 performance really across both emergency care and our acute care business. I think it's important to note that we were really having big performances in the OUS space even before really the impact of the pandemic. And our expectation would be that even though while we're seeing some benefits, certainly from the pandemic, that we will continue to build on the momentum that I started giving before that as we go forward. So I think all-in-all, feeling very good about the future from a medical standpoint. Operator : Next question comes from-- Kevin Lobo : Yes. Just like to add one comment. The other part of the physio business is called public access. So that's outside of the emergency in the hospitals. And that business really got very, very quiet in the second quarter, it came to a halt almost. And so that'll come back, that'll probably be a little slower, maybe more in the first quarter, second quarter of next year. So, Sage will come back a little bit sooner, maybe towards the end of the year, and then public access will come back, maybe in the first or second quarter of next year. So there are parts of the business that are drags right now that will turn positive. And now of course, some pops that took off in the pandemic that will start to moderate. But we love our medical business. We love the leadership we have in that business, and it will continue to be a really good performer for us. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much for taking the question. Kevin, I just had a follow-up on this, ASC strategy have been pursuing and talking about a little bit. And I didn't want to tip your hands too much as to exactly how that all is going to work. But we'd love to get anything you are willing to share, progress so far, how it complements the another efforts to grow and maybe how it complements your relationships with some of the larger networks, which have an outpatient channel often? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes, look, I'm not going to get into too many of the details about how we're doing it. But we are very pleased with our performance in ASCs, Mako number in the third quarter and ASC's with the highest number we've had so far in ASC, so Mako is part of the solution. We had double-digit growth in our sports medicine business. And of course, that plays in the ASC primarily. And so those are the proxy that you could use to figure out sort of how we're doing in the ACSs as we look at our sports med business. Look at the growth that we're having with Mako, there's a lot of other products that we have played very well in the surgery center market. And we just basically created an align offerings that aligns our divisions. As you know, in the hospital, we tend to operate very separately, and we go in by product category, we're not doing that in the ASC and this aligned offerings is really working very well. And I want to give credit to Eddie Pearson, the entire team that sort of established this office. It's working ahead of what I was expecting, and feel very bullish about it going forward. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s terrific. And then just follow-up, you mentioned strengthen growth in China, despite some of the pandemic controls you are putting back into effect there. And you've mentioned last call on the call before just about the move into China was Mako going forward and understanding that I'm guessing that a lot of that early activity is in the sort of premium self-pay market. And maybe any update or progress as to how that's going and any early results that you've seen in terms of feedback or uptake? Kevin Lobo : Sure, thanks, Matt. So let me start with Mako. So we only have the hip approved right now in China, we don't have yet have a total knee, we hope to get that in the first or second quarter of next year. It's taking longer than we had expected. But we're on track so we won't get it eventually approved. But we are getting sales with Mako for hip. But of course once you get the knee on the robot, and of course the sales will start to really accelerate. There's just been a general pickup in general. So the pandemic they've done a good job controlling the pandemic in the country. We've seen a pickup both in our Carson business, which is our lower priced products, as well as in the premium segment. So it's kind of I would say an across the board pickup that's occurring and really related to the Coronavirus. I think we had a great year last year in China, our best year on record in a good year, the year before we have strong management team both on the trusting side and in the premium segment. As you know, that's been a more recent thing for Stryker. So I would expect that we'll continue to see that kind of performance since the market conditions improved markedly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. To Kevin on the operating margin. In Q3, it obviously stood out the 260 basis points or so improvement year-over-year. And I heard the comments that, some of it was spending that you deferred because of the pandemic. But my question is, how much of this may be durable because of things you've learned, to do more efficiently during the pandemic, and how does it make you feel about, the 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on an annual basis that you you've targeted? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hi, Larry, this is Glenn. You're right during Q2 and Q3, we obviously continued a lot of the cost containment measures that we had enacted in March. And these were kind of things that other companies probably have looked at travel, meetings, training, consulting. And just the real whole gamut of discretionary spending was really kind of locked down. We also slowed our hiring. We slowed project spending on sort of non R&D type projects. And I would say, coming out of this, you're absolutely right, we've learned sort of new ways to work. We're doing this call virtually, and it seems to be working fine. We also have launched virtual training with customers, and also internally that has worked very well. And so I would say, some of that very definitely will carry over to the future in terms of how we sort of emerged from the pandemic and what our operating structure looks like. That being said though, as we get back to more normalized operations, and back to a growth trend that we expect to be at, there will be increases to all those expenses. And some of them will return to pre-COVID levels just because that's what we'll need to support sort of the growth assertions that we'll have. Key projects will start back up. We'll see hiring pick back up. So all of that will start to grow with -- as we emerge from this. So, if you think about the 30 to 50 basis points, I do think that probably a more normalized basis to look at would be looking at 2019 in terms of an off margin that that we might assert relative growth off of. But we have not backed away at all from our financial assertions, we will grow at the high-end of Medtech. And we will continue to expand our off margin 30 to 50 basis points. Larry Biegelsen : That's super helpful, Glenn. And one follow-up question. Just I think for Kevin, on M&A, with the exception of the right deal, you've been relatively quiet on the M&A front. Any thoughts? And is it due to valuations, just any thoughts on kind of your appetite and pipeline for M&A? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. We intentionally slowed down M&A in the second quarter, just because we were not sure what was going to happen with the pandemic. We asked the teams to sort of put their pencils down, stay active in discussions. But we really wanted to be sure that -- we didn't know that recovery would happen quite this quickly. So we're pleased with that. We do have our M&A teams back up and running. Because of the right medical and the debt that we're taking on because of that, we don't expect to be doing very large deals in the next year or so. But we look for more tuck-in deals. And we do want to stay busy with M&A. And we've said that to the rating agencies. Our teams are actively looking at targets but they sort of never really stopped. It did just slowed down a little bit, while we saw sort of a pace of recovery. But you should expect us to get back to our normal kind of tuck-in offense, which will complement the right medical acquisition. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. This is Patrick on for Matt. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I want to start with Mako. You've done a really nice job with placing Mako and the underlying demand is really strong. But I'm curious if you could give us more color on the sales cycle. Specifically, I'm wondering if there's a chance that the sales cycle kind of over the longer term remains elongated as some of these hospitals work through financial pressures. So any color you have there would be really helpful? And then I have a quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Just to answer that, no, we don't expect that the sales cycles elongate. Matter of fact, it's one of the things that we've seen over the last couple of quarters is we've actually been able to get out and drive Mako even faster. And so there's still quite a bit of runway as you think about opportunities for Mako. So don't expect that that cycle to elongate. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's really helpful color. And briefly, I know this might be kind of a long -- longer way out higher level. But I'm just curious if there's any changes to the way you guys are thinking about the robotic offering in spine, either through a Mako platform or the Mobius asset. I'm just kind of curious about how you're thinking about that pipeline as the spine business really picks up momentum and starts heading in the right direction? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. We're really not ready yet to publicly talk about what the robotic offering is. It will be important for our sponsors. It's no question. Mobius did come with a robotic pipeline product. Once we're ready, we'll share. We're actively working on an offering we're just not quite ready to share what that will be and what the timeline is. But stay tuned. Operator : Next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Appreciate taking the questions. Congrats in the quarter. Kevin, you call about Sage performance being maybe a little weaker than expected, was that a reflection of procedural volume? Or is there anything from a protocol perspective in terms of preoperative sterilization that may have changed for some customers given the pandemic? Kevin Lobo : Yes, look, I will tell you, first of all, we weren't surprised by the STAR there wasn't weaker than expected, it was certainly negative sales growth. In fact, it was -- everything we had was a little better than expected in terms of the pace of recovery. The nature of the sales cycle per Sage, you need to have a lot of activity in the hospital where you have procedures being done, where the products are being used, because they're consumed, as you have people in the ICU, that people that are getting procedures done. And so the census in the hospital was lower in the second quarter for sure. And certainly even in third quarter. And these products are bought in bulk, and they're put on the shelf, because they're consumed daily. So you have this sales cycle that it sort of has to be depleted, the inventories have to be depleted before they're reordered. So that's not at all a surprise the fact that the sales were negative, it just sort of explains why that was a drag in the U.S. on our medical business, we don't have a very big stage business outside the U.S., it's more of a U.S. phenomenon. But we love the products. In fact, we launched a new product, a self-oral care product, which is really exciting in the midst of the pandemic, which is getting great customer feedback. But of course, that's just going to take time for that to be ordered. And then they put on the shelf. So once the ordering, once the usage starts to happen, and the inventory start to bleed down, we're going to get sort of this bolus of reordering. And again, that may not occur fully in the fourth quarter, but towards the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. We'll expect that Sage to get back to its normal very strong growth. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, one on Mako, not so much on the unit volumes, although it's certainly encouraging. But I think there was a software upgrade cycle earlier in the year, I could be wrong on that. I certainly call that the hip software upgrades. But how should we think about, the upgrade cycle for software of Mako in the install base, and what that can do for growth, maybe over the next 12 to 24 months within the existing customer base? Kevin Lobo : Yes, look, software upgrades are important. They just help with the ease of use and billing productivity for the surgeon. We did a software upgrade on hips in the second quarter. We are working on one for knees as well. The hip one had some very important -- but it wasn't just a software upgraded that had easy to use to do with registration, which is one of the frustration points perhaps, but it also provides new information to the surgeon on pelvic tilt, which they're finding really beneficial. So I do expect it will cause -- it was already increasing the use of nickel for hips, but that'll probably accelerate into next year. But that software upgrade is still being deployed in the field and then we'll share more about the new software upgrade when that happens as well. So we're -- this is not new, we constantly look to provide better usability and usage factors to our surgeons. And that's a common thing. But I wouldn't call that inflection point. It's just a continued good customer experience, which we'd like to have with all our products. The real boon is just the adoption of Mako, the success surgeons are having, the hospitals purchasing their second and third and fourth Mako\u2019s, the growth in teaching hospital, the growth in surgery centers. So there's just -- it's just kind of the inflection point that we're seeing that I think will continue to last for many quarters ahead. Operator : Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening, and very nice quarter. Two questions. The first one is Mako related. There's a lot on this call. So I'll turn line in. Can you give us an idea of what percentage of hospitals currently have a robot? And where do you think it ultimately goes to? And instead of a cheaper question, because when we do our survey work, I talked to hospital administrators and physicians that have one, two, three, they seem to not be able to get enough robots or enough type of robots. I'd love your sort of view on the landscape. And then really, the second question has to do with seasonality. Is there anything happening in the big broad world outside of the pandemic that you think will impact the fourth quarter? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Thanks, Joanne. So look, the first question it's really just about when you're in a new market adoption, it's not easy to predict, right? How far will it go? Should robotics become standard of care, as we've seen happen in some other procedure areas? Maybe. And if it becomes standard of care, you can do the math of how many hospitals will do robotic procedures and surgery centers that are being added that do robotic procedures, there's a -- there's a huge number of robots still to be sold. And so that's -- that's the underlying question is, will it become the standard of care, that's expected in all procedures, and we're obviously striving for that. And the industry is moving in this direction, the pace of the curve is really hard to predict. But your points, right, and what we're seeing is, we always like to have certain champions with every robot that we sell. So we don't do mass sales of robots, we don't do C-suite sales of robots without certain champions, that's just not the way we operate. And so what happens is, the robots that we do sell, get used to right away. And when they're used, the surgeon shares their experience in the surgeon rounds with the other orthopedic surgeons, and then they want to watch this procedure, they get interested, and then they'd like to use it. And then what happens is, the robots fully booked, and that that surgeon gets frustrated, and then goes to the administrator and says, I'd like a robot for my procedures. That's a dynamic that we've seen happen over and over again. And that will continue. So at this point, how many hospitals there are that do the procedures? It's a large number. And we think that there's a long, long runway. We're still in the early stages of robotic adoption, in orthopedic procedures. Sorry, I lost the quote. The second question again, Joanne, do you mind repeating? Joanne Wuensch : Of course, second question that is in on seasonality, I can't we have a pandemic Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, seasonality -- sorry. On the seasonality question, Q4 is normally our strongest seasonally quarter that we have. And so November, December, it's really hard to predict this year will we see the same type of seasonal impacts? The surgeons are saying they still want to be busy hospitals and realize the importance of elective procedures to their own profitability. And so will we see the normal push? I don't know, I know, the surgeons we talked to seem to think that they're going to be busy. But it's a question I can't answer because we really, we've never been through this with a pandemic. But right now, we're not seeing any signs of something changing. It seems like there's a normal dynamic outside of a pandemic. So as long as surgeons can go to operate, they're going to operate and they've become very creative in terms of figuring out how to do their cleaning protocols. They're actually very efficient. Some hospitals are opening longer hours, or even opening up on a Friday or on the weekends to stay busy. So we'll have to watch it closely. But I really don't have any new insights to provide, I don't expect something different from what we've seen in the past. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed. Josh Jennings : Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the strong recovery. Wanted to ask future medical indication question, I you're not giving timelines. But just thinking about the development of the shoulder indication should be thinking about the development they\u2019re being exclusive for right medical extremity portfolio? And those just the push out of that acquisition do anything to the timeline of make shoulder indication? Kevin Lobo : We're not really going to get into the timeline. We believe that the robotic -- robotics shoulder is going to be compelling. Shoulder is a very difficult procedure to do as sort of more akin to partial knee than it is to total knee or total hips. And we believe it's going to be very, very compelling. We're excited about the progress that our team has made on the application and we're not going to talk yet about what implants are going to be married with the robot. But we will be sharing that at a later date. Josh Jennings : Okay. Understood. And then follow-up of STAR ankle divestiture, just thinking about the Stryker extremities portfolio, are there any other divestitures that need to occur before the close of the deal? And then just wondering, if you could help us with that as we think about forecasting out in 2021 and making sure we account for any other divestitures outside of STAR? Thanks a lot for taking the questions, guys. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, problem. So as we talked about, we're not going to get into too much more in terms of medical offering. Kevin mentioned the divestiture of STAR. We believe that we're on path with regulatory agencies to close the deal in November. And so we'll leave it at that. Operator : Next question comes from Kaila Krum with Truist. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Sam on for Kaila. Thanks for taking my question. First one, I just wanted to ask about the Arrow System, Mobius -- curious how you described about a year end and now how that's performing? And then generally, how the -- capital market for imaging versus say the strength in robotics is performing? And then any impact you're seeing on call through to other businesses from that system? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, we were thrilled with the Mobius acquisition, we bought a terrific technology. Our biggest challenge honestly, has been scaling up the manufacturing. So we've had very, very high demand for Mobius. It was a small company based in Shirley, Massachusetts where just large challenges really scale up and it\u2019s the same challenge we've had, frankly, the TSO3, which is the sterilizing company that we bought, and a lot of times when we buy smaller companies, the demand tends to overwhelm us. And we have to go back to the design robustness and be able to scale the manufacturing, build new production lines. And so that's a high class problem, I would call it, we really, really pleased with the aero product, it performs extremely well. It frankly, had an increase in demand. In some cases, they were using it to look to do imaging for COVID. And so we've been frankly struggling to keep pace, but it's -- like I said, a high class probably -- we are really excited about, they also have good products in their pipeline as well. So it's a deal that -- that will be very much help correspondences for the long term. But we're still in the scale update. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then just with resuming more spend on rep hiring into the fourth quarter, if you've maybe, maybe tease that out a little bit, we actually think about that in terms of more returned to normal rep hiring? Or are you thinking about maybe pressing your strength a little bit and getting a little more aggressive? While some competitors may be struggling? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. It's a good question, Sam. You know, I think I think it's the divisions look out towards 2021. And they're planning sort of their -- their budgets and where they can get to, it always will include new rep hiring. And so an absolutely our regular cycle is that we would get started on that in Q4. So I think that, most divisions are planning to expand their rep sales forces towards the end of Q4, and certainly on into January of next year. And that would be just part of the sort of the general territory management that we go to every single year. Operator : Next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for taking the question. The first one I had, I want to follow-up on your comments on your bed launch and the bed market. And it had kind of a two part question. Really trying to understand, if you're seeing a trend towards bed market expanding and that could create more opportunity for you? And then was just hoping that you could comment on, how this new rollout to go you expect it to go into your own dates and do mostly conversion of your older beds? Or do you think there's a share game opportunity? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. So in terms of the bed market itself, I think there's probably a bit of both right. So there's, there's obviously going to be the replacing cycle of beds, it's going to continue to happen. But I think the pandemic is also created some opportunity for expansion in the market as well. So I think there's going to be a mix of both of those items as we go forward. With regards to productivity, and what that's going to do for us, again, we feel really strongly about that bed and the opportunity. And there will be some opportunity, like I said, both in terms of replacing a cycle that'll fit into and then expanding into competitive opportunities as well. Matt Taylor : And can I just ask the follow-up those really interested in your comments about standard of care robotics of Mako, and I think we've seen the knee value proposition is very strong. And I was wondering, if you also think that you can convert that to be the standard of care for hips over time and other areas that your vision that will be standard in many areas or more siloed? Kevin Lobo : Yes. No, the vision is for it to be standard care everywhere where we have an application now. I think it will take longer, you've seen the adoption of hips has trailed the knees, the adoption in partial knee which very, very strong. I think the adoption a shoulder will be very, very strong. Knees will continue. And I think it's eventually just it's just going to take a little longer because frankly, the satisfaction level of patients with hips has been quite good relative to knee, so relative to shoulder. And I think over time, total ankles, there's many other areas that robotics will play in. And that's our expectation is that it will become standard of care. Just a question of how long will that take? And what iterations are required for us to get there. Operator : Next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Jamie on for Rich. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess. The first one I wanted ask you guys been pulled out some strength and smoke evacuation product line? I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that that grew double digits in the quarter? And then just kind of, digging into that a little bit what's really driving the strength in that product category? Is it something that you're really starting to see pickup now kind of just in the wake of COVID? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. On the smoke evacuation, yes, I did reference that we had double digit growth in that product line. And honestly, even before COVID, most hospitals and caregivers have been very focused on safety and smoke evacuate lines up extremely well with that safety focus. I think with COVID, it's a sort of even more emphasized in terms of what that product does to the environment that they operate in, and how it contributes to the overall safety sort of platform and focus that we're seeing across all hospitals. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just as my follow-up. Talking about double digit growth in the neurovascular business, just curious and to get your thoughts on how sustainable you think that is with some of the new product launches you have had into 2021? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, we're accustomed to seeing our neurovascular burdens through double digit growth. This is something they've been doing for -- since we acquired the business almost once the target launches got rolled out and phoenix segments started to grow. And now that we have proposed a voting stance in the U.S. market, the China markets continuing to grow very strongly. So we expect continued double digit growth for some time with the tailwind in phoenix. And now, you're really addressing quarterly stance and aspiration. We really got a -- we had a terrific management team for a long time. They continue to be humming, and we expect that business to continue to perform extremely well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steve Beuchaw : Hi. Thanks. I wonder if you could spend a bit more time on the ASC and outpatient environment. I think once upon a time, there were questions around the category that were probably rooted in some concern about pricing. But in this environment, it's clearly a tailwind. I know there was a question already about market share. But can you speak a little bit about the procedure growth trends and ASC and outpatients relative to hospitals? How much you think that's a sustainable trend beyond COVID? And how do you think about that commercially in as much as it could be a structural advantages of multi-line player versus a more concentrated line specific player? And then I do have a follow-up? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, first, let's start by keeping in mind that a small number of our procedures, let's call it around 10%, of our large joint spine procedures are being done in the ASC. So it's not a big part of our business yet. But the trend is no doubt headed for more of these procedures being done in the ASC, part of that changing Medicare around needs. And we expect that to happen in hips. And so it's a trend that was already happening pre pandemic, it's a trend that will accelerate going forward. There's all kinds of prognostications about how much it'll be, could it be 50% of our procedures, it's hard to predict, how fast it'll move. But we believe we're really, really well positioned for this trend. And we do intend to be a multi-line player, that's what the ASC actually wants. It's unlike how the hospital but they have a different buying pattern in the surgery center. And the breadth of our portfolio is a huge advantage. And we plan to really leverage that strength wherever we can. So, we're feeling very good about it. It's a trend that in terms of pricing, we're not seeing really any change so far in the pricing dynamics, there is a constraint around capital ASCs are much more capital sensitive. So, we do tend to have more financing involved in surgery centers, but the overall equipped to do that without Flex Financial, we've been doing financing for a long, long time. So we're feeling very good about our position to be able to win in the ASC. And we do think it's going to be more important, and the trend will accelerate. Steve Beuchaw : Okay. That was actually a fantastic answer. You answered my next question. So I'll leave it there. Thank you so much. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q4 results with you in January. And that's concludes the call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Preston, with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before opening the call to Q&A. I would like to start my comments by expressing my appreciation for the perseverance shown by our employees, as they work through the many challenges that we faced during 2020. Throughout the year, we maintained high employee engagement, while continuing to support surgeons and caregivers around the world. Our fourth quarter organic sales declined roughly 1%, reflecting the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, offset by continuation of emergent procedures and strong performance by our large capital products. We are also excited about closing the Wright Medical deal during the quarter and the category leadership that we gain in the fastest-growing segment within the orthopedics market. Preston will provide some additional updates on the integration shortly. Throughout the quarter, we maintained the financial discipline instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, which, combined with a favorable tax rate, led to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.81 in the quarter, up approximately 13% versus 2019. And we delivered impressive cash flow from operations, which exceeded $3 billion for the full-year. In addition to closing the Wright Medical acquisition, we also made progress in many areas that will provide future growth opportunities. We have established a structure focused on digital, robotics and enabling technology, where we see significant opportunity to create a company-wide unified digital ecosystem, including Mako. We maintained our commitment to drive innovation across our various business units, including Neurovascular, where we gained new product approvals across aspiration, stent retrievers and flow diverting stents. And in our MedSurg segment, where we continued product introductions with a focus on safety and prevention. Finally, we successfully launched our ASC sales model, which leverages the Stryker portfolio to provide end-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand and shifts to the outpatient setting. Our continued support for our customers and our commitment to innovation will position us well for growth as the pandemic eventually subsides. Turning to 2021, our people and culture of execution remain strong, which will allow us to deliver on our commitment to make healthcare better and to resume our customary strong organic sales growth and leverage earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will provide an update on the current environment, trends related to the latest COVID-19 impacts and updates on our most recent acquisitions of Wright Medical and OrthoSensor. During the fourth quarter, elective procedures were negatively pressured in most regions globally as localized infection and hospitalization rates surged through the month of December. As a result, growth was uneven and correlated to the state of the pandemic in each region. The areas impacted the most include the U.S. and many of the countries in Western Europe, most notably, the United Kingdom, driven by a countrywide lockdown. Even with the procedural variability, we saw growth in emerging markets, including China, which grew double digits over prior year quarter. Looking forward, hospitals are better equipped to handle this resurgence and they are working to bring back the procedures that have been delayed, though we expect that the variability of elective procedures will continue through the first quarter until infection rates begin to decline and the distribution of the vaccines become more prevalent. This slowdown in elective procedures had a negative impact on our more deferrable businesses, which make up approximately 40% to 50% of our total sales. However, the slowdown this quarter was not as impactful as the decline in the second quarter as hospitals were better equipped to manage COVID patients, while maintaining some level of elective surgeries. Despite the overall slowdown, we experienced continued growth in our Neurovascular, Medical, Mako and upper extremities businesses. Specifically, demand for Medical's large capital products continued in the fourth quarter, driven by the focus on expanding bed capacity, the need for our emergency care products like power costs and the LUCAS device and the availability of some remaining CARES Act funding in the U.S. In addition, the early trends on the launch of our new ProCuity are positive and expected to continue into 2021. During the year, our Mako installed base grew by 33% and exceeded another milestone, with over 100 robots sold and installed in the fourth quarter. This growth continues to highlight the demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology, as well as our ongoing success at selling and installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts. We are also excited about our recent approvals for Mako TKA in China, Russia and Brazil, which all provide opportunities for growth as these markets continue to embrace robotic, digital and enabling technologies. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, approximately 44% of our total knees will make the knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase. The shift towards cementless needs also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless needs made up 42% of our U.S. knee procedures. During the pandemic, feedback from surgeons has pointed to limited trialing of competitive products and businesses like joint replacement, as surgeons worked to perform procedures restricted by cancellations and deferrals. However, as the pandemic subsides and we return to a more normal environment, we expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by our Mako installations throughout the year and our strong order book heading into 2021. We are also enthusiastic about the Wright Medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through Wright's diverse portfolio of implants, biologics and enabling technologies. The combination of Stryker and Wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers' ability to address patient needs across the more than $3 billion extremities market. The integration has been progressing well over the last few months. The long period from signed to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place, leveraging our years of deal experience. To date, the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization. Considerable progress has been made, including the creation of specialized business units and sales forces for Trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle, which is a key part of our overall decentralized strategy that allows us to remain close to the customer. The U.S. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned. Outside the U.S., the leadership team is working to align the sales forces throughout the year. Our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day-to-day business. And during the quarter, there was minimal disruption caused by the closing and integration activities. Finally, I want to restate our ongoing commitment to M&A, which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of OrthoSensor, a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement. Smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopedics and the addition of OrthoSensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technologies, including intraoperative sensors, wearables and ultimately, smart implants. As it relates to 2021 guidance, Glenn will provide an update on our full-year guidance for sales, operating margin and EPS. Updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter if necessary throughout the year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales decline was 1.1% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2019. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.8% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Early in the quarter, there was continued momentum from Q3. However, during November, the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the related cancellations of procedures, primarily in the U.S. and Europe significantly impacted our sales momentum. However, we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we had strong results in our Mako, medical beds and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales declined 1.5%, reflecting the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, Medical products and Neurovascular products. International organic sales were flat, impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic primarily in Europe, which was mostly offset by growth in Canada, China and Brazil. Organic sales decline for the year was 4.8%, with a U.S. decline of 5.8% and an international decline of 2.1%. 2020 had one additional selling day compared to 2019 and for the year, price had an unfavorable 0.7% impact on sales. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.81 increased 12.9% from the prior year, reflecting strong financial discipline, good operating expense control and a favorable operational tax rate. Our fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by $0.03 from foreign currency. Our full-year EPS was $7.43, which is a decline of 10%, reflecting the impact of lower sales, especially in Q2, as well as the impact of idling certain manufacturing facilities during the year, offset by strong expense discipline throughout the year. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 2.8% and an organic sales decline of 5.8%, including an organic decline of 5.7% in the U.S. This reflects a slowdown in elective procedures related to COVID-19 and a very strong prior year comparable as Q4 2019 U.S. organic growth was 7.2%. Other ortho grew 12.3% in the U.S., primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. The Trauma & Extremities business also delivered positive growth led by our core trauma and shoulder products. Internationally, Orthopaedics declined 6% organically, which also reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown, especially in Europe. This was somewhat offset by stronger performances in Australia and Canada. During the quarter, the Wright Medical acquisition was successfully closed. For the quarter, Wright delivered flat growth on a comparable basis. This included positive performances in U.S. shoulder, double-digit growth in U.S. ankle, as well as strong international growth led by Australia. On a comparable basis for the full year, Wright had a 10.3% decline, mainly driven by the COVID-19 related slowdown in the second quarter. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency growth of 1.5% and organic growth of 1.3%, which included 2.2% growth in the U.S. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.5%. In the quarter, sales growth was driven by gains in its power tool, waste management and smoke evacuation products and its service business. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 7%, primarily impacted by the slowdown in the capital businesses, offset by gains in the sports medicine business, which grew over 9% in the quarter. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 9.7%, reflecting solid performances in patient care, emergency care and at Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had an organic sales decline of 2.4%, reflecting a general slowdown in instruments and endoscopy businesses and strong comparables across most geographies. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 2.1%. This growth reflects many strong performances within our Neurotech product line, including neuro-powered drill, SONOPET and Neurovascular, offset by the impact of procedural deferrals, especially in the U.S. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted an organic decline of 1.2%, as procedural deferrals impacted sales in the quarter. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.5%. This performance was driven by strong demand in Australia, Japan and China. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.1% was unfavorable, approximately 120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, gross margin dilution was impacted by price, business mix and unabsorbed fixed cost as production was brought in line with reduced demand during the quarter. This was primarily offset by acquisitions and foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.3% of sales, which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 200 basis points. This reflects the continued focus on disciplined operating expense controls, which have been in place since the second quarter. These cover most of our discretionary spending, including curtailments in hiring, travel, meetings and consultants. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales, which is a 90 basis points improvement over the prior year quarter and reflects the impact of the spending discipline previously discussed. Related to other - related to other income and expense as compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding related to the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 8%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 12.6%. These rates reflect one-time operational fluctuations that arose due to the pandemic, with a mix of foreign losses related to lower foreign manufacturing activity, combined with reduced U.S. sourced income that resulted from the sharp drop in sales at the end of the year. For 2021, we do not anticipate these circumstances arising, as we expect to return to normalized operations during the year and we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $14 billion. During the quarter, we executed the Wright Medical acquisition, which resulted in the disbursement of $5.6 billion, inclusive of the retirement of Wright's convertible debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This historically strong performance resulted from the disciplined working capital management, somewhat offset by lower earnings. Turning to cash flow for 2021. We will not be repurchasing any shares and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be approximately $650 million. Anticipating a more normalized year in 2021 and a ramping of investment in our businesses, we expect the free cash flow conversion rate as a percent of adjusted net earnings, including the one - excluding the one-time impacts from the Wright Medical integration of 70% to 80%. And now, I will provide 2021 guidance on a standalone legacy basis and further guidance including Wright Medical. We are providing our guidance in comparison to 2019, as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. As Preston indicated, we will be providing annual guidance on an organic sales growth and earnings and will update this throughout the year as part of our regular earnings calls. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% for the full year 2021 when compared to 2019. As a reference, our organic sales growth excludes Wright Medical. There are the same number of selling days in 2021 compared to 2019 and one less when comparing to 2020. Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. Additionally, as we are comparing growth to 2019, our 2021 organic sales growth guidance includes two years of price reductions. The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly favorably impacted as compared to 2020 and 2019. For the full year 2021, we did not expect to deliver operating margin expansion as a result of the op margin dilution of the Wright Medical acquisition. However, excluding the dilutive impact from Wright, we do anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2021 for our legacy Stryker business compared to 2019. This includes anticipated increases in hiring, discretionary expenses and other costs that support future growth and business expansion as our businesses continue to ramp back to more normalized levels. Finally, for 2021, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20 for the full year. This includes the previously announced $0.10 dilution, driven by the addition of the Wright Medical business for the full year. While Wright Medical is dilutive in 2021, we expect it to be accretive starting in 2022. As it relates to other aspects of Wright Medical, we expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the low to mid single digits in 2021 when compared to 2019. This includes the integration of Stry's legacy extremity business with Wright Medical, which will all be part of our trauma and extremities Division. This growth is impacted by the recovery from COVID-19, partially offset by the synergies from the integration activities in 2021. We also reiterate our previous guidance on cost saving synergies from the deal of approximately $100 million to $125 million over the next three years. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on the Q here. \u2013And I guess maybe a high-level start off on the guidance question here. Eight to nine organic for the base business, what are we assuming for Wright Medical here for growth for our fiscal 2021? Hello? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hi, Vijay. Sorry I was on mute. Our organic guidance is 8% to 10% and the guidance that we provided related to Wright Medical, you have to understand that it's being integrated into our Trauma Extremities businesses. So we will be combining in our legacy extremities business with Wright Medical and running that combined group as part of our Trauma Extremities division. So when you mix all that together and you really look at what will trauma and extremities growth be in 2021 as compared to 2019, we do think it will be low to bit single digits, but keep in mind that also takes into account sales to synergies for Wright Medical that we fully expect will happen in 2021. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Glenn, maybe if I could, just one quick one on margins off the cash. I mean Q4 was really impressive. The margin on the OpEx side, if I look at the guidance here, perhaps it seems a little conservative, and I look at the EPS guidance range, it's coming in a little bit lighter versus the typical Stryker in the guidance range, if you will. What would cause \u2013 I mean, that's almost a 100 basis point swing within the low-end and the high-end, perhaps talk about what goes in at the low-end and the high-end? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, it's - Vijay, I would tell you that based on what happened this year and the variability that we saw in our operations, we fully expect to continue to experience some variability on into Q2. And so our guidance range really reflects how that ramp comes back. On the low-end, it could be all the way through Q2. On the better end, we start to see much more improvement towards the beginning in Q2. And really - it really is going to be variable depending on that. I mean, we have passed our legacy Stryker business on the op margin front with 30 to 50 basis points improvement. But keep in mind if you look at Q4 or if you can even go back and look at Q3, it really reflected pretty draconian expense control in terms of hiring, travel, meetings, consultants, you name it, discretionary expenses and we put the lid on that. So that's not sustainable, especially if you think about our aspirations to grow at the high end of med device, so we will start seeing that spending pick up as we continue to supplement and hire our sales forces, as we meet with customers, as we add to our prototypes and loaner pools, all those things will start to add to our expenses. So that's really what's underlying the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed. Bob Hopkins : Thanks and good afternoon. So just two quick things. Glenn, just to clarify that guidance on the revenue side, I appreciate that you're guiding to organic growth, but sounds like Wright Medical was flat in the quarter, which is actually pretty impressive. So, I come out a little bit over $17 billion for the year, just based on kind of your guidance of 8% to 10% organic, and then I'm just tacking on $900 million to $1 billion for Wright Medical, and getting to a little over $17 billion. So I was wondering, if you thought that was in the ballpark. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Bob, again, I just can't reiterate the variability that we're seeing and so maybe that's sort of adding up the obvious set of numbers, if you will. I think we took the range 8% to 10% because we do feel like there is going to be some variability that we can't exactly forecast at this point in time and where we're sitting in Q1 and what we're seeing. As far as Wright Medical goes, we were pretty pleased with where their Q4 performance came out, but they are also subject to a lot of the same variability, which is why, we're looking that once we integrate it with trauma and extremities, we will have some sales, the synergies that just naturally occur. We felt that with K2 and Spine and we will fill that with Wright Medical. So taking into account that variability, you're really looking at 8% to 10% for the - for Stryker legacy and low to mid single digits as we look at the combined Wright and Trauma & Extremities. Bob Hopkins : Okay, fair enough. And then, Kevin, just quickly for you, just curious to get your kind of macro perspective on what you're seeing out there as far as the current state of the business right now, hospitals willingness to buy capital, kind of where we are in terms of procedure growth, just would love an updates given the environment so volatile on what you're seeing right now. I think that would be helpful? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Bob, I would say, certainly at the end of the year, really did, we got that second wave spiking and certainly you saw that in the discretionary procedures, a pretty big slowdown after a pretty good month of October, and it really start to tail off November-December. On the large capital front, we're actually very excited. So what we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4 from an order book standpoint is continuing to be very strong. So that is really good news, it's good news for Mako, it's good news for Medical. On the small capital side, we've always said that that tends to lag a little bit, that the recovery in discretionary procedures and you certainly saw that within certainly the endoscopy division and the instruments division, where I would say that those orders are maybe going to take a little longer to really come back in the same way. But overall, I mean, we have enough confidence now with the hospitals being ready to do these procedures as soon as the pandemic starts to subside, as soon as the vaccines start to become more prevalent. But, they will turn it on pretty quickly and they'll be pretty agile, and that's why we feel pretty confident of being able to give a - I think a healthy guide certainly going back-half off of 2019 around 8% to 10% organic, so we - so it will spike throughout the year starting with a - obviously a slower Q1. And the good news is we have the whole year. So even if the discretionary procedures drag a little bit, we saw in Q3 a pretty big spike once things started getting healthy. So over the course of the year, we're hoping that and believe that the guidance will be - we will be able to sustain even if it's maybe a little softer in Q2 and little stronger maybe in Q3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. David Lewis : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones from me. Kevin, I was sort of comparing the revenue guide, the earnings guidance. The earnings guidance is kind of interesting to me and that it's basically 12% earnings growth, what you guys are doing kind of last couple of years minus Wright Medical. But the revenue growth is a little higher, right? The 8% to 10% over 2019 is a little better than the earnings growth guidance. So it's above your structural growth rate, but I think some would argue probably should be just given a lot of the recovery. So how should we interpret that 8% to 10% number, Kevin, relative to the structural growth rate? And what are some of the key factors underpinning that? Or how do you think about the structural growth rate of Stryker here as we come out of October 2019? And I have a quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Sure, David. I mean without getting into every single division, what I would just give you as a macro comment is we feel that we have the right offense to continue to win in the market and continue the strong growth. You saw for seven straight years, we accelerated our organic growth. In 2019, we culminated with over 8% organic growth and I think that muscle that we developed, the structure that we have in our business units, the new product pipeline that we have, has positioned us to be an above-market grower and we expect, fully expect that, that will continue into 2021. There are obviously differences by divisions, but we feel like we're in a very healthy position overall. And that's what gives us confidence in the guide. Clearly, Wright Medical is a big acquisition. There are dis-synergies that we've assumed there. It was highly dilutive to the normal operation of our business. We'll see how that unfolds over the course of the year. The early signs of the integration are very positive, but we have put in some improvements there just based on what we've experienced with our K2M acquisition and what, frankly, all other implant companies have experienced with their integration. David Lewis : And then just lastly just on Ortho competitiveness. Kevin, I know the environment is very, very invisible. All we have is sort of one competitor results to go after here. Any reason to believe that your momentum has changed at all? I mean your robotic system placements are very strong and you kind of went from 30% knees and cementless, robotic to 40% pretty, pretty darn quickly during COVID. But any reason to believe that your relative positioning or relative share momentum versus other peers in '21 is going to look a lot different? Kevin Lobo : Yes. No, we remain very bullish about our joint replacement business as well as Mako. And you saw just the increase in Mako is pretty remarkable. To have almost one out of two knees being done on Mako and it's not been that many years since we launched the system. So unlike navigation in the past, which obviously never had this type of an uptick, we continue to have strong, not only installations of robots, but utilization. And even hips, we're seeing that continue to increase as well and the new hip software was installed in about 400 accounts in Q4. So, we had the approval, obviously, earlier in the year but because of the pandemic, it's taken us time to actually be able to go and do the upgrades. But that will pick up steam again into 2021. So again, looking at one quarter, whether it's a positive or negative in a pandemic world, it's not something I am too concerned about it. It's just based on where your regional strength is. If you happen to be in a state or a locality that's doing procedures, then you got benefit and if you didn't do, that hurts. So it's a little bit random during the pandemic, but structurally, I think we're in great shape with that business. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Shagun Singh : Thank you so much. This is Shagun in for Larry. Yes, I wanted to touch on the acquisition of OrthoSensor. Kevin, the acquisition really marks your entry into the sensor technology, remote patient monitoring and smart implant space in a much more meaningful way. And I was wondering if you could comment on the timing here. Why now, given that you've had a relationship with them for several years with soft tissue balancing? And then how are you thinking about timelines for integration and launch with Mako? And then also the launch of smart implants, any timing you could share? And also if I could squeeze in one more. How are you thinking about the application of sensor technology beyond knees into shoulders and hips? Anything on timing would be great. Thank you. Preston Wells : Yes. Shagun, this is Preston. Just in terms of the timing of the deal itself, I mean, again, we are constantly looking at different opportunities and it was just the right time with the team to make this acquisition in terms of what we thought we were able to do with it. So, I think just the timing of it just happened to work out the way that it did. And we typically do look at our targets for a long period of time. In terms of other timelines about when we're going to be bringing some of the different things to market, at this point, we're not ready to disclose those timelines. Just know that the teams are getting to work, to develop pretty robust time - excuse me, robust pipeline around that sensor technology. And as we have more information, we'll certainly be bringing that to you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed Robert Marcus : Kevin, I was hoping you could comment on, as you're thinking about later this year and into next year, there were lot of patients that didn't end up getting procedures in 2020 and probably the first half of 2021. How should we think about the potential for a bolus of patients? I realized there is limitations to what the system can do, but there is still lot of patients that need to be treated. So how are you thinking about that as an organization? Preston Wells : Robbie, it's Preston. I'll take that one. In terms of that patient backlog, certainly, we saw some of that being worked down in the third quarter as we saw the recovery starting to happen. And certainly then, we saw more deferrals happening in the fourth quarter. You saw more people being added back to that backlog. As Kevin and Glenn both articulated, as we see the recovery happening in 2021, we would expect to see some of that recovery include the backlog of patients that have been deferring now anywhere from three months to six months or so. And so we would expect to see some of that flowing back into the numbers through 2021. I think the one caveat I would give you is we won't necessarily see a dramatic spike in those numbers, just given certain aspects around capacity and things like that. So, you will still see surgeons and hospitals working to fit additional surgeries in and same things that we saw in the third quarter. But you certainly won't see a significant dramatic spike at any one point in time as a result of backlog. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe just one more question on Neurovascular. I remember in 2019, back in the old days before COVID, you were hoping to at least accelerate that business in 2020. You had some new product launches. I was hoping you could just give us the update on where you're going to have new product launches in 2021 and how you're thinking about that business? Thanks. Preston Wells : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. First of all, Neurovascular had a really terrific year. They had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. They were obviously just like everybody else affected in the second quarter and into the third quarter, but double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, extremely exciting portfolio of products, new product introductions. Obviously with Aspiration, we have the Vecta 74 catheter out. We have the pump. They're doing very well. Then we have this flow diverting stent, the second-generation flow diverting stent approved in the United States, the Surpass Evolve. We have the first-generation flow diverting stent approved in China, our Atlas stent, which is used in hemorrhagic segment. Our adjunctive stent is doing extremely well in China. So, we really have a great portfolio. And we have the NXT, the next generation stent retriever as well recently launched. So, a lot of new launches. This management team is truly outstanding. They've been in place since, frankly, we acquired the business. They have a very healthy pipeline of other products coming as well. So, I'm very, very bullish on the Neurovascular business. We ended the year with great momentum, and I expect we'll continue to be a very strong performer in the years to come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. And may proceed. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you taking my questions. One quick guidance question for you. And I - understanding, you are not providing quarterly guidance at this time, but normally, you get about 23% of annual EPS in the first quarter. And because you are still seeing pressures in deferrable procedures in January. Is there any chance that some part that you can give us some cadence on the first quarter earnings versus your normal run rate? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Pito, I would just tell you - and this is - we're not in a normal run rate period, right? I mean, I think we're still coming out of some pretty variable trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and continuing certainly into the first quarter. A lot of it's going to depend on the localized hospitalization infection rates and really how those decline over time and how the vaccine is out there and more prevalent. So, I think that's what I will continue to look at, as we think about what that recovery - that recovery trend is going to be. At this point, it would be too hard really to give you too much guide on how that's going to exactly happen. And that's why you see the wider guidance that we provided. Pito Chickering : And also, for follow-up, as more procedures are moving into the ASCs due to COVID to free up our space and capacity in the systems, have you seen hospitals change their purchasing habits to buy either cheaper - begin plans or push back on pricing or to adapt to the lower reimbursements in the ASCs. Kevin Lobo : Yes not at this time, we have not seen any significant changes in that - in those habits at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. You may proceed. Matt Hendrickson : This is Matt Hendrickson in for Joanne. First question we have is just around Mako and robotic knee systems, you guys had a great quarter, great momentum in the New Year. But J&J is coming out with their Velys robot. They received FDA approval, and also, Zimmer is kind of in full swing their launch. So just kind of putting the two together. Is there any change in your commercial plans as you've now have more technology out in the market? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, this is Kevin. I'll take that. First thing, I would tell you is the introduction of competitive systems has not slowed down our Mako momentum whatsoever and we don't expect that to change with one more system on the market. If anything, it's just proves to further validate that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics. And we really believe, we have the best solution on the market as evidenced by the uptick in the procedures and we disclosed the fourth quarter, almost two knees in the United States being used with Mako. So surgeons absolutely love our system and are using it at very, very high rates. There also is a synergy with the way that our system ensures an absolutely perfect cut. And with HaptX, which we're the only ones to have but that is very complementary with cementless and you see both of those adoption rates moving in the same direction. So we love our chances of competing side by side with anybody and we think this provides a further tailwind in the adoption of robotics in orthopedics. Matt Hendrickson : Good color, thanks for that. And then for follow up, just going to the Wright Medical acquisition. Before they were acquired, they had always talked about their enabling technology, their preoperative planning software being kind of their main driver to capture share and to expand the market. Has that strategy changed at all? Now that you are beginning to integrate with them, are you going to continue kind of with that strategy of focusing with enabling technology first and. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, what I would tell you is that certainly, we've always been believers of enabling technologies as evidenced by some of the different businesses that we've acquired with some of the different products that we've launched, and really with a focus on improving patient outcomes. And we believe that a lot of the technologies, including the blueprint technology that Wright had previously invested in are complementary really to some of the platforms that we have. And as part of the integration with the right organization, the R&D portfolio and technology teams, they are all working together really to build out what those long-term pipeline plans are going to be and really leveraging all of the different unique products and capabilities from both sides. So, we will continue to see investments in those areas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with Truist. You may proceed. Kaila Krum : Thanks for taking our questions. So, I appreciate the guidance that you gave for 2021. Can you just speak to how you think each segment of the business will grow relative to the total organic range you provided? And I guess, I'm most curious just looking at MedSurg and Orthopedics. I know you are assuming some of medical, the demand slows down in the coming quarters and that backlog picks up in ortho. And just any more detail on that would be super helpful. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Kaila, we don't typically provide any of that segment breakdown in terms of our guide, but I think if you just take a look at - that looks we are expecting to happen in the marketplace and what's really been happening through 2020 and as we go in - into 2021, certainly those businesses that we have that are affected are more affected by elective procedures should see the benefit of elective procedures returning throughout the year. The other thing I would just say, as Kevin had mentioned to our smaller capital products are really those products that are facilitating many of those elective procedures should also see some of that benefit. And then as it pertains to really the large capital segment, we've continued to see strong demand in those areas and would expect to continue to see some of that demand throughout '21 as well. Kaila Krum : And then just a follow-up I guess to Peter's question earlier, is it fair to say that I mean, Q1 will be sort of the softest of the year, Q2 will have the higher growth kind of off an easier comp and the second part of this year should feel a little bit more normal? Kevin Lobo : I think, it's certainly fair to say that the variability that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect that to continue into the first quarter and then we should see benefits happening as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Steven Lichtman : So first, I was wondering if you could provide some additional color around the ASC sales model that you're rolling out. Any details you could provide on what the model looks like and any early feedback from the field would be great? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, I'm not going to get into too much detail just for competitive reasons, but I would say that I'm delighted with the ASC offense that we put in place. It involves people from different parts of Stryker that basically quarter backed the deal and bring in multiple divisions based on the unique needs of every ASC. Every ASC is unique. Every deal is a customized deal but the way we've navigated this enables incredible collaboration across our divisions. We've put just absolutely fantastic people in charge and really we have the breadth of our portfolio with capital equipment, disposables and implants and really for the first time as a company, we're really leveraging that in the United States. We have had success with such model sometimes in other countries around the world. But in the U.S., this ASC model has been truly fantastic, exceeded my expectations. And I'm bullish that they'll be able to continue to have great success in the ASCs and frankly, Mako is often part of that formula in the ASC, but not always. We obviously had a presence in performance sports, but that business, fortunately, has really started to grow as you even heard in the fourth quarter in spite of the pandemic, it grew over 9% and so having a strong sports business plus all of our other businesses and now with the Wright having extremities, category-leading position, we just have a fantastic portfolio to serve the needs of the ASC, and now a commercial offense again not getting too specific, but let's just say, we make it easy for the ASC and we provide customized solutions. Steven Lichtman : Thanks, Kevin. And then just a follow-up on the fourth quarter, how did your spine franchise specifically hold up during the recent spike in COVID cases and any thoughts on that? This is overall looking into 2021. Thanks. Preston Wells : Yes, I would say that the spine business held up a little bit better. We saw spine procedures in general holding up a little better than some of the other elective procedures, particularly for our spine business outside the United States performed well. And I think it's just a function of the successful integration that we've had with the K2M business and combining that with some of the enabling technologies like those that we acquired through Mobius. And again, we saw some continued performance in some of the markets outside the U.S. that had more stability in spine related procedures like Japan and Canada as well. So I think, all-in-all, it held up a little bit better. We definitely expect that business to continue to perform well, as we go into 2021 and really harnessing the power across K2M, our legacy spine business as well as the enabling technology. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS. You may proceed. Matt Taylor : Thank you for taking the question. So I thought the disclosures on Mako were really interesting and bullish and just had two follow-ups on that. One is where do you think you can push Mako penetration and cementless penetration in the U.S. over time, and would love to hear your thoughts O U.S. both on that question and just on the opportunity, again, you just had all these approvals in new geographies? Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. So certainly, I'm delighted with the progress, both with the Mako adoption as well as Mettler's. I don't think Mettlers will ever get to where it is with hips, just because of bone stability. It's a weight bearing joint, but clearly, we can now see, it's going to be significantly higher than 50%, which I think five years ago nobody would have believed if we had said that. So that's pretty remarkable. In terms of the actual use of Mako, as you saw, we have a lot of robots installed this year. So I would expect that that looking at the percentage of having these done with Mako will continue to increase, same with hips. Outside the United States, it's going to - it's taking a little longer obviously because of the approvals, but we're really excited about getting the total knee approved in China, Brazil and Russia and certainly Japan and China are going to be very, very good markets for us. Japan, we've made some progress already. Maybe the approvals took a little longer there as well. But the new hip software, of course, is also very important. As you know, there's a lot more hip procedures done in that part of the world. It's almost not the same as knees unlike the United States. So, we love the fact that we have multiple applications, all approved in those markets and we would expect you're going to see a similar kind of growth that you saw in the United States. They may not be quite as quick. You've seen that, frankly, with Intuitive in soft tissue robotics. The uptake is a little slower outside the United States, but we expect the same kind of runway longer term and are very bullish about the prospects, especially in China, Japan, Brazil, for sure, are going to be terrific markets for Mako. Matt Taylor : Maybe just a quick follow-up on that. With Wright in the house now, could you give us updated thoughts on some timing on the robotic solution for shoulders and for spine? Kevin Lobo : We're not really ready to give timeline yet. We have to get a lot closer to launch before we're going to be specific about timelines. I would say that I'm extremely bullish about shoulder. I think I've said that in the past. It's a very difficult procedure to do. That our enabling technologies have been right, that were - our teams are working on with our Mako teams. And we'd be very excited to be able to bring that to the market with their market-leading implants. But I'm not yet ready for timelines and same with spine. Not yet ready for timelines. We have two options for spine. One is the robotic program that was being developed by Mobius prior to the acquisition as well as Mako. So, we have work done in both areas. But I'm just not ready to give timelines. Robotics is complicated. And we will keep you posted. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for taking the questions. Just first for me. Kevin, around the capital equipment demand, I was just wondering if you can talk about kind of the dynamics in play in 2021. You've been very strong with that and you haven't talked much about maybe booms and lights. And so, is this a story of kind of the first half, second half and how to think about that composition of capital equipment moving from the first half to the second half and what that may entail in terms of your portfolio? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, booms and lights certainly hasn't been as positive as Mako and the beds and stretchers. And certainly, the defibrillators because the medical capital really did - had to ride a bit of a pandemic tailwind, if you will. And booms and lights large construction sort of slowed down a little bit. That should pick up starting next year. And that's part of the drag that you see within the Endoscopy division with the booms and lights portion. But certainly in ASCs, they're busy, but certainly the large capital spend projects were delayed a little bit. They are starting to pick back up again. So, that's obviously a smaller business within the overall Stryker. But Medical, we continue to feel bullish. So, we did get a bit of a pandemic benefit, but this new bed that we launched is really a fantastic product, getting great customer feedback. Sage has also picked up. So, that was really hit hard in the second quarter, third quarter, had a nice pickup in Q4 and that business will presume its high growth as the pandemic subsides. So the diversity of our portfolio is really that gives us the optimism that we're going to continue to see strong growth in Medical. And it wasn't just sort of a pandemic bump and then will suddenly drop because of the innovation in our portfolio and frankly, just really, really strong commercial execution. Ryan Zimmerman : And then just a follow-up from me. Another business that doesn't get a lot of attention is sustainability. And I'm just wondering if there's been any change in practice due to COVID and demand for that business and kind of that - the whole reprocessing market itself with hospitals. And how to think about that over time as we potentially normalize and the strength of what that can or can't do? And again, I'm appreciating that it's small. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. No, I would just say that it's - those products are used in discretionary elective procedures. So, they were directly hit in the same way that you saw our other deferrable procedures being hit. And so because of the nature of those products, as the pandemic subsides that growth will pick up. So, there's nothing more to read into than that. Our hospital behaviors didn't really change either positively or negatively. If you can do the procedures, they will use the products. If those procedures were sort of shut down, then those products weren't being used and then they weren't being purchased. So, I would expect it to follow a similar pattern just based on other elective procedures Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Andrew Stafford : This is Drew on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to start off briefly on Wright. Maybe you guys could help us by comparing and contrasting the Wright integration process to the one you went through with K2. What stage of the process have you already completed so far, considering the longer deal closed timeline? And then, I guess really what I'm trying to get at is, about a year into the K2 process, you're ran into a couple of additional challenges. Do you feel you have a good start with that for Wright, and what gives you confidence and the contribution you baked into guidance? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So certainly, as I think about those two acquisitions, there are some similarities and then there are some pretty big differences. The similarities maybe in the foot and ankle side, where there is more of a true integration that's happening between the Stryker business and the Wright business. But for the upper extremity side, it's much more of just bringing them into Stryker and continuing on with the growth that they've had. So it is a little bit different from that perspective, as we think about bringing on the acquisition of Wright versus K2. Just like with any and all of our previous acquisitions and we've learned along the way and leave those learnings as we plan for additional or new acquisitions that are coming, the same was true with Wright. And so we utilized really that year long period between sign and close to ensure that we're focused on getting the correct integration plans in place so that we can hit the ground running. And today, that's what the team has done. They have executed to the plan. And as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've really done a lot of focus on ensuring that the sales organization are being integrated in a timely fashion. And so that's where we are at this point and certainly, we will continue to provide some updates as we continue with the integration throughout the year. Andrew Stafford : And then, I appreciate the commentary on Mako and ASCs. It sounds like your placement mix continued to shift a little bit today, ASC here in Q4. So, I guess the question is, as we look out a year and of course, COVID environment, do you see the interest from ASCs tapering down any? Or do you think it continues ramping over the long term? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think the trend of the ASC is, it was already accelerating prior to the pandemic. It's going to continue without a doubt, especially for hip and knee procedures, foot and ankle procedures, even some of the spine procedures. So, I think this is a permanent trend. It will continue. And obviously, now we have reimbursement coverage for hips as well as knees through Medicare. So, this is a trend for the future. And I actually think it's not going to stop in the United States. There is already countries like the UK and even Canada are looking at moving to lower cost sites of care. It's a good thing for health care overall. And these surgery centers make good money. They're very profitable. They don't have the burden of the cost of a large inpatient hospital. So, you can debate with the actual pace of the curve, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is a - it's a trend that's going to continue to accelerate. Kevin Lobo : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. You may proceed. Richard Newitter : A couple of quick ones on OrthoSensor and then a follow-up. On OrthoSensor, can you just remind us what you plan on doing with the intraoperative, the Verasense capability? I know that some of your competitors currently use that, use that system. Are you going to continue to sell that as an open architecture? And then - and then second on OrthoSensor is just - excuse me, should we think of when you do offer your first iteration of a product there, whether it's a wearable, external or whatever it looks like, is that going to be something that you'll charge separately for? Or do you think you will package it in with the procedure? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. So on OrthoSensor, obviously, it's new under the belt here a few weeks. And so it's not something that we have fully developed all the various plans in terms of how we are going to market for any of the product at this point in time. And so as that happens, we'll certainly be able to come back and give you updates with regards to how we're going to market and what the impacts might be in terms of what the legacy business was and what we expect it to be in the future. And I think the same holds true as we think about the future product launches, as well as I mentioned before, we haven't defined all those timelines yet. And so all of the items that you bring up in terms of how it will commercialize, how it will be sold, et cetera, will all be developed and done at that point. Richard Newitter : And if I could just one more on the M&A front. Congrats on getting Wright Medical finally over the finish line there. I guess, should we think of you as very much out in the market, size of deals, everything fair game and back to kind of normal Stryker M&A, not just small tuck-ins, or maybe anything you would if you care to comment on or share with respect to your view of the M&A outlook? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Sure. I think obviously we took on additional debt when we did the Wright Medical acquisition. We've also made commitments to reduce our debt over the next few years and so that will be something that's ongoing. And you'll see that in our financial performance. But because M&A is so important to our growth strategy and keep in mind that our normal M&A strategy is really just smaller tuck-in deals. It's what we do well, it's what we do best, and we can execute those quickly. So I think just like with OrthoSensor, you will see us continuing with smaller tuck-in acquisitions like we normally do through the year, and I don't anticipate that you'll see a - sort of a big acquisition of the size of Wright Medical for a couple of years. And frankly, if you think back to even when we did Sage, and when we did Physio, those were two very large acquisitions. We moved into a strategy for a year or two, just doing tuck-ins, which served us very well. And so I think, it will play out very similar to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed. Mike Matson : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I wanted to ask about the ProCuity bed launch, maybe you can give us an update on where things stand with that. And I was wondering, if you could give us an overview of the kind of smart bed capabilities that you're planning to that platform? Kevin Lobo : Sure. So that is out in the market in a limited way in the fourth quarter, and really rolling out for a full launch as we think about the first quarter of 2021. In terms of the features and benefits, really it's a - three things I would probably point out to here, I think one, just advanced fall prevention really focusing on keeping patient safe, as well as we think about low height feature. I think the bed drops down to about 11 inches off the floor. And then also, it's - the first bed that's really truly wireless. And so really all of those items trying to meet some unmet needs in the marketplace to drive benefits in the bed market. Mike Matson : And then, I know you're not giving specific guidance for the margins for 2021, but just given there's several moving parts, specifically with gross margin, you've got rate, which I think is coming in at a higher gross margin, but then you had some fixed cost absorption issues in 2020 that could spill into 2021. Can you give us any kind of insight into where you expect the gross margin to end up and kind of the sequence of that throughout the year? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Actually, I think you did a pretty good job of summarizing it. Wright will definitely come in and be accretive to our gross margin, as those products generally have a higher gross margin than sort of the average of our other business. I also think to - as you look at business mix that will normalize as the year goes forward and so we will also see kind of those higher margin orthopaedics products becoming a bigger share of the total. And I think, we will largely come back to sort of what our view is sort of normalized margins, as you look at 2019. Conversely though. Just as a reminder, moving down to op margin, you are going to see that discretionary spending pick up as we support growth. And so that will likely go the other way, and will be on a ramp largely as sales ramp throughout the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. You may proceed. Eric Anderson : This is Eric over Josh. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the 4Q performance and hips for a minute, this is a procedure category that we had been thinking, perhaps, would be a little more resilient to any pandemic headwinds in the quarter. I was just wondering, if you could share your thoughts on that business, particularly in the U.S., excuse me. And just help us understand what's behind that result. Thank you. Preston Wells : Yes. So I think Kevin outlined it pretty well before. I think overall, just looking at one quarter in the midst of a pandemic is tough to do because of the variability and really the localized impacts that we were seeing from a elective procedure standpoint. So certainly, you would expect that that hips, might be a little less deferrable than knees just given the nature of the disease and the degeneration. But at the same time, elective procedures depending on where you are in the world were being stopped and so hips were not immune to that, like some of our other elective procedures. As we look forward, certainly with the rollout of all of the installations to Mako that we've done this year, as well as our new hip software, we're really expecting continued above market growth from our hips and knees as we move forward. Eric Anderson : Understood. Thank you. And then quickly, I was wondering if you're able to share what percent of the Wright business is levered to outpatient procedures? Preston Wells : No, that's not something that we're sharing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. You may proceed. Jeff Johnson : Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess just one last one, just it sounds like China and Latin America held in better in the fourth quarter, have you seen any change in that trend line over the last few weeks or as we've gone into 1Q here just are those continuing to hold in better than some of the European and U.S. markets or anything we should be thinking about even in those markets early in the year? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I would tell you, we haven't seen any significant trend shifts heading - making that transition from fourth quarter into first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just had two questions. One, Kevin, you mentioned sports being a pocket of strength. Just wondering if you could flesh that out for us. Really, what's driving that as the new products that we should be focused on. And then secondarily, you talked a lot about building a connected ecosystem of implants enabling technologies. I think we understand the opportunity with Mako pretty well. You clearly got OrthoSensor, that's going to flow in. But maybe just help us understand what that means for the company longer term, does it bring you close to your customers and prevent share loss or competitive loss. Are there new revenue streams that come in? Just from a big picture perspective, how should we be thinking about that over the next several years? Kevin Lobo : Okay. Sure. So I'll start with the second part, this, the world is obviously going more and more digital. We have a Stryker health cloud. There's all types of data that we're collecting from Mako that we want to be able to mine that data with thousands and thousands of procedures already being done. And really connect that with sensors. So we really see this as not just limited to joint replacement. It's going to be across all of our businesses whether it's trauma, whether it's cranial maxillofacial, sports. And so this is something we're really excited about and we named Robert Cohen, the head of that business on behalf of all of Stryker. And so we already had initiatives going on in different parts of the company, and we are sort of bringing it all together to really create more leverage and really be able to have centers of excellence around different types of technology blocks. And so to us, it's extremely exciting. Robert knows the company very, very well. It's - I think many of you know, Robert, very well positioned to lead this function for the company. And sorry, can you go - repeat the first question, again. I'm sorry with that. I didn't catch them. Kyle Rose : Yes, just about the strength that you saw in the sports medicine - around them maybe just-- Kevin Lobo : Sports, yes, so sport has been just a fabulous story for Stryker. But when I joined the company almost 10 years ago, our sports medicine implant business was really tiny. Most people didn't even know we had a sports medicine implant business, and we have grown it pretty dramatically since then, primarily through internal innovation. But we've also done a series of very small acquisitions, and one of them was Pivot, you may recall for hip arthroscopy. More recently, we launched a lateral row anchor for shoulder which has been, we call it Omega product name, which is a fantastic product. We picked up, throughout the year, we picked up another product as well which - these are all key fundamental products, whether it's in knee, whether it's in hip or whether it's in shoulder. So we - now we have all three of the joints very well covered in sports, and we are just growing at again very, very robust rate. And the timing couldn't be better with the shift to the surgery center and being able to use sports combined with our other divisions. Again, we really ported on in the last few years in sports, because of lot of investment internally that we've done. And we have a fabulous year. That business is run out of Denver and we're really excited about the progress we've made in sports. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much for taking the questions. I think just one on shoulder and what I think one on, just a follow up on some of your comments on market share trend. So wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the overlap of rates surgeon customers in shoulder with sort of your traditional end markets, and you know what, if any opportunity there is there for sort of cross selling or going through relationships that sort of thing. And then as I mentioned, just one quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So clearly, Wright Medical had a much bigger shoulder business than Stryker. And a lot of the Stryker business frankly where with the hip and knee surgeons, but also did some volume of shoulder. And the teams are obviously working on that through the sales deployment, working out which surgeons are going to be allocated to which sales people. They made great progress on that front. And cross-selling opportunities will exist. But as Preston mentioned before, this integration is not going to be as tricky as the integration on foot and ankle, just given that we tended to - they tended to be strong with a, I'll call it, fully dedicated upper extremity surgeons. And we tended to be stronger with those surgeons that did a smaller number just as a general statement. So, I think this integration is going to be terrific. We were really thrilled that we'll have the leader from Wright Medical take over the combined business of upper extremities. And their Head of Sales is also running the combined sales organization and they're both outstanding leaders. And we are delighted not only to bring the business and the products of Wright Medical, but being able to bring over some of their key leadership. Even the leader of our combined foot and ankle business came from Wright Medical. So not only are we bringing over great technologies, we're also bringing over great talent with that acquisition. Matt Miksic : And then just a follow-up on sort of market trends. I think you mentioned here just in Q&A that you expect to continue to grow above the market in joints or Orthopaedics or knees, if I heard correctly. I'm just wondering for clarity, looking back on Q4, understanding lot going on and regional differences, et cetera, but is your expectation that your numbers there also represent sort of above end market procedure growth? Or is it just - or is it just too hard to talk about that, given the variability? Kevin Lobo : Matt, I would just tell you, at this point, it's very difficult to really talk about just given the variability and it's not dissimilar to what we've seen really in second and third quarter as well in terms of how the surgeries are being deferred and where they are being deferred and how they're coming back. So, I think that really is difficult to use one quarter and certainly difficult in the midst of this pandemic to use one quarter. So I think, as we look at it, we're looking at, as we get to those normalized rates and knowing what we've done from a Mako, implement a Mako placement and install standpoint, that we have a lot of runway to go in terms of growing markets in knees. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So, thank you all for joining our call. Like you, I'm very, very pleased to have 2020 behind us. And looking forward to a strong year in 2021. We have to get through, obviously, the remainder of this pandemic. But as you saw from our guide, we are feeling very confident about the future. And we look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you in April. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are also discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Despite the ongoing presence of the pandemic, we posted a strong quarter of organic sales growth of 4.7% versus Q1 2019. This was driven by outstanding international results, particularly in Asia Pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model. Across our franchises, Mako, neurotech and medical had excellent performances, each posting strong double-digit growth versus 2019, a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year in these businesses. Mako followed up a very strong Q4 with a banner Q1 performance, including an uptake in international installations. As expected elective procedures were negatively impacted to start the year, which had the largest impact on our hip and knee businesses. However, the trends improved progressively throughout the quarter with the U.S. hip and knee accelerating in March and into April where we are seeing mid single-digit growth as compared to April, 2019. We also saw improved growth in small capital within parts of neurotech and instruments during the quarter. In addition, our order book has picked up across our capital businesses, which is a good sign of pending growth as procedure volumes return to more normal levels. These trends give us confidence in achieving our guidance of 8% to 10% full year organic sales growth compared to 2019, which is equivalent to 12% to 14% organic growth versus 2020 despite one less selling day. While the press release shows our performance versus both 2020 and 2019, we believe that 2019 is a better reference point for comparison. Our momentum has continued regarding cost management and cash flow, and while spending will increase to support future growth, it will be done in a disciplined manner. Glenn will elaborate on our raised EPS guidance shortly. We also published our first annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy as well as commitments regarding our carbon footprint, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain transparency. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in these areas. Overall, I am pleased with a strong start to the year and the momentum that is continuing to build. And while pandemic flashpoints are still occurring, we are well positioned to deliver growth at the high end of med tech with leveraged adjusted earnings. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. Our comments today will focus on the first quarter performance in our combined trauma and extremities business, an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical and on our most recent acquisition activity. During the quarter, our combined trauma and extremities business showed good resiliency growing 2.6% including Wright Medical compared to 2019, despite the ongoing impacts of COVID restrictions during the quarter. Our trauma business, which is less elective in nature, benefited from inclement weather in the U.S. and Europe in February. Performance in upper extremities and foot and ankle was driven by the recovery of elective procedures throughout the quarter, along with lower than expected sales dis-synergies through the initial stages of the integration. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business in the first quarter, we now expect the combined business to deliver a mid single-digit growth for the full year when compared to 2019. We remain encouraged with the progress and pace that the team has delivered with bringing the businesses together throughout the Wright Medical integration. As we have mentioned previously, we utilized the lengthy period from announced to close, to build and resource the robust integration plan that we are now executing. As we move through the quarter, our teams made progress against many key integration milestones. To date the team has established three distinct business units with specialized commercial, R&D and selling organizations. We believe this dedication and focus will be a core driver of future growth across trauma, upper extremities, and foot and ankle. In addition to establishing dedicated business units, the team made considerable progress with our U.S. sales integration, including the establishment of sales leadership, sales channel and territory alignment and identification of cross-selling priorities. Considerable progress has also been made on aligning the long-term portfolio and pipeline strategies. Our focus on the integration will remain a key priority for the remainder of 2021 as we balanced the complexity of the integration while minimizing sales disruption. Over the next few quarters, we will conclude the U.S. commercial integration, including the initiation of cross-selling. And we will kick off sales integrations across our international markets over the next several months. Finally, our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of TMJ Concepts, a medical device company that manufactures a patient-specific temporomandibular joint reconstruction prosthesis system. And our craniomaxillofacial business, personalized medicine plays a critical role in the acquisition of TMJ Concepts supports their business strategy and driving category leadership through innovation and purpose of restoring form, function and hope to patients. These acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market leading growth. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the [Technical Difficulty]. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 4.7% in the quarter. As a reminder, this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q1 2019, and one less day than 2020. Compared to 2019 pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4% versus Q1 2020 pricing was 0.9% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellation, primarily in the U.S. and Europe negatively impacted our sales. However, towards the end of the quarter, we did see improvements in sales momentum, primarily in the U.S. and our Asia-Pacific businesses. Also as noted in the fourth quarter, demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our Mako and emergency care products. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 1%, reflecting the continuing slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the pandemic, somewhat offset by strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 15% impacted by positive sales momentum in China, Japan, Australia and Canada. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.93 increased 2.7% from 2019 reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition, as well as an overall disciplined ramp-up in operating costs. Our first quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.03. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics at constant currency sales growth of 17.2% and organic sales decline of 0.7%, including an organic decline of 1.7% in the U.S. this reflects a slowdown in elected procedures related to COVID-19. Other ortho grew 49% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. As noted previously, in March we began to see good sales momentum in our U.S. orthopedic businesses with all segments delivering positive organic growth as compared to till March 2019. Internationally orthopedics grew 1.5% organically, which reflects the COVID-19 related procedural slowdown and Gibson knees, especially in Europe offset by strong performances in Australia and Japan. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical, delivered 2.6% growth on a comparable basis. This includes strong performances in U.S. shoulder and U.S. trauma. In the U.S. comparable growth was 4.4%. In the quarter MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 5.3%, which included 1.6% growth in the U.S. Instruments at U.S. organic sales declined of 3% primarily impacted by continued procedural slowdown that impacted its power tool business partially offset by gains in its waste management, smoke evacuation products and services business. As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2019 instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 18%. Endoscopy had a U.S. organic sales decline of 5.7%, reflecting a slowdown in some of the capital businesses, which was partially offset by gains in our general surgery, video and sports medicine businesses. The latter of which grew over 11% in the quarter. The medical division at U.S. organic sales growth at 13.6% reflecting double-digit performance and its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally MedSurg had an organic sales growth of 19.9% reflecting strong growth across Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan and medical endoscopy and instruments. Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in our interventional spine, neurosurgical and ENT businesses and 27% growth in our neurovascular business. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 12% reflecting strong product growth in our neuro power drill, Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, bioresorbable and nasal implants. Additionally, within our U.S. neurovascular business, we had significant growth in all product categories including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 31.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights for the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.4% was unfavorable approximately 40 basis points from our first quarter 2019. Compared to the first quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by price, acquisitions and business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was unfavorable to the first quarter of 2019 by 70 basis points. In summary, for the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 23.5% of sale, which is 160 basis points decline over the first quarter of 2019. This reflects the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition combined with a disciplined ramp-up in cost to fuel future growth, as well as the two year compounding of certain costs given the comparison to 2019. We also reiterate our operating margin expansion guidance of 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement over 2019 operating margin, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the first quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to increases in our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13%, given our mix of income. Given our current circumstances and the outlook for the full year, we would expect to be at the lower end of our range for the full year guidance effective tax rate of 15.5% to 16.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $715 million of maturing debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $450 million. This performance reflects the results of earnings continued good management of working capital and approximately $170 million of one-time expenditures related to the Wright Medical integration. Based on our first quarter performance and the current operating environment, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. We believe that the recovery ramp of elective procedures will continue to be variable based on region and geography, and will continue into the second quarter of 2021. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be in the mid-single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year, and this has included in our revised guidance range. Based on our first quarter performance and including consideration of our improved full year Wright Medical sales impact, discipline's cost management and continued positive recovery outlook. We now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Robbie Marcus : Great. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. So maybe first start on the outlook, Kevin, you mentioned in the release in the script that March was much better than the rest of the quarter overall with most items in ortho growing in just rowing in March. I was hoping you might give some early color or good way to had a frame second quarter here. Coming out of the fourth quarter call the street had a wide range, it didn't really update through the quarters trends developed. So I was hoping maybe you could start off with giving some thoughts on where second quarter might shake out given the trends you're seeing here exiting first quarter? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Hi, Robbie, first thing I would say is, if we're not going to be providing quarterly guidance, but I can give you an indication of what's happening. We did indicate in my prepared remarks that U.S. knees is currently growing in the mid-single digits, and that obviously was the business areas that were most impacted by the pandemic. So that recovery is pretty notable. If you look back in January and February, where we were declining and we at the end \u2013 by the end of March, we started to pull ahead into positive territory and you can see that that's on the upswing. Difficult to predict with the flash points around the pandemic, but you can see we feel very good about confirming the full year organic sales growth. So whether that occurs in April, May, June, July parsing it by month is obviously very difficult. The other thing that makes us very confident on the full year outlook is the order book for capital equipment, both large capital and small capital, which is both picking up. So overall we're feeling bullish, obviously growth has to accelerate to get to 8% to 10% organic when you start at 4.7% in the first quarter, but the exact pasting between Q2, Q3 and Q4 so little uncertain. Robbie Marcus : Great. That's really helpful. And maybe Glenn, it seems like a lot of the $0.10 dilution for Wright might've came in first quarter and earlier in the year. One is that true and second, any thoughts on just as we straighten our models out here, I realize you're not giving guidance but just had to think about the progression of EPS as we incorporate, Wright Medical here and some of the comments on expense management you've made earlier in the call? Appreciate it. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Robbie, if you just \u2013 if you just think about the activities that are going on related to the integration of Wright Medical, naturally we would be working on cost synergies early in the year and incurring a lot of the costs that we need to incur relative to integrating Wright Medical, as well as aligning our sales forces and all the things that Preston mentioned. A lot of that did flow through in Q1, and I think that impact was certainly reflected in our EPS. I think moving forward as we think about it, we are optimistic about where we stand relative to sales, the synergies and how that'll play out for the remainder of the year. And so a lot \u2013 some of that positivity is certainly reflected in our EPS guidance and we fully expect that that benefit will also contribute to sort of raising the guidance like we did. And then as it relates to the cost management and how that'll play out in a year, we are encouraging divisions to ramp up some of their sending's to make sure that we are properly positioned for growth that would also include spending in innovation. And so we are making sure that we are not doing anything to hold back product development and other innovation spending that frankly will be needed to really fuel growth even towards the end of this year or even next year. So I think we'll see growth in that spending. And then, we did learn a lot from the experience that we went through and how we work. And so there are some benefits and savings that we fully expect to realize in the full year, as it relates to primarily SG&A costs. And so it's kind of a balance of those things that really get us to a lot of the confidence we had in raising our guide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. One, Glenn, back on the guidance questions here. Is the assumption to your back half perhaps we're looking to double-digit organic growth versus 2019? Is that a reasonable assumption, just given how we're seeing procedures come back, maybe your commentary on mid-single growth in April, it seems like back half will be double-digit, is that a reasonable assumption? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I think, Vijay, you could probably do the math as easily as I can, in terms of what it will take in the back half of the year to really get to the 8% to 10%. But yes, we do see accelerating growth and we'll see accelerating growth throughout Q2, in fact, underlying some of these assumptions is that Q2 has sort of a return to normalcy by the time we get to the end, and then we'll continue to see great growth in Q3 and Q4. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. Kevin, one, for you on that capital trends in the quarter. I think I heard you say strong capital trends, looking at the other line item within ortho; I mean that was 45%, 50%, that's a big number. Is that \u2013 was there any catch-up from last year or what's driving any sense on how Mako placements are trending? Is there an acceleration in the end market? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. As you saw we had a terrific fourth quarter with Mako and that continued into the first quarter. So it was an absolute banner first quarter for Mako, and what we saw really was an acceleration in the international markets. The U.S. continued its tremendous positive momentum, but we saw real pickup. As you know, we proceed total new approval in some new markets at towards the end of last year. And we started to see those Mako installations happening in the first quarter. So it was really Mako around the world that was booming in the first quarter and that gives us a lot of optimism, because that's an early indicator of future implants growth. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys for taking my questions. Neurovascular was very strong this quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you think your end markets grew versus market share gains? Can you give any color on some key products like the Atlas Stents or the Surpass flow diverter? And also it's been growing very, very well in China. Just curious, what's driving that growth and how sustainable do you think that is? Preston Wells : Hey, Pito its Preston. Just wanted to follow-up with on your neurovascular question. I mean, I'd say overall we're really pleased with the double-digit growth and I think certainly, we've seen in the past that that market has been accelerating. But I do think with some of those launches that you mentioned, we are seeing shared gains in that space as well. So those launches that we had throughout 2020, we're really starting to capitalize as we've gotten into 2021. And so seeing good growth across a variety of those items, including flow to varying stands and our aspiration products. As it relates to China, it again same thing as we brought in technologies to those markets and been able to grow there, similar to how we've done in our other markets with neurovascular. And so we really are looking forward to a strong year in total as we think about that neurovascular business. Kevin Lobo : Just to compare, kind of just add one comment. I just think we have an really incredible leadership team of neurovascular. This is not just a one-quarter wonder. I mean, they've been putting up tremendous numbers quarter-after-quarter and as Preston said, the product cycle is really hitting beautifully across all of our categories. So this will be a very strong year. Pito Chickering : Excellent. And as a quick follow-up question that you referenced strength at the end of the quarter for U.S. and Asia is obviously uneasy comps. Can you give us any color of what you saw in the end markets in Europe, in other key markets in March? Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So just in terms of some of those other markets, I mean, I think as we know, Europe was a little bit behind in terms of some of the recovery. I mean, we saw some areas like the UK that might've been a little bit out in front. But certainly as we saw the continued impact on procedural volumes from the fourth quarter, we saw similar impacts in Europe really throughout the quarter. But similar to how we saw the U.S. and some of those other areas, we did see improvements as we ended the quarter. And so again, as Glenn mentioned, our expectation as we go into second quarter is that we're getting back to more normalized levels. Of course, there's some other markets that are out there, like in Latin America and certainly with India that will remain a little bit impacted by the coronavirus restrictions, et cetera. But as far as Europe and in U.S. and especially in Asia-Pacific, as we talk about there, we do expect those markets to get back to more normal levels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. You may proceed Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just two big picture questions for me; one, on ASC's, Kevin, J&J said that about 15% to 20% of hip and knee procedures now being done in ASC's. What are your thoughts on this trend? How are you positioned Stryker to tap into this shift. And I guess everybody's concerned is applications for implant pricing? And I had one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Larry, I would say that 15% to 20% might be a little high, but there's no doubt that the trend is increasing and increasing pretty rapidly. We are delighted with the ASC offense that we put together really over the last two years. We have a unique way that we go to the market for ASC, a new sales organization that we created, and we really bring the best of Stryker because we have everything they need in the ASC. We have guns, we have lights, we have power tools, we have Neptune waste management, we have operating tables, we have hips and knees and sports medicine, and foot and ankle and shoulder [Technical Difficulty] compared to kind of historical norms. And so I think if you take all of those into account in context of that, 8% to 10%, you can get a sense of where we think hips and knees are going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much for taking the questions. I'm just wondering on the guidance and a follow-up on some of the pipeline and some of the investments you're making. So just to talk a little bit about the EPS raise a bit more, I'm curious if it's \u2013 it sounds like part of that is confidence in and returning to growth on the top line. I'm just wondering if that's the case; why not take up the top line guide slightly? As I mentioned I've one follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Well, first of all we're just through the first quarter. And so the \u2013 there's lots of twists and turns here in the next three quarters. I would say that the fundamental thing on the guidance, a couple thing is that it boils down to a lot of the optimism that we're seeing around many of our current businesses. We're definitely not unhappy at all with our Q1 earnings performance or Q1 top line performance. And so I do think that as we accelerated through the quarter and what we're seeing in April, we feel pretty good about our prospects for the remainder of the year. Kevin referenced our order books, which are certainly a good indicator of where future sales could land. So we just feel like there's very solid momentum on that across many, many of our businesses. We also have strong underpin of discipline costs, which is going to help EPS. And I just think that all of that combined with also the progress that we're making on, Wright Medical just gives us the confidence that we felt like we should raise our guidance, which is why we didn't. Matt Miksic : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Then just, you mentioned also in the operating margin sort of puts and takes that you had sort of continued your discipline investment. And I think you said innovation and growth programs, which I think many investors appreciate. You wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on that in terms of basis points, and then also maybe more importantly talk a little bit about what the first or second most important or near-term project or program is in that stack of innovation that we might see say later in the year or for next year? Kevin Lobo : Hey, Matt, I think if you look at it in terms of investment, as we think about the quarter in particular, and even as we go forward, I think you can probably just look at the rate of the percent of sales in terms of the investment that we've made in R&D this quarter compared to previous quarters. And you'll see that it's a bit elevated over our historical norms, which is, I think what Glenn's referencing in terms of additional investments and making sure that we're being disciplined about how we spend against innovation and in our R&D platforms. As it relates to future projects, I mean, the part of the beauty of our model is that the decentralized nature of it allows each of our business units really to focus in on those projects that are important to them as they track for growth as we go forward. And so really that, that innovation and that investment is being made across all of our businesses. And as we have items that make sense to talk about in this type of forum, we'll certainly do so in terms of new launches and key product innovations that be coming to market in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi Bank. You may proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you for taking the question and good afternoon. Two questions [indiscernible] front. What are your debt goals or debt pay down goals? I'm not sure how you're measuring it, whether it is sort of the debt to EBITDA metric over a certain period of time or net debt that you're aiming towards. And then Wright Medical [indiscernible] correctly, that's integrating somewhat faster than expected. And I'd be curious what you see as sort of surprise in that integration? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Hi, Joanne. In terms of debt pay down goals and we've been pretty clear with the rating agencies on this as well. We really look at debt to EBITDA as well as the ratio that we focus on and really bring it back down to kind of what are our historical levels 2.5 times roughly. If you think about the next couple of years, it means a pay down of $2 billion, $2 billion plus in terms of what we'll do. We \u2013 if you think about what we paid-off in the fourth quarter and what we paid-off this quarter, we're about a billion towards that goal. We probably have an opportunity to pay down a little more debt this year that we'll take advantage of too. And so that's where we think we'll land. Once we do that, we think we'll be in a solid territory to sort of accelerate our programs around looking at sort of larger opportunities. But the organization is very focused on cash flow in reaching those debt pay down goals. Glenn Boehnlein : And maybe I'll take the question on, on Wright Medical. I would say we're off to a very good start. So far so very good with the Wright Medical integration its proceeding much more quickly than K2M which was our first overlap deal. And I would say I'm delighted with the products, the people and the pipeline that we've acquired with Wright Medical. And really, if I think back to all the deals we've done in recent history, maybe Nolvadex is the only other deal I would say that's kind of in the same ballpark as this one in terms of the speed of integration, the speed of decision making. We have mixed management teams that are leading a lot of the Wright Medical leadership has come over. So key leadership roles and the momentum is terrific, and we had baked in a certain level of this synergies. And even on the cost side, I think we're making progress a little bit more quickly than we had expected. So overall delighted with very arbitrary medical and the future is very bright. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman from BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Great. Thank you for taking the question. So want to ask first about the U.S. spine market and you flap now the K2M acquisition and so common in kind of your assessment of your spine franchise and your expectations for getting back to market growth in that business? And then my second question is just around you call up the Sage business and it seems like it was very strong this quarter in medical. And so is there \u2013 is there some dynamic of kind of pantry reloading on the expectation that procedures could be picking up sooner? Just how to think about that cadence within that business going forward? Thank you. Preston Wells : Hey, Ryan, it's Preston. I'll take both of those questions. So from a spine perspective, I think overall, we're very encouraged by the performance that we've seen in our spine business over the last several quarters. Certainly it's being enhanced by enabling technologies, certainly our recent acquisition of Mobius being a part of that. And I think the other thing I would just point out to you as we think about spine in relation to some of the other implant businesses; we certainly didn't see the same level of impact as a result of the COVID restrictions, particularly across this last quarter. Like we saw on some of the other implant businesses, which is something to keep in mind when you think about the performance, but overall, like I said, we're encouraged by the performance and we're \u2013 with high expectations in terms of our spine business getting back to market levels and continuing to perform that way. As it relates to this Sage, I think you hit it, I mean, really it's a product that certainly was impacted by the procedural slowdowns. And so as hospitals ramp back-up and get ready for that, the procedures to pick back-up, there's an element of Sage that we'll pick back-up in terms of stocking to get ready. But at the same time, I think it also began to see the flow through that's happening from a stage perspective, as well as, as more and more procedures are done in that catch-up of the recovery process. Ryan Zimmerman : Got it. Thanks for taking questions. Kevin Lobo : Its Kevin, I'd just like to add one comment. I think our medical business sometimes gets a little underestimated and the reason is you have three different components of it. You have the acute care, the bed instructors and we have a brand new bed per acuity that was launched towards the end of last year, that'll have four models, two of those models will be launched a little later this year. That'll drive very strong growth for that business and then you have the emergency care, which is the defibrillators and the district ambulance costs, and then you have the Sage of business. And so you have three different businesses that frankly had \u2013 last year you had a little bit more contribution from acute care and emergency care and not so much from Sage. This year you're going to have a lot more Sage, emergency care is going well and acute care should pick-up as we get into the latter course of this year. So overall it really is a much more stable high-growth business than it was a decade ago, based on the acquisitions of both Physio-Control and... Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you for taking the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. You may proceed. Chris Pasquale : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, one quick one for you, and then one on the business unit. Just wanted to confirm with the guidance, how much of the change in EPS guidance was related to change in expectations for currency versus operational performance? It wasn't clear to me what the components were there? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Chris, we basically incurred some positivity at $0.03 in Q1, and we think the full year will have an impact of $0.05 to $0.10 just there's still some variability out there. So that's where we got it in. Chris Pasquale : I guess, relative to the original guidance. Was there a delta there, or is that the same as you were expecting with the original EPS range? Glenn Boehnlein : There's a really it's wordsmithing, I mean the original guidance we taught it would be $0.01, affirm $0.10 and now we're sort of more thinking that we might see a range of $0.05 to $0.10. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jeffries. You may proceed. Anthony Petrone : Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions, one on robotics, one on Wright Medical. On robotics, just trying to get a sense of sort of the competitive landscape, we're hearing quite a bit about the J&J develops robot launch here pending, and so just wondering if there was any sort of impact in the 1Q numbers, perhaps a bigger selling effort ahead of a competitive launch. And then secondly, on Wright, when we think about sort of settling at mid-single digit growth pre-acquisition that was a high single-digit grower. I'm just wondering if we can sort of break that out between the synergy and pandemic. And so what is the timing to get back to that high single digit growth rate? Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So with regards to your question on robotics, I mean, from our perspective, really nothing's changed in our focus and what you saw in the first quarter really is just a continuation of the effort that we had since we launched Mako and so we're really seeing that the uptick as a result of just selling in our technology. And overall, we really remain bullish about Mako and what it brings. Other competitive systems like VELYS or ROSA haven't slowed us down at all. And if anything, what they've done is they've increased the validation that robotics are going to stay and really demand for Mako and our technology continues to be super strong as we saw by the results we posted. And then also, we believe we have the best solution. And so from a head-to-head comparison it's something that we look forward to with the technologies that are on the market today. As you think about Wright Medical and again the high single digits, I mean, it's all inclusive in there. Obviously, we're coming off of a pandemic or still kind of coming out of the end of the pandemic, so there is certainly some impact there. There are dis-synergies that are associated with the deal itself. And then there is also just the integration happening in terms of the Wright business and our own business through cross-selling and things like that. So, it's not something that we've parsed out in terms of the different components of it. I think what we can expect to see is that as we work through the integration we'll get out of total trauma and extremities business back up to performing above market growth. Anthony Petrone : Yes, thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : The key thing to remember at the middle \u2013 mid single digit growth that includes our existing trauma business. So that wasn't just for the Wright Medical portion right. That's the combined trauma and extremities. And so Wright Medical will be a faster growing component of the combined trauma and extremities business, but obviously wasn't in the first quarter just because of the pandemic. Anthony Petrone : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. You may proceed. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi, guys. First question I know you haven't been providing Mako numbers in recent quarters. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on where U.S. market penetration is today. Any color you can provide and where you think we're at penetration wise from a procedure placement perspective \u2013 from a market perspective would be really helpful. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I mean, obviously, we're not providing specifics on the quarter, but I think if you go back and look at what we said in the fourth quarter that will give you some sense of where we are in total installation base both from a U.S. or a global perspective, and you can make some assumptions about what that might mean U.S. versus international. But if you think about what that total placement is, and you think about the fact that there is the potential for 4,500 or so hospitals that could carry a Mako that just gives you a sense of where we are penetration wise. But even then I would tell you that that many of these hospitals are able to take more than just one. So I think the bottom line with all of that is it's still early days in terms of penetration. So there is a lot of opportunity out there in terms of robotics and taking Mako and taking more than one Mako as we look forward. Steven Lichtman : Got it, great. And then Glenn, you mentioned relative to Wright, obviously integration going better and you're up \u2013 the top line is part of the operating margin confidence also some pull forward of the expense synergies that you were expecting? Or is that still yet to come as well? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I think, it's a fair assessment. We're executing very well on the cost synergies that were planned in our modeling. And so, we are going to see a little bit of that favorability that's flowing through the revised guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you called out a strong China results in the quarter. Could you just maybe talk a little bit in more detail about what you're seeing now over the next 12 months? And what your expectations are moving through 2021? And just sticking with APAC for a second, kind of what's your enthusiasm for Mako in China and Japan? Is 2021 an inflection year for these countries? Or should we see more gradual adoption in the near-term? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So, first of all, China had a terrific first quarter as you know that the pandemic is not really affecting day to day life in China. And they had a very \u2013 obviously in 2019 \u2013 even going back to 2019, we had terrific growth, but obviously last year was very badly affected in the first quarter if you compare to 2020. So China as a whole, we're very small in China relative to other companies, but we grew incredibly fast in very, very high double-digit growth in Q1. The outlook for China for us is still very positive given our lower relative market shares. It will be a very good Mako market with just getting started in China. I would say Japan \u2013 certainly Australia is farther ahead of where we are in China. So it's early days, but very promising, very encouraging. The one negative for China, of course, is this trend towards volume-based procurement, which you've seen in the cardiac stents. And we know that that's going to come down the pipe in effect a couple of our businesses hasn't yet but starting to and there'll be noise around that. But overall China for us still remains a high priority markets and will be a growth market for us just given our relative position, but even as it relates to Mako that'll be carved out of the tendering related to volume-based procurement. So we still have that significant runway for robotics both in Japan and China. Those are going to be both big markets and then we're very excited about our progress in both of those. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you and just a question for Glenn. Glenn, you mentioned momentum continues for cash flow. Could you just give us some more color on your efforts to drive cash flow kind of as discretionary expenses come back? Just how is Stryker focused on cash flow generation today maybe versus 12, 24 months ago? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I think one of the things that we got the whole organization garnered around over the course of 2020 was just the importance of cash flow and good management of that cash flow just so we can operate the company at reduced revenue level levels, but then also just so we could reallocate that cash flow to areas that provide better returns in terms of M&A and things like that. So I do think organizationally we are well positioned relative to manage cash flow. We have efforts ongoing in terms of moving a lot more of our collections to standardized shared service centers. We have efforts in inventory management and working very closely with the businesses, so that we can forecast inventory needs better. We also look at distribution strategies that sort of are more efficient in terms of how much inventory we have to have on hand to serve customers. And then lastly, we are also working with our vendors in terms of accounts payable and how do we have more favorable terms in terms of payment terms on accounts payable. And so all of that is just really tightening up our working capital, certainly will benefit us this year as we look at improving the results of cash flow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. You may proceed. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So I wanted to ask about your guidance. Last quarter you were asked about what the swing factor was between the high and the low end. And you said that basically the big one was how quickly things come back in Q2. If they came back better on the front end, you could be near the high end and on the back end near the low end, if that makes sense. So is that still how you're thinking about it? And based on the trends that you're seeing is that leaning you towards the high or the low end of guidance for the year? Kevin Lobo : Thanks, Matt. So as we think about it again, we provided the range because of the variability that exists. And certainly, as we think about where we're headed, we're happy with what happened in the first quarter. And as we \u2013 with the momentum that we're taking into the second quarter, and certainly if we continue to have great momentum, obviously it means a good thing for us as we think about our overall sales. But we put the guidance range out there for exactly that reason, because there's still a lot of variability that's happening across the different marketplaces. So I think that's how I would think about it. And certainly as we come in to our second quarter results, we'll have another update that we'll be able to talk about that. Matt Taylor : Okay. And then you mentioned a couple of times you've got a strong order book, which is a good sign. I was hoping you could characterize that for us a little bit better in terms of maybe the percentage of your sales that its impact directly or indirectly, could you talk about it as an indicator for the implants and just kind of the timing of that? When does that start to land and how long does it last that help us think about how that impacts the forecast? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so, I think when we talk about our order book, generally, it's in reference because we think about our capital businesses, because those items are being placed in some cases well in advance as you think about our larger capital items or even the smaller capital items, the orders that are coming in there. So it's just the leading indicator as we look at those businesses. And so really when we talk about capital, we've talked about capital before as being about 15% or so being our small capital and about 9% or 10% being our large capital items as we think about as a percent of our total business. So I think if you think about those items, those are the ones that we're talking about when we reference our order book, it generally is impacting us 25 or so percent of our business. And again, it's just the leading indicator as we think about return \u2013 a return to procedures and also just the strength of our customers in terms of their financial positions as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson from Needham and Company. You may proceed. Mike Matson : Hi. I wanted to ask one on M&A. After you did the Wright acquisition, I really haven't seen as many deals and there was a pandemic last year, so it's probably not too surprising given everything that was going on, but how do you kind of balance the need to digest the Wright deal, integrate the \u2013 that company with Stryker versus the funnel for M&A, and just put the valuations on some of these companies out there now? Kevin Lobo : Yes, no, a good question. As we talked about when we did the Wright deal, obviously it was the largest deal in our history. And so one of the things we talked about as well, we've go through the integration of Wright that we would continue to focus on M&A, but the focus that we'll have on M&A will be more of a tuck-in variety. So as we look at placing either smaller products or more technologies into our existing businesses. And so we go back to the end of the year. We had the OrthoSensor acquisition, and then we just talked about today, the TMJ Concepts acquisition. So you'll continue to see those types of acquisitions in the near-term as we continue to go through the integration of Wright and the debt pay down that we've talked about as well. So I think that's how I would think about acquisitions for us as we think about going forward. I mean one key point is that we're always looking. We have dedicated business development teams as part of our commercial business units, and they're always out there evaluating the landscape and looking at targets, so that whenever the opportunity presents itself, we're able to take advantage of it. Mike Matson : Okay, thanks. And then just want to ask one on spine. So you get good growth there on the spine business. And I suspect you're probably outperforming the market, but do you have any sense for the degree to which that that market was affected by the procedural slow down in the first quarter, early part of the first quarter as opposed to the hip and knee market? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So as we think about spine, the only thing that we can look at is what's happened over the last several quarters. And I think what we see with spine, even as we look at our own business, is that it's not as impacted. I mean, it certainly is impacted as there's elective component of it, but it's generally more emergent as we think about spine versus another the hip and knee business, for example. And so, we haven't seen the same level of slowdown as we think about where that lands in regards to the total market. I think as we come through the pandemic, it's just something we're going to have to continue to evaluate and once we get into a more normalized side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. You may proceed. Richard Newitter : Just for Kevin, you mentioned mid single-digit trajectory relative to 2019 for hips and knees. Those are different businesses with different deferral characteristics throughout COVID and they also have different comps in the 2019 period. So I was just curious, should we be thinking of knees as being substantially higher than that mid single digits and maybe hips dragged that down to an average of mid single digits. I'm just trying to get a sense of difference between the two categories, especially given where the backlog is coming? Kevin Lobo : Yes, so, so first of all, I don't want to get too carried away with one month of comp, right. It's a very positive sign. Both are in the mid single digit range. And I'm not going to sort of say, which is higher than the other one. They're both are doing mid single-digit growth versus April of last year. But again, you're talking about 25 days of selling days roughly between two years apart. And so, it's definitely a change from the trajectory we saw in the first three months of the year and a positive change, but I don't want to get too excited about that. It's just an indication, a data point for you that tells you things are improving, volumes are coming back, but it's not really providing you guidance with which hips and knees, which one is going to be performing better than the other one. They're both coming back and that's a good sign overall. Richard Newitter : Okay. Thanks and then just a follow-up. You've mentioned some dynamics in spine relative to the recovery January to March. Could you talk a little bit about some of your other elective in nature procedure areas like sports medicine, maybe EMT and just talk a little bit about what the recovery is looking like there and prospects for back half thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. Those are actually recovering very well, right. Sports medicine, I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks grew double-digits in the first quarter. It actually grew double-digits in the fourth quarter last year. So we're delighted that those procedures are done in surgery centers where you frankly, haven't seen the same degree of slow down as we have in the inpatient hospital. EMT was the most negatively impacted when the pandemic started because they are [indiscernible] procedures. We're seeing that have a nice rebound. And so both of those areas are going to be strong performers and strong contributors to grow in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of from Kaila Krum from Truist Securities. You may proceed. Kaila Krum : Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So can you just speak a little bit in a little bit more detail about the TMJ Concepts acquisition you mentioned on the call, just the rationale, how important or significant that could be just any additional detail there would be helpful? Kevin Lobo : Sure. So as we think about that acquisition, and again it fits the overall strategy that we have in terms of finding products and technologies that are out there and really fitting them into our sales forces hands to help them really go out and serve the surgeons and the customers and patients that they serve. So with TMJ Concepts really it's adding that TMJ prosthesis product to the bag that's allowing us to go in and really service customers and patients that are actually in that position of needing that replacement. Glenn Boehnlein : But I would say overall, it's a very small deal. So this is not something that's going to really hit your radar screen for the overall size of Stryker. It's very meaningful to our CMF business, very meaningful to the oral maxillofacial surgeon, but not a big mover of the needle for overall Stryker. And so, you'll see that as we report our results. We'll report that in the acquisition column, you'll be able to see that, but it's a very small nothing that's going to be really meaningful to the overall strength. Kaila Krum : Got it. Okay, helpful. And then just high level, Kevin, I'd love to just hear what you're hearing from your hospital customers in recent months. I mean, you mentioned you're seeing more of a shift to ASCs. Are there any other sort of interesting trends in the market you're hearing about that have surprised you either to the positive or negative and recent dialogue with your customers? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Nothing, I wouldn't say surprising Kaila, but I would say is that the shift to the ASC, every hospital you speak to has programs underway. And so, that was already happening prior to the pandemic. It is definitely accelerating. That's probably the most notable thing I would say. The other thing is that they're actually in pretty good financial position. So unlike prior crises that we've gone through, whether it was the financial meltdown or other issues, the hospital liquidity is actually very good. And so, there was a pause for a little while on some of the capital, certainly the smaller capital, but as procedures are coming back, we're seeing that through our order book that hospitals are in actually very good financial position and better than frankly I would have expected when the pandemic first hit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Jeff Johnson from Baird. You may proceed. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Two just clarifying questions if I could. Preston, you were talking about the spine market and good to hear that it's a little more emergent and maybe not as pressured as much in 1Q as the hip and knee market, but I'm assuming the pass-through payments on SpineJack helped a decent amount with 1Q. So when I look at you're down 2% U.S. spine versus the down 7%, 8% U.S. hip and knee. Is that about the right way to think about a six point differential in core spine versus hip and knee market growth at this point? Or would that differential be less than that if we kind of exclude some of those benefits, I'm assuming you got on the interventional side? Preston Wells : Yes. I mean, I think, it's again being that we're right in the middle of the pandemic, there's a lot of regional variability with this. I mean, I think any \u2013 to take any number in absolute is probably not the right bet, but I think certainly there is that gap there that \u2013driven by that less emergent impact if you think about hips and knees versus spine. So, I mean, I think if you take some gap in that small single digit range, that's probably about right. Jeff Johnson : All right, fair enough. And Kevin, I thought it\u2019s interesting your comments on the ASCs and the five business units typically be involved in a contract. I think historically, and correct me if I'm wrong, but historically you said there is not a lot of bundling that goes out at the hospital level, cross business units, things like that at this point, obviously in the ASCs that seems to be happening more. Does that mean your incremental share gains at ASC should be even greater than what we've seen historically on the hospital side for you guys? It just seems like you're so well positioned there given the diversification of the business model. Kevin Lobo : Yes, it's a great point. There is a very different buying that occurs at the ASC than it does in the hospital. The hospitals have very elaborate procurement divisions and departments and they buy by service line and it's very decentralized. The ASC is a very simple sort of customer that you have to interact with. They're not as many people. They can't perceive 22 Stryker sales people. They don't want to, and that's not the way they want to do business. So we have a different offense for the ASC. And fortunately we have a portfolio for the orthopedic ASC, which includes sports that is just perfect for what they're looking for. And so, yes, we've adapted our offense. We have the portfolio, but it is a very different buying pattern. The hospital isn't as interested frankly and looking across our different divisions and hasn't historically been as interested, but the ASC customers certainly is. And the good news is we've adapted our offense. If we had continued with our \u2013 the same way we used to sell, we wouldn't be having the success that we're having now. And really I'm optimistic about this continuing in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hi, this is Korinne on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one quick one for us. Can you talk a little bit about how Mako hip is going and how you expect it to perform for the remainder of the year? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So the Mako hip application if you remember, we launched it last year, but we really couldn't get it out to all of our customers because of pandemic. We've got roughly 50%, maybe a little bit more than 50% of the accounts have the new software, so it's not as simple as just sort of doing an upload over the web of the software. We actually have to go to the account, put the software on and do it in servicing with our customers because there is new information they have to learn. So there's actually a training regimen that goes with it. So, right now, we're excited about the procedure growth in hip is increasing as more and more accounts have the software installed and are in serviced by our Stryker team. This will continue through the second quarter, probably through a good part of the third quarter before all of the accounts have the new hip software, but the feedback from the surgeon customer is terrific. There's \u2013 it takes less time to register, so that speeds up the overall procedure time. And there is some very valuable information such as pelvic tilt, but surgeons find that very beneficial to make sure they're managing like length discrepancies. And so, the feedback again very positive, but we're still in the throes of this implementation and it does take time because it requires that that high touch in servicing and due to the pandemic we haven't been able to move as quickly as we would like in all of our accounts and all of our regions. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Kevin, just two questions on the knee business. First just, you've had unprecedented success with your strategy of pairing robotics with the triathlon implant. Do you see any knee now that \u2013 the other three of the big four have introduced robotic platforms to pivot from that strategy and how do you see implants evolving from here, the implants the robotics era? And then the second question is just \u2013 sorry, the ASC question, but for knees, are you overrepresented in the ASCs? That's our assumption just wanted to sanity check that do you have a higher share at ASCs than the rest of the U.S.? And you just received approval for patient specific instrumentation for the triathlon. And can you help us to understand how that improves your competitive positioning, particularly in ASCs? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Okay, great. There are a few questions in there, so I'll try to cover them all. So, first of all, the ASC is an area that we welcome. We're having success with Mako, frankly, in the ASC, more success than I would have imagined, honestly, two years ago when we initially signed the deal with Conformis, that deal was designed to really have a very simple solution for the ASC customer that is not using Mako. And there will be ASCs, the deals \u2013 some of the deals we've won don't involve a Mako where they will use manual procedures. That's where this solution will be terrific because it requires much less sterilization and is really custom designed for the ASC. So, we're excited to get that FDA approval and we look forward to being able to offer that to our ASC customers. I think you asked about market share. I don't know, Preston, do you have a feel for whether we're over-indexed in ASCs? I think it's fairly representative at this point. Preston Wells : Yes, I think it's fairly representative at this point. I mean, obviously, it's a growing segment, but I think that are representative right now. Kevin Lobo : Yes, and it's still early, but we like our chances of being able to do very well. And as it relates to the implants, I would tell you in the short-term no real need to change anything. We're going to continue to have high \u2013 high adoption of robotics. We have cementless that continues to grow as we talked about in the fourth quarter, over 40% of our knees are cementless, but that still has a long runway to go. Longer-term I do think of different types of implants that are more bone sparing that don't use [indiscernible], but those will require IDE trials. But it's that I think something that is able to keep the ACL in place, it is something \u2013 is an area that we're exploring more from a science standpoint. So nothing that'd be launched imminently, but I do think that will be the future is new kinds of implants that are thinner, that are occurred that only a robot will be able to \u2013 to be able to implement into a patient. So that's kind of the longer-term future, but in the near-term, let's say call it the next two, three years, I think we're very pleased with the portfolio we have and a long runway for continued growth. Josh Jennings : Thanks a lot. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Preston with an update on the Wright Medical integration. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Please note that our press release contains our results versus both 2020 and 2019. For this call, our commentary will be based on our performance versus 2019, which we believe provides a more relevant point of comparison. For the quarter we posted organic sales growth of 9.3% reflecting growth versus 2019 for all our major businesses. This strong result was driven by standout performances from neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine and our U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. Each of these posted very strong double-digit growth. International organic growth outpaced the U.S. 14.2% despite COVID challenges in some countries. We posted double-digit growth in most regions, including excellent results in South Pacific, China, Canada, South Korea and many countries in Western Europe. We were also pleased to see the continued rebound in elective procedures as both hips and knees saw quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement and both returned to growth. Also now that we have a fuller appreciation of Wright Medical, we are delighted to have it within the Stryker family. With our first half organic growth of 7.1% combined with continued recovery of elective procedures, a strong order book across our capital businesses and new product innovations, we have increased confidence in the full-year outlook. This is reflected in our upward narrowing of organic sales guidance to 9% to 10% compared to 2019. Our sales performance carried through the rest of our results with strong margin performance and adjusted EPS growth and cash flow conversion of over 100% in the quarter. Through the remainder of the year, we do expect a discipline increase in spending to support our future growth expectations. Our bullish sales outlook combined with ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration has resulted in a raised full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.25 to $9.40 a share. I continue to be impressed with the resiliency of our people and culture, which positions us well for successful 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on the second quarter performance of our combined trauma and extremities business, including an update on the ongoing integration of Wright Medical.  During the quarter our combined worldwide trauma and extremities business, including Wright Medical had a strong performance growing 7% compared to 2019. The performance in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in our U.S. trauma and upper extremities businesses. The U.S. businesses were benefited by the recovery from COVID-19 related restrictions, which continues to outpace the rest of the world, as well as the ongoing execution of the U.S. selling integration. The trauma business unit was positively impacted by the reopening of economies and a continued strong performance of key products including T2 Alpha and the minifrac [ph] plating system. Our U.S. upper extremities business which remains number one in shoulder arthroplasty grew strong double-digits in the quarter behind continued strength within reverse arthroplasty portfolio with perform reverse and revision driving the growth. The upper extremities performance in the quarter was enhanced by the continued adoption of our BLUEPRINT planning software with approximately 50% of total shoulder cases completed using BLUEPRINT. As a result of the strong performance of our trauma and extremities business which grew approximately 5% in the first half of the year, we are confident in the combined business to grow at least 6% for the full year when compared to 2019. We are now about nine months into the integration of Wright Medical and we remain very pleased with the progress and efficiency at which the team is moving through the integration. The U.S. integration is pacing ahead of our expectations, and cross selling has begun in a limited capacity. We expect to continue to execute on our cross selling priorities during the second half of the year as we work to fortify the supply chain and the processes to support cross selling activities. Outside the U.S., the teams have successfully executed integration plans in several key markets, including the UK, Germany, France, Japan and China with further countries to follow into 2022. In addition to commercial activities, we are also executing on the integration of other operational areas including the consolidation of distribution and sales offices, harmonization of key operational processes and executing on our manufacturing site strategy. Within R&D, the team also continues to make progress on aligning the long-term portfolio, pipeline strategies, and harmonize design processes. While the team has moved through the integration, they have also remained focused on executing the critical existing projects in the pipeline. This includes the recent launch of the new Tornier Perform Humeral System, which offers clinical solutions for the simplest and most complex arthroplasty procedures and delivers on our mission to make healthcare better for surgeons and the patients they serve. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Preston. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 9.3 in the quarter. The second quarter included the same number of selling days as Q2 2019 and Q2 2020. Compared to 2019, pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.6% versus Q2 2020 pricing was 0.5% unfavorable. Foreign currently had a favorable 1.5% impact on sales. During the quarter we saw a recovery ramp of elective procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in most geographies. However, the recovery ramp of elective procedures continues to be variable by region and geography and have a more pronounced impact on our orthopedic and spine implant business. For the quarter U.S. organic sales increased by7.5%, reflecting the recovery of our procedural business and continued strong demand for Mako, medical products and neurovascular products. During the quarter we had strong sequential improvement in all our U.S. businesses. International organic sales showed strong growth of 14.2%. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.25 increased 13.6% from 2019 reflecting sales growth and operating margin expansion partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition and a somewhat higher quarterly effective tax rate. Our second quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopedics had constant currency sales growth of 26% and an organic sales growth of 6.7%, including an organic growth of 8% in the U.S. This reflects a ramp up in elective procedures especially in knees and trauma and extremities. Our knees business grew 7.5% in the U.S. reflecting a strong bounce back as the COVID related restrictions were lifted. Other orthopedics grew 26.5% in the U.S. primarily reflecting strong demand for our Mako robotics platform partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally Orthopedics grew 4% organically which reflects sequential improvement as the COVID-19 impacts have started to ease in Europe, strong momentum in Mako internationally and strong performances in Australia. For the quarter, our trauma and extremities business, which includes Wright Medical delivered 7% growth on a comparable basis. In the U.S. comparable growth was 12.5%, which included double-digit growth in our upper extremities and trauma businesses. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.3%, which included 6.4% growth in the U.S. Instruments had a U.S. organic sales growth of 29% primarily related to growth in smoke evacuation, lighted instruments, and skin closure products, partially offset by slower growth in power tools. As a reminder, during the second quarter of 2019 Instruments had a very strong growth of approximately 19%. Endoscopy had US. organic sales growth of 6% reflecting strong performances in our sports medicine, general surgery, and video products. The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 13.4% reflecting continued double-digit performance in our emergency care business. Internationally MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.9%, reflecting strong growth in the endoscopy, instruments and medical businesses across Europe, Canada and Australia. Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 15.5%. This growth reflects double-digit performances in all four of our neurotech businesses; CMF, neurovascular, neurosurgical and EMC [ph]. This also reflects very strong growth in our neurovascular business of approximately 30%. Our U.S. neurotech business posted an organic growth of 17.3%, highlighted by strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps, Maxface [ph], cryotherapy and nasal implants. Additionally, our U.S. Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of our products including hemorrhagic flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally Neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 28.8%. This performance was driven by strong demand in China and other emerging markets, as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was favorable approximately 15 basis points from second quarter 2019. Compared to the second quarter in 2019 gross margin was primarily impacted by business mix and acquisitions primarily offset by price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.4% of sales which was slightly better than the second quarter of 2019. This reflects our continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage offset by the impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.9% of sales, which is 5 basis points improvement over the second quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum combined with the disciplined ramp up in cost, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. Based on our positive momentum, we continue to reiterate our up margin guidance for the year of 30 to 50 basis points improvement over 2019, excluding the impact of Wright Medical. Related to other income and expense, as compared to the second quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment earned on deposits and an increase in interest expense resulting from the additional debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 17% and was impacted by our mix of U.S., non-U.S. income and some adverse discrete tax items included in our provision to return adjustments. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 15.2%. For the full year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5% with some variability in the remaining quarters, including a slightly lower rate in the third quarter and a more normalized rate in the fourth quarter. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter we fully repaid the $400 million of term loan debt related to the borrowings incurred for the acquisition of Wright Medical. Year-to-date we have paid down $1.15 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. And now I will provide a summary of our revised guidance. Based on our performance and sales ramp in the second quarter, as well as our capital orders pipeline, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for trauma and extremities to be at least 6% for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Consistent with the upper range of our previous guidance, net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $0.10 in the full-year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first six months and including consideration of our improved full-year Wright Medical performance impact, controlled spend ramp to facilitate growth and continued positive recovery outlook, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.25 to $9 40. And now we will open the call up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Your line is open. Robert Hopkins : Well, thanks and good afternoon, and congrats on such strong performance across the entire business. You could beat down essentially every metric. So I just have two questions and I'll state them upfront in the interest of time. The first question Kevin is for you. I'm just wondering how you've kind of framed your thoughts on the outlook for your hip and knee business in the back half given the rise in COVID cases that we're seeing? That's question number one. And then I would love you to comment also is question number two on the acceleration in Neurovascular, maybe just give a little more color, I mean was that market share you think, was that, was there strength in ischemic and hemorrhagic, just kind of looking for a little more color on the acceleration there? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Sure, thank you Bob. First on the hip and knee, what we're seeing is really a gradual increase we've seen throughout the year of return of elective procedures. These are deferrable procedures that need to be done at some point. And yes, with the Delta variant we are starting to see pockets of disruption, but overall the hospitals are very capable of being able to deal with this. And we're seeing in markets like Latin America and other markets the situation is actually improving. So overall, we know there is going to be some disruption and that is baked into our guidance, but we believe with the momentum that we have across not only our implant business, but as well as our capital businesses and we feel pretty confident enough to raise the bottom end of our full year sales guidance. As it relates to Neurovascular, if you look at that business we had an outstanding first quarter. It was around 27%, so this is 30%, so it's not really a huge acceleration. I would say, we really have a great product cycle going on right now across flow diverting stents, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic coils, our aspiration catheters. So we really have the bases covered and we're having fantastic growth really globally, including terrific performances in Asia Pacific. So I do expect that we will continue to have very strong performance throughout the rest of this year. Robert Hopkins : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Robert Marcus : And I'll also add my congrats on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe two questions from me, one to start off, we saw a nice performance down the MedSurg business and throughout medical. There's a lot of new product launches going on here, so I just would like to get a sense of what the key drivers are? How the ProCuity Bed launch is going and what you're seeing in terms of the capital equipment, health of the market out there? Preston Wells : Hey Robbie, it is Preston. Just in terms of capital overall and we continue to see a pretty stable capital environment and if we've seen that really through the first couple of quarters and really evidenced by the continued strong sales in Medical as you'd said and also of course with our Mako technology. As it pertains specifically to Medical, so obviously we have the ProCuity Bed which I'll talk about in just a second, but we also have really strong performances out of our emergency care business. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters as well and so that continues to be very strong and it's just been an uptick there really in the in the U.S. and outside the U.S. With regards to ProCuity itself, the team is very pleased with how that launch has gone and started. We've really gotten a lot of awareness out there. We certainly have a lot of engagement from our customers, and we're starting to see building momentum in orders and sales in the U.S. and then starting to kick off that launch outside the U.S. as well. So we really expect that ProCuity is going to continue to be a driver for Medical really for the remainder of this year and as we go into next. Robert Marcus : Great and maybe for Glenn or Kevin, whoever wants to take it, I know you guys don't guide quarterly, but one of the concerns we've heard from investors over the quarter is that we're still in an environment without normal seasonality and concerns around maybe excessive weakness in third quarter from people coming out of lockdowns, vacations with doctors et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about the progression from second to third and third to fourth quarter and if we're already back to normal seasonality or when we might be able to expect that? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks for the question. Robbie, as you know, Q3 tends to be seasonally our softest quarter, but I would assume that this year's seasonality will be very similar to what you've seen in prior years, and the talk about vacation, I've heard some of those comments. I really think that's noise, and then really that could delay maybe a procedure from one month to another month, but likely within the same quarter. So I expect normal seasonality, as you've seen in prior years. Robert Marcus : Great, I appreciate it Kevin. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks for taking the questions. The update on Wright was encouraging. It certainly sounds like the upper extremities piece continues to do very well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in lower extremities? That was probably the more challenging piece to integrate, curious how that business did versus 2019? Kevin Lobo : Yes, thank you Robbie. So first of all, sorry, Chris, thank you Chris. First of all, I would say that the total ankle business did very well in the second quarter. As you know, the rest of foot and ankle is much more discretionary. The podiatric volumes are coming back, so it was certainly a better quarter in Q2 then Q1, but it is lagging a little bit, just like we're seeing with spine and with hips and knees, it is a bit more elective those foot medical procedures, but I'm very pleased with the stability of our sales force, the leadership that we put in place and as elective procedures comes back we do expect that will continue to grow. It was a market improvement. We're not seeing the kind of disruption we saw early on with K2M through that integration. So I'm very bullish on Wright overall. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, delighted to have this company within our portfolio. I think I have a deeper appreciation, we knew it was a good company when we acquired it and frankly I think it's even better than we thought. Chris Pasquale : That's helpful. And then the color on Mako continues to sound very bullish, but the other ortho business probably didn't improve sequentially as much as the other piece of the business. Can you help us to resize the bone cement headwinds there and maybe give us a sense for what did Mako capital contributions look like? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I mean, as you mentioned Mako continues to be very strong and so that was one of the businesses for sure over the last 12 months really we've seen continued strength. So that's why you won't see necessarily that same sequential improvement that we're seeing in some of the other businesses. With regards to bone cement, of course that's an area that has been declining, was certainly impacted by the pandemic and so we'll be a detractor as we think about that overall category. We don't really provide a breakout of those, but just thinking about in terms of Mako continuing to grow and offset by some declines from a bone cement standpoint. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jeffries. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Thanks, I'll also add another great congratulations on another great quarter. The first one from me would be on deferred backlog procedures some of your competitors is recently even as this quarter are sort of putting numbers against that and I am sort of wondering if there's a number internally at Stryker that you could share on specific to the hip and knee business, what amount of deferred backlog is still out there and how long do you think that will be a driver for the business? And the second one I'll put up there as well on Wright, you mentioned Kevin, second half cross synergy selling potential into the second half and would assume that extends into next year, just sort of trying to quantify that is, is that a couple of 100 basis points and is that net of the synergies? Thanks again. Kevin Lobo : Yes, so first with regards to your question on the deferred backlog, we don't have a specific number. I mean, there's a lot of variables that are going into trying to figure out what that is. What we do know is certainly over the last year that we haven't had the same level of procedures that we would have expected to as a result of the pandemic, and so it's super hard to predict exactly which percentages of patients that are back are from that different backlog or that are new patients. What we do know is that surgeons are continuing to try to work through as many patients as possible, finding different opportunities to add capacity into the scheduling or into their opportunity to perform those procedures. And so we don't expect that we're going to see any sort of outside growth figures that happened in any one particular quarter or month, but that's something that we expect that we're going to be working through this backlog over the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a tailwind for us really over the next several quarters and into 2022 for sure. What you think about is thinking about your other question with regards to Wright Medical, the cross selling component is something that, as I mentioned, is we're pleased with the start of that. It's early in the process. We're expecting that as you mentioned to continue for the rest of this year and into next year. We haven't provided a specific size of that opportunity, but it's baked within the overall guidance that we've provided for the overall combined trauma and extremities business, which as I mentioned we expect to grow at least 6% compared to 2019. That also does include the synergy component as well. Anthony Petrone : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Thanks for taking my question. From my side Kevin, maybe on Mako, is there pieces to be made around utilization on robotic systems is having changed, has the environment ground utilization and how these systems are being used post pandemic hasn't changed at all and have you seen an increase in utilization? Kevin Lobo : Thanks Vijay. No we have not seen really any change in utilization post pandemic. The gating factor really is being able to do the procedures and having the flow of the patients related to overall hospital operations, but so far we haven't seen any change. We are seeing a lot more demand for Mako in the ambulatory surgery centers. As you know, a lot of volume is starting to shift towards surgery centers and for us it's been a real tailwind. Our ASC offense is performing extremely well. And so there are a larger percentage of our Makos that are going into surgery centers, but that's been the only dynamic we've seen change. No real change in their procedure utilization. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful Kevin and maybe one for Glenn. Glenn, on gross margins here, I know you have right share in Kakuro [ph] but even adjusted for mix share, I mean it looks like your gross margins have held up much better versus your peers, who have been calling out shipping cost manufacturing variances, and it's also kind of reflected in this set guidance here margins for back half. We're at the annual operating margins or about 2019 levels which doesn't seem to be the case with your peers. Is there anything that's different about Stryker, how do you guys manage your P&L better, I'm curious of what's driving the margin performance versus your peers? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes I can't necessarily speak to our peers per se, but I will say, your question is maybe music to the ears of our GQO [ph] Group, and they have put a lot of focus in driving improved margins and also driving really good fixed cost leverage, and we will start to see that show up in our gross margins. We're still not guiding on gross margin, so I will say, we'll see that benefit but we will also see the benefit of mix come through which right now Wright Medical is a little bit of that influence that we're seeing on the margins. Offsetting those will be will be price, which typically is going to be the biggest thing. We'll still see that in the minus 1% range for the full year and we fully expect that that pricing impact will be roughly offset by a lot of that positivity that we are seeing and also the mix factor related to Wright Medical. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I'd just like to add one comment, so as you probably are hearing across not just med tech industry but broadly, there is pressure on raw material input costs, and I'm delighted with the way that our organization has been able to offset those with a lot of other savings initiatives, efficiency initiatives, and purchasing initiatives which has been kind of in the works for the last couple of years, but we've really built tremendous capabilities now. Something I haven't been able to speak about frankly in prior years, but we really have the organization humming right now, and so we are able to offset some of the challenges that others are experiencing, and we're also experiencing with electronics and some certain components and feel really good about our supply chain resiliency. Vijay Kumar : Yes, that's clearly shown up in the numbers here Kevin versus your peers. Thanks guys, congrats. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matthew Miksic : Great, thanks so much. So one followup on robots and I just had one question on just those trends and mix that you're seeing and in the U.S. news in particular. On Mako, obviously congrats on all the great results and momentum, up sequentially off a very strong Q1, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit of maybe about the color on any change in mix for placements versus sales or in particular if you are starting to see any sort of cross effects between upper extremities and the robot is these two sides kind of move towards convergence in that new application whenever that comes to 24 months from now? And I have one quick followup. Preston Wells : Hey Matt, it is Preston. Just in terms of robots and mix, I mean one of the things that we identified approximately a year ago was that we were starting to see a bit of a trend towards financing. We haven't seen any significant changes in that approach or in that mix for the last year, so no big changes from a mix standpoint as we think about Mako and how we're selling Mako in the market. With regards to convergence, again we're still not seeing anything there. We've talked a lot about our excitement of a potential with Mako and shoulder, but nothing new to report in that area at this point. Matthew Miksic : Okay, and then just on the knee business. One of the things, one of your competitors talked about was sort of a heavier mix in primaries versus revisions I guess given that revisions were a bit more of an acute emergent. They are ever more emergent procedures or more of those during the pandemic maybe than primary in some areas, one if you're seeing something like that or any demographic mix shifts just because of what we've been through and the types of patients that we're get needed since nine months ago versus those that are coming through now, any color would be great? Preston Wells : Yes man, nothing specific to report in that area. I mean, the one thing that we have seen throughout the pandemic is variability, and so certainly by geography and by area you're getting a lot of variability. So, again, nothing that I would I would specifically point you to in terms of our mix. Matthew Miksic : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of Citi. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I have to two really. We've talked for years about a movement towards the ASC. Are you seeing that accelerate or the same or is there any color that you can put around that? Kevin Lobo : , : Joanne Wuensch : But when you say you have a product for that ship it's not just a robot, but I would assume that you're building out a whole ASC suite, is that the right way to think about it? Kevin Lobo : Yes Joanne, the right way to think about it is, we have virtually everything they need for an orthopedic surgery center from building out the suites with the booms and the lights and the room design, to the operating table, to the beds and stretchers that are required, to the power tools and the flight helmets that they wear, all the implants from foot and ankle procedures, all the way to shoulder, including hips and knees, sports medicine procedures. Just think about our portfolio it absolutely covers the gamut of what they need in those surgery centers. So that really makes life easy for an operator in ASC to be able to contract with one company to cover such a huge portion of the procedures that are being done. So our portfolio really lines up beautifully for that. We also you may have read recently that we have this deal with conformance that we worked on a couple years ago. We have started launched our first few cases of a very, very simplified streamlined offering that provides less sterilization, we call it kind of a knee in a box. The official name of it is Triathlon AS-I with personalized cutting guides for the procedure. And so that was designed specifically for the ASC and that's now launched, but frankly a few years ago we didn't realize that Masko would be popular in the surgery center as proving to be. So we now have both said that we cannot, because some surgery centers won't own have a robot, but yes it involves a huge portion of our portfolio across some of our MedSurg products as well as our implant businesses. Joanne Wuensch : That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question has to do with M&A. In October, you're rounding the two year mark announcement of Wright Medical, does that change your thinking and timing [indiscernible]? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, Joanne, you're right. It is rounding the two-year mark on Wright Medical. However, we're only nine months into sort of the cash flow impact of buying Wright Medical. And so, as we announced at the time of the acquisition, we were going to focus on debt reduction and sort of tuck-in kind of M&A. And so that really is what we've been doing and you've seen it over the last nine months, we've paid down just, a little over $1 billion of debt this year. We'll continue to look for opportunity to do that as we move forward. But we're ahead of the schedule that we thought we'd be on for debt paydown, so that's good. And then honestly, our BD teams are working and looking at smaller tuck-in M&A deals, which we think actually provide the most sort of shorter term growth upside. And so we're excited as they bring us new deals to look at sort of in that kind of size and category. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two robotic questions from me. First, on Mako, I'd love to hear about the OUS rollout, new geographies how that's going places like Japan, I think you're waiting for China, hopefully I don't have those two backwards and just color on the mix, US, OUS of Mako placements? And I had one follow up. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks, Larry. Certainly our OUS business has picked up. As you saw in the pandemic, the U.S. business continued very strong on Mako, but our OUS business did slow down and that's ramping back up again. We are fully operational with both Japan and China on all three applications, same with Brazil, as well as Russia. And so Japan is really starting to accelerate, which we're quite excited about. China has started. We still have, it's a little bit behind Japan. Brazil, we now have our first few sales in Brazil, so that's probably one of the later ones, and Russia as well. So we're in the early stages in those four markets and the demand is very high from surgeons, which is exciting. Brazil was delayed a little bit by COVID, but we are starting to build momentum there as well. So it's very exciting. The surgeons, it's kind of taking us back to when we launched Mako total knee here in the United States. There's high demand for it and you should expect strong performances in the quarters ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And from my related robotic question, Kevin, you guys have started talking more publicly about evaluating, having people at Stryker evaluating surgical robotics. So my question is, how important is it for Stryker to participate in this market at some point? And how do you want investors to think about the kind of investment that it might take to be competitive in that market? Thanks for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Okay, thanks Larry. I assume by that question you're talking about general surgery, robotics. Lawrence Biegelsen : Yes, sorry about that. Kevin Lobo : Yes, no problem. Just want to make sure that was clear. I would say there's really no need for us to be in general surgery, robotics. As you can see, we're running a very good business at Stryker. It is a big market that has big growth potential, but it's something that like other adjacencies that are attracted to us be it areas I've spoken about in the past, like neuromodulation, or peripheral vascular, this is in an attractive adjacency. A pathway forward is not obvious and not clear at this time, but something we'll continue to look at, but it's not something we have to be in. But if the right opportunity presents itself, and we think we can build a strong business, we'll certainly make a move, but not obvious at this point. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking my questions. The first one that has -- a little bit guidance that you provided, can you give us color on where gross margins and SG&A sort of you exiting the year as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019? Kevin Lobo : Sure, I won't speak specifically to guidance on gross margin or necessarily SG&A. I guess what I can tell you is that, as we look at gross margin, we probably would plan on more orthopedic business, maybe impacting that gross margin, but that will be dependent on continued ramp in those businesses. On SG&A, we aren't fully ramped in terms of what I would call a normalized spend. And so as we look to continue sort of fueling the growth, as we ramp back up, we'll probably see increases in SG&A over the course of this year. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. And then we submitted a lot of hospital systems during the quarter. We talked about a pretty significant move of orthopedics from inpatient to outpatient, but not necessarily into the ASC which obviously get a lot of investor attention. As the certain moved into the outpatient department of hospitals, does it impact surgeon selections of the products at all or has it no impact from the move? Kevin Lobo : Yes, no we're not seeing any impact on implant choice, moving to the hospital outpatient, or even frankly to the surgery center. Thus far, we're seeing surgeons continue to operate with the same implants, regardless of which facility they're operating in. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum of Truist Securities. Your line is open. Kaila Krum : Great. Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Just for Wright Medical, you're saying you're confident that the combined business will grow at least 6% this year. Can you just speak to any more detail around sort of the recent drivers in this business? Are you guys seeing any benefit from dislocation associated with the recent impact of the spin off? And then, I guess, is there any reason why that 6% couldn't be 8% to 10% growth next year? Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks, Kaila. What I'd tell you is we're really excited about the upper extremities business, it was growing very, very fast before, the acquisition that's continuing to really sing, especially in the United States. And we've just launched a new product, which will provide extra fuel to the fire. And then on the lower extremity side, we knew that the foot and ankle was going to be a tougher integration, but it's going well. They're a little bit more elective, those procedures, but the total ankle is doing extremely well. So overall, the product portfolio is performing well. Our sales forces are integrating well. The U.S. integration is ahead of schedule. OUS is going to take a little longer and we knew that these countries take a little longer with the distributor arrangements that we have in place before they fully hit their stride. But if you recall, when we started the year, we said low to mid-single-digit growth on a combined basis, and we sort of moved it up to mid single and now we're kind of thinking it's really going to be six plus percent for this year. And you should assume if this continues, and the elective procedures on the lower extremities ramps up that we should have a very good year next year. And also our core trauma business is actually having a very good year as well. So overall feeling very good about it. We're not going to give guidance for next year, but I think you can tell by our total network feeling very optimistic about the future of our trauma and extremities business. Kaila Krum : Great, thanks. Thanks, Kevin. And then I guess on the spine market, can you just compare or contrast sort of what you've seen in terms of how the recovery is progressing this category may be compared with some of the other areas of Orthopedics? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, Kaila, just as we think about spine in comparison to other ortho areas, we haven't seen a significant difference in that recovery. I think I've mentioned before, variability really being the key word and so again, it's just been different pockets of disruption and opportunity as well. And so, nothing significant that I would say that we've seen in terms of the recovery for spine, it's been different than what we've seen in our other elective areas. Kaila Krum : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer and company. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi guys. Certainly first to talk about your spine business and how you are feeling about the state of that business, so what's your outlook for the underlying growth and what are your latest thoughts and timing on robotics into spine? Kevin Lobo : Yes, so in terms of underlying growth and we don't break out guidance in terms of as we think about spine, but we do expect that market and that business to continue to accelerate as the recovery happens in the back half of the year. With regards to robotics, I mean, we've talked about this before is of our key areas of focus for robotics and applications that are next. Spine is one of those and so we continue to move down that path with a couple of different options, looking at Mako, but also through our Mobius acquisition and the Cardan Robotics, some opportunities there. We don't have a timeline that we are sharing at this point and so it's something that we'll continue to update you on as we make progress in that area. Steven Lichtman : Okay, perfect. And then just secondly here with the worker center in a bulk year, for I think about six months, any update or thoughts on a smart implant coming from that acquisition? Kevin Lobo : No, nothing new to report at this point. I mean, obviously, it's still fairly new in terms of the acquisition into the organization. We still do believe in smart implants and smart devices and that they will have a role to play in orthopedics. And so as we -- same similar as with robotics, as we get further down that pathway, it's something that we will certainly keep you updated on. Steven Lichtman : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Matson of Needham. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. This is David on for Mike. The first one is just on ASC, just given the different dynamic there maybe there's more critical when show plan. Does that ASC market need a separate sales force and strategy or do you think you can leverage the current sales network? Kevin Lobo : Yes, we have a very custom designed approach to selling to the ASCs. It is not something we have to elaborate on, on this call, but I would say it has required a different approach. And we're really excited about the way our offense is working in the market. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then, I guess on Mako, I think, J&J talked about the [indiscernible] launch in the U.S., so just expectations over the next call it 12 to 18 months? And thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes, well, expectations for us, I would say we expect Mako to continue to do very, very well. As you've seen, with other competitive entrants into the market, it only validates that robotics is here to stay in orthopedics and so we'd like our chances. We know we have an outstanding solution that delivers great results, which is why hospitals are buying their second and third and fourth Makos. And so we welcome the comparison. It's early days for them. And we just like the fact that robotics is going to continue to grow within orthopedics. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed of Barclays. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hi, everybody, thanks for the question. I realized that China's a small part of your business, but just curious what you're seeing on the ground there with the China tenders and the volume based procurements there. I think that was supposed to happen at some point here in the next few months and if there was an update on that front? Kevin Lobo : Hey, Travis, thanks for the question. In terms of the VDP in China, it is something that's ongoing. We don't have any major updates at this point is we're waiting on feedback on the process. I think one thing to note, that you mentioned is certainly China is a smaller part of our business. And then as we focus on the products that are actually, potentially under the tenders, there's an even smaller component of our business. So just something to keep in mind as we think about the overall impact that could be coming from VDP on our business. So we expect to hear back something later in the third quarter. And at that point in time, we'll take a look at it. The one thing that we know is just based on the timing we don't expect it to have any significant impacts on our 2021 numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and it will be something that we will contemplate as we go into 2022. Travis Steed : All right, that's helpful, thank you. And I just wanted to get an update on the sports medicine business specifically. I know you had been growing double digits, just curious if there's any additional color you can add there both in U.S. and OUS? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, so certainly OUS it's a much smaller business. I would say within the U.S. the tailwind of the shift to the ASC and RSC [ph] offenses, in addition to great cadence of new products has really fueled very strong growth. And we had a 20% growth in the first quarter in the U.S. in our sports medicine business. Travis Steed : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien of Piper Sandlers. Your line is open. Matthew O'Brien: Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned there is at least 6% growth in trauma and extremities, is that the growth of the overall market, because I know the E part of that is growing faster than the T part, is that the overall growth in that overall category combined? And then, as you think about going forward typically that nine to 18-month period is when you start to see the most dislocation from a product and a rep perspective is trauma and extremities different than what we see across traditional orthopedic acquisitions just because there's fewer places for some of these reps to go. So maybe the dislocation that you see could be a little less than we typically see? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I think the way things are playing out right now the dislocation is less than spine. Certainly, that's been our experience. It's been a pleasant surprise so far, and especially on the foot and ankle side where we had anticipated a bit more dislocation. And frankly, we have terrific products. And we provided really quick stability for our salespeople to know who their boss is, to know what their territory is. And so, we moved with more speed this time, learned some lessons from prior integrations. I would tell you that we think we're growing at least at the market, if not above the market, because you have to remember that at least 6% is for the full year, including a pretty depressed first quarter, right. So the first quarter of this year was not kind of a normal year as it relates to the extremities business at all. So to have that over the full year, at least 6% on a combined basis I think that's probably growing above the market and we'll see as the year progresses. Feeling very good about both our core trauma business and our extremities business. Matthew O'Brien: Got it, thanks for that. And then over to Neurovascular, I know you don't want to call off this acceleration during Q2 versus Q1, but that you're doing much better than the overall market by our calculations anyway, so are there specific areas that are accelerating? I don't know if it's ischemic specifically within that category, and that you're really well positioned there. And then just is your ability to bundle this much better than elsewhere? And I guess the real question is, can this business grow upper teens, low 20s for the next couple of years? Kevin Lobo : Well, it's been growing at that kind of rate for the last few years and this year, you are seeing an acceleration of growth. And what I would attribute it to is we already have fabulous coils, stent retrievers, we're already very, very good. But we've strengthened our portfolio with the flow diverting stent with the surpass of all stent, and with the 0.074, vector catheter, aspiration catheter, so that that for us was a product gap. We didn't have an easy to deploy, empty catheter approach for float diverting stent, and we didn't have a large for aspiration catheter. So we plugged those, let's call them product gaps. And we've had fantastic expansion around the world. And really, the Atlas stent in China, as an adjunctive stent for hemorrhagic is performing exceptionally well and this global business is really, really well run. We have an exceptional leadership team over there that have been executing very well, but I would say the acceleration; let's call it this year's acceleration versus prior years is really driven by this product cycle that really has us covering all of the bases with excellent products that are meeting the needs of our customers. Matthew O'Brien: Understood, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Richard Newitter : Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, you mentioned several times that how impressed you\u2019re with Wright Medical now that you've kind of had it under your operating belt for a few quarters now. I\u2019m just curious, is there other than just, the integration going better than planned, is there anything specifically either in the pipeline or embedded in that comment? It just, really, is surprising you to the upside or making you more excited about the future? You mentioned BLUEPRINT a few times, is something with BLUEPRINT. Just I'm curious if there's something that you're foreshadowing there, or physician general execution comment? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, so it was, we knew they had a good business. And we knew that their culture was similar to Strykers. But there's been some pleasant surprises along the way. Their talent is really excellent. And a lot of times when we buy companies, we buy them for their products. But then we have to infuse a lot of our management. They are a leader for upper extremities. They are a leader for lower extremities, are leading our businesses. Our head of knees came from Wright Medical. And so we've had an infusion of talent that for me has been a positive surprise. I mean, really outstanding leaders, their sales leader for upper extremities is outstanding and so that's been one positive. The second I would say is their key opinion leaders. They absolutely work with fabulous key opinion leaders on both upper and lower extremities. And I would say that they are better key opinion leaders than we had within Stryker. And so those are two really, to me pleasant surprises. And just the pipelines, we thought they were good, they turned out to be a little better than we thought and that really applies across the board. So there are certain things that you know, when you do a public deal, you don't get to do the same amount of due diligence as you do with a private acquisition. And so those instincts, we had instincts that things were going to be good, they are proving to be even better than we first thought. Richard Newitter : That's helpful call. Thanks. And then maybe just second question, conformance and the initiative that you have there. I appreciate the ASC help that product can potentially offer the solution there and the benefits there. Just wondering where else the conformance solution could go? And thinking kind of with an eye towards robotics and digital surgery as well, so we'll be thinking about, that being more meaningful going forward in other capacities outside of just ASC adoption. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, our primary focus was on the ASC, but there are a lot of hospitals that are concerned about sterilization and sterilization being sort of a constraint. And they'd like the less trays, they'd like less instrumentation they'd like less space taken up in their stockroom. So, I wouldn't say it's limited to the ASC's, but that really is out of the gates, let's say for the first six to nine months, that's our prime focus is going to be on the ASC because of their constraints on sterilization are the most acute, but I would say that there probably will be interest beyond that. But let's see that'll be more of a next year kind of commentary that I'd be able to get. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen. You may proceed. Joshua Jennings : I was hoping to just follow up on some of the commentary on the spine business. And can you just review your outlook on the value proposition, the current robots out in the market and maybe help us better understand the enabling technologies under Stryker\u2019s rule had done, don't get a lot of airtime? And how you believe Stryker\u2019s spine franchise can be competitive and in front of the Mako spine launch? Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. Listen, we are big believers in enabling technologies. We obviously have that with Mako. We did the Mobius acquisition and we're very excited about the imaging aspect of that. We do have a gap in spine robotics and we do believe that the first foray, the two competitive systems on the market today are really - are really good guidance systems for the placement of pedicle screws, and but it's providing value to surgeons, and we definitely want to have something like that on the market, which was what Mobius was working on. And then beyond that, we think with Mako, we could get into other procedures and other applications. But robotics is difficult, so it's going to take time for us to develop those applications and we'll keep you posted. But we do, we are big believers in enabling technology and we're going to continue to invest in that space. Joshua Jennings : Thanks for that. Maybe one follow up may be for you and Glenn. Just as you're moving towards the anniversary of the Wright acquisition, and hopefully we're all moving towards more normalcy in 2022. We've had an operating margin expansion kind of in the range of 30 to 50 basis points and how should investors be thinking about these cost range programs have been played for the last couple years? And the amount of P&L leverage that Stryker can experience in future? Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, sure. I think first of all, as a baseline if you think about a normal operating margin that was acquired through Wright Medical was, it was significantly less than say Stryker's normal operating margin. So if you think what have we worked on during this integration period, it was really pulling Wright Medical up and trying to look for all the synergies that we had built into our model, so that we could drive better operating margins at Wright Medical. I think fast forwarding into next year and looking at where that might look on a combined basis, I think we'll get back to our normalized, up margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. But at this point, that's a little ways away, and we're not really necessarily guiding for 2022. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Kyle Rose : Great, thank you very much for taking the questions. So a lot been asked, but we do have the ALS coming up in a few months here. And I wonder if you could just touch on maybe what some of the focuses that investors will see at the conference. I mean, I think about what's happened over the course of the last 12 months, you have acquired ortho sensor, you did touch on a little bit of the knee in a box and ASP knee opportunity there and then obviously robotics is getting a lot of attention in the ASPs in the outpatient setting. So maybe just that will set us on expectations into the conference? Kevin Lobo : Yes, listen, we don't have a big reveal at this conference. As you say we'll talk about the conformance product and we can talk about Triathlon AS-I, we have Mako, which is still going to be talked about quite a bit, especially with the new hip application that's starting to gain some steam, but still takes time to get that socialized more broadly. In addition to that, we have recent approval of the in space balloon for large rotator cuff repair within our sports medicine business, which is a very exciting product and a product used by sports medicine surgeons as well as the surgeons that do shoulder arthroplasty that come from Wright Medical. So that's also an exciting product, so as well as to perform Humeral product that Glenn mentioned earlier on with Wright Medical. So a number of new products, but it's really, frankly, an exciting time to get back with our customers at scale, not having that conference last year was certainly a gap and really look forward to engaging with our customers once again. And so that's really what we're going to be showing. It's not something brand new that we're going to be unveiling, but really more of just continuing the momentum that we already have. Kyle Rose : Great. And then the second question is, I think earlier, you noted that, when physicians do move procedures to the outpatient or the ASP they're typically using their, standard instrumentation sets or the same implant systems that use in the hospital, have you seen any changes in pricing or types of contracting that you're seeing, when your ASC team does go out to engage on driving initiatives there? Kevin Lobo : No, thus far, we're not seeing really any change in implant pricing. But we, what we are seeing is because of the capital requirement; we are seeing deals that involve multiple businesses of Stryker. We're seeing much more of that than we see in the hospitals. So the deals that we do typically involve four or five different businesses, and Stryker, whereas hospitals tend to buy product category by product category, but no real change on pricing. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor of UBS. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, great. This is actually [indiscernible] for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just one question, just on smoke evacuation, you mentioned it for several quarters now. It would be great if you can talk a little bit about the drivers for growth in recent quarters and the sustainability of growth going forward. Especially on the other side of COVID? That's a fair question. Kevin Lobo : Yes, absolutely. So we're very pleased with smoke evacuation and what that business does for us, in terms of our ability to grow. As we look at it, we really look at ourselves as market leaders behind our broad portfolio, and it's one of those businesses that actually sits across a couple of different divisions, both within instruments and also within endo, our endo businesses. In terms of what our expectations are, I mean, we're really going to continue to expand that market continues to expand both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. really driven by legislation, and really the desire around a safer operating room behind smoke free operating rooms. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next call comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird. You may proceed. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I'll be quick. Just one, Kevin, I'd be interested, it's always tough as an early reporter for you guys to know market share shifts and things like that. And the volatile numbers we're getting from everybody, these next couple quarters will be even tougher, just wondering kind of momentum wise that you're seeing with surgeons, in your core ortho business, can you talk to hip, knees, trauma, spine, any of those four areas where you've seen maybe a change at all good or bad in momentum, you think of pooling surgeons in on a competitive front? That'd be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, listen, it feels good to be sort of getting back to normal. It isn't totally normal. There are these pockets of disruption. But I would say that surgeons are starting to fill up their schedules, they're taking meetings with us, they're coming to trainings. And so we feel like we're sort of almost getting back to the kind of rhythm we had before, you can see it in our guidance. I mean it is a pretty bullish guide, to say we're going to do 9% to 10%, organic, plus strong performance out of Wright Medical, which was an integration and pretty complex, involving the trauma extremities, as well as our joint replacement business, because those businesses used to be under common sales management, and we've pulled those out. And so to be able to do all that and have this kind of wind at our back is pretty exciting and I would say customers are ready to engage ALS. I think it will be a pretty big conference, and based on what I'm hearing, it will be fairly well attended. And I think those are great opportunities for us to be able to show the power of Stryker and what we can offer to our customers. Jeffrey Johnson : Anything in those four core areas of orthopedics that where you're seeing kind of a change in your competitive positioning where just over the last three to six months or so, you may be feeling a little bit better or worse about your positioning and bringing in competitive accounts? Kevin Lobo : I would say more of the same. If you look at that knee number, that's a pretty good knee number and that has been the killer application with Mako and Mako was very, very strong, as you saw through the pandemic. And I think that will continue to be probably the one business that stands out. I mean, obviously upper extremities is going to continue to be a very, very strong performer. But I would say that's the one that probably we're feeling continued bullishness, if you will, but there's not been really I mean any other new dynamics just in the last quarter. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes, thanks. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Matti, and I'll be your operator for today's call [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, during the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter. While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular. International organic growth of 12%, again, outpaced growth in the US, representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as health care staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery. Our adjusted EPS grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. The EPS growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities. While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business. During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed. The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019. COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards towards the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September. At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October. However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility. Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter. Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses. The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients. Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. The teams have also developed long term product pipeline strategy. Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year. Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. Compared to 2019, the two year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double digit growth in both segments. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant. The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses. For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Our third quarter EPS was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US, reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures. Our US trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. Other ortho grew 19.8% in the US, primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Writer Medical delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis. In the US, comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double digital growth in our upper extremities business. In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%, ,which included 12% US organic growth as well. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products and strong double digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses. The Medical division had US organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. This growth reflects double digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment. Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps and Bone Mill. Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of US, non-US income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range. Based on our performance in the first nine months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15. And now I will open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Maybe to start on guidance. It sounds like October is off to a slower start. Maybe just if you could walk us through the different business lines and how you're seeing them throughout fourth quarter so far, and what gives you confidence that you could start to see a pickup? Do you have -- are orders increasing, are doctors increasing bookings? Just help us understand what gives you confidence for the tick-up? Preston Wells : So in terms of Q4, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw October starting to show some improvement as it relates to our implant related businesses. And so we are seeing a bit of a pickup, but I think it's important to note that it's starting from a lower starting point. So while we do expect there to be some recovery happening in those implant businesses throughout the quarter, we do expect it to get back to more normal levels by the end. There are a few headwinds that are out there as well in terms of not only additional COVID hotspots or things like that, but also with staffing being a potential headwind as well. So we're definitely monitoring those as we go. But we are seeing some improvement early in October versus where we ended in Q3. As it relates to the other parts of the business, as both Kevin, Glenn and myself mentioned, our capital business continues to perform very well, and we still have high expectations that those are going to continue into Q4, really and the way we look at that is just continuing to look at the order book as we ended the quarter and how that continues to progress in terms of growth. Same thing as we think about those more emergent businesses, whether it's trauma or neurovascular, again, those businesses are continuing to perform very well, and there's no reason to believe that they're going to slow down we think about Q4. So hopefully, that helps for you. Robbie Marcus : And maybe one more just to dive in a little deeper on the Trauma & Extremities. You talked about double digit growth within shoulder, but that was probably the biggest miss of any business versus The Street. So I was hoping you could give a little more detail there, was lower really slow? It doesn't sound like it's anything from the integration. So just hoping to get more color. Preston Wells : No, I think it's important to understand that on those parts of the business like extremities, like shoulder, like foot and ankle, they are subject to some of the elective procedure slowdown as well. So while they did see some of that impact, we're still really happy with how they performed. I mean they really are still growing. The integration is going well. And as I mentioned, in terms of the international piece, there's a little bit slower pickup there on some of the international businesses as we go through the transition and integration in those parts of the business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic. Matt Miksic : So I had maybe first thing, I guess, I would say is at this point, I don't think your comments on COVID related pressure and staffing challenges will come as much of a surprise to many folks who were sort of tracking this into the print and looking into Q4. But I did have a couple of questions on some aspects of your business. One, sort of COVID related and sort of related to one of your sort of strategic initiatives around ASCs. If you could talk maybe a little bit about the activity that you're seeing there, what kinds of changes you made to your organization, what kinds of shifts in volumes you've seen and how you think that may affect sort of the intermediate term for those businesses? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : We're continuing to see a shift to the ASC. The challenge we have right now is just the pace. So the capacity takes time to build, and every hospital system is in the process of trying to increase their capacity. So it is improving. And certainly, that will be a trend that had started prior to the pandemic and is continuing. We feel very good about our position in the ASC. It's way ahead of our expectations, frankly, going into the pandemic. One measure that we look at is our Sports Medicine business, and that performed in the United States was north of 20% growth in Q3. So we're seeing strength, but the challenge on the hip and knee side of it is just time to build capacity. So it's growing but it's going to just take time before it becomes a really, really meaningful part of our business. But we believe we're extremely well positioned both with Mako and even without Mako, with our portfolio of everything that they need for an ASC. Matt Miksic : And then my follow-up is just on maybe trying to look past the pressure that I think many folks are reporting this earnings cycle similar to what you're describing and into sort of next year, and I'm not sort of about to try to provide guidance out of you or anything like that for 2022. But one of the things that we hear often from your businesses and across the board is this sort of demand for capital equipment and if we look at challenges and procedures and staffing issues. And then on the other hand, hospitals, apparently investing fairly heavily in their capital equipment and infrastructure around robotic surgery, et cetera. And I just would love to hear your thoughts on if you see a relationship that\u2019s seen in the past relationship between capital and your procedural businesses and what that sort of tells you about the next 12 to 18 months on the back of this demand? Preston Wells : Well, I think the capital strength has really given the liquidity of hospitals. So hospitals, even though they're struggling through the pandemic, their liquidity is very good, partially due to the CARES funding that was put in place. They're in strong position and they are getting ready for the future. As we talked about on the last question about ASCs and construction of ASCs and investments in hospitals, the demand for technology is very strong. Our order book for capital is very strong. And there in fact, in Q3, there was actually even some slight delays of some of the capital. There were some challenges of actually having staff to receive some of the capital equipment and put it in place. But I would say I'm feeling very bullish and that capital cycle should continue speaking in the United States through all of next year. As it relates to the deferrable procedures, hips, knees, spine, those represent for Stryker a little less than 30% of our sales. And those are the ones that are most impacted. They will come back. And frankly, I'm excited about certainly hip and knee where the Mako volume continues to grow. And when those procedures come back, we're in a terrific position to capitalize on those because the Mako procedures we're putting in, roughly half of those are going into competitive accounts. And so when volumes come back, we will be able to really take advantage of that, not just in our own Stryker friendly accounts, but even in competitive accounts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : A couple on just attempting to quantify the backlog specifically in OrthoRecon heading into 2022 as we navigate the current Delta spike and maybe extending that to capital? Are you actually seeing some level of pent-up demand for Mako? And maybe just to sneak a quick one in there. Maybe just some high-level comments on supply chain pressures that we're hearing across obviously, this space and others. Is that a potential headwind to the capital business specifically as we head into 2022? Preston Wells : So let me see if I can address those different parts. So in terms of the backlog itself, and so just starting with the implant related backlog. I mean, obviously, the last 18 months has not been normal from a volume perspective. And so while we've had some good quarters and some slower quarters, that backlog has continued to exist. And in some cases, like this quarter, it's continued to build. And so it's hard to say exactly what it is because there's just so much variability that's happening across different regions. So if we look at this past quarter, obviously, the US was more impacted than other areas. But it's safe to say that the backlog still exists. And as we think about what's going to happen with that, we think that over time, as we get back to more normal levels, that backlog will begin to work down. And so you'll see some improvement in terms of growth rates over time that will be sustained. You won't really see a big large outsized growth rate that will happen in any one particular quarter with regards to the backlog. As we think about capital, I mean, there are areas for sure that there's been some pent-up demand and some of the uncertainty has just existed out there in terms of some of the hospital systems. But we're still seeing very strong demand for our products, like we talked about before. The order book remains really, really strong and it continues to grow as well as sales. So we feel very bullish, as Kevin said, with regards to how we think about capital as we go forward into 2022. With regards to the impacts from a raw material or supply chain perspective what I would tell you is there certainly are challenges just like everybody else has with regards to whether it's the tight labor market or shortages in things like electronics or resins. But as of now, we've been able to really effectively meet all of our customer needs. And so what that really has required is that our supply chain has really had to be much more active and its support in its partnership with the various supplier base that we have. And so we've been able to really make sure that we're maintaining our safety stock levels. We're really able to actively purchase critical components where necessary so that we can keep production going. And then also just around the logistics and distribution as well and working actively with those partners, all of that in anticipation of the fact that we think that there's going to continue to be some headwinds in this area. And so as a result, we have seen some increased costs as well in terms of inflation on those items. But to date, our supply chain and procurement teams have really just been able to manage that. And so we haven't seen anything really show up in terms of any major impacts on our financials. And so while we expect that to continue into the rest of '21 and into 2022 as well, we want to make sure that whatever we have in our numbers has already been factored in some of those raw material challenges that we have. And we're going to just continue to monitor the situation as it progresses. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Young Lee : This is Young Lee in for Matt. I guess I was wondering if you can share a little bit more color on the strength you're seeing in Mako, both in the US and OUS. How do you think it's positioned relative to the competition now that there's more entrants in the space? And can you also touch upon the Mako shoulder program? What should we expect in terms of the target that you are looking at, and any updates on time lines? Preston Wells : So the Mako business momentum continues and it's been strong throughout the pandemic. So in spite of the procedural slowdowns, we're seeing strong demand for our system. We clearly have the leading system on the market with a big head start versus the competition. And frankly, the competition is actually raised the water level of robotics and raised the importance of robotics. So we love our position. And we believe that it's just going to increase the demand for Mako. More and more systems are ordering their second and third and fourth Mako. So we know we have a winning solution for customers. We're very excited, frankly, with our hip software and our new hip application, which is now penetrated in all of our Mako accounts, and we're seeing a nice uptick. Even though the overall volumes are down because of COVID, we are seeing a nice uptick in the hip adoption given the new software, which makes it easier to do the procedure. So we feel like we're in a very good position. And the fact that there's more competitors to the space just validates the importance of orthopedics, and we like our chances. As it relates to the shoulder program, we do have an active program. We're not in a position right now to talk about time lines or dates for that. But as you saw with our results in Q3, our shoulder business is doing very well even before we have a solution with Mako. Young Lee : I guess maybe to follow up, I was wondering if you can talk about the M&A landscape. How actively are you looking at deals? What do you think about current valuations right now? Preston Wells : We are always actively looking at deals at Stryker. Even after the Wright Medical deal, as you saw, we've done a couple of smaller deals with Orthosensor and Gauss Surgical. Because of the debt that we've had to pay down, we've been focused more on tuck-ins. But I'm really delighted with the cash flow performance that we've had, both last year as well as the first nine months of this year. So now we can start to look at, let's say, slightly larger tuck-ins while we continue to pay down the debt. Valuations are very high overall, but there's still a lot of targets. And we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to run our M&A and offense and find value-creating acquisitions for sure, for Stryker. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Drew Stafford : This is Drew on for Matt. I just was wondering if you could talk about Mako in China and Japan. You said kind of bring spot in some areas and a mixed bag in others for a handful of companies that have reported so far. So just wondering how you would characterize that rollout in each of those geographies? Preston Wells : So I would just say that in terms of Mako as we think about outside the United States, we're really pleased with how that's progressing, and we're seeing good growth really in all markets outside the US. As we think about Japan, for example, we know that the business continues to progress well and the number of installs in Japan is increasing month-over-month. So we're really happy with how the technology has been received and the feedback that we're getting, and the number of procedures that are being done on Mako and Japan continue to increase as well. As far as China is concerned, it's much earlier days in China from a Mako standpoint, but the momentum is really building there. We're still working through the impacts of the volume based procurement activity. But we do expect Mako to be a key technology and play a key role for us as we think about our rebound business in China going forward. Drew Stafford : And then just a quick follow-up here on the Neurovascular side. The performance has been really, really strong in the last couple of quarters. So maybe you can kind of give us a sense for what you think the market growth rate looks like there? And then just a sense of what's driving your portfolio of products to really take share compared to quarters in the past. Preston Wells : So in terms of Neurovascular, obviously, it's a very hot market. But also when you look at our results with regards to that market, you're seeing a couple of things happen. You're seeing really impact of the technologies that we've been able to introduce over the past probably 12 to 18 months and taking advantage of really a product super cycle really from our neurovascular team where we're expanding into some different areas and then also, we're seeing the market expand. So if you think about places like China, for example, we're seeing market expansion happen there. So our results are really a result of both of those items. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Maybe one on the big picture and one on the finance side. Starting with the big picture. Kevin, it seems like there's a tale of two cities in device. And some of your peers have assumed Q4 sort of normalizing on the procedure side. Other companies certainly have called out Q4 being in line with 3Q levels and things worsening, or perhaps being similar to September trends. Is this more regional, is this a basinal impact, or is this an ortho versus other parts of the life science? Maybe just put things into perspective on why we're seeing a divergence and what are you assuming for the Q4 recovery? Kevin Lobo : As Preston mentioned, Q4, we're assuming a similar growth rate as we saw in Q3, so versus 2019 we're expecting similar kind of growth rate. Obviously, sequentially, we'll have an improvement because Q4 is a larger quarter than Q3. But year-over-year, we're expecting a similar growth rate. Related to that question, I would say that it's really ortho and spine related that's the bigger factor. So we have products that are used in general surgery and our Endoscopy division and smoke evacuation, and we're not seeing the same kind of fall off in those areas as we're seeing in hips and spine. So I do believe it's mostly procedure related, which creates the difference that you're describing between us and some of the other med tech companies. There's also regional. Stryker, of course, has a very strong presence in the United States. And so that regional impact -- you even saw that with our own implant businesses that we had a more negative impact in the United States than we did in international. And so that's the secondary factor. But I would say the primary factor for what you're seeing versus other companies is that these procedures, hip, knee and spine are more deferrable than some of the other procedures in some of our other med tech peers. Vijay Kumar : And one on finance, Glenn, free cash conversion year-to-date, we're running pretty close to 90%. Has something changed here? I know people used to ask on free cash conversion, but just really an execution here despite some choppiness on the pandemic side, the margin execution, free cash execution here seems to be stellar. So I'm curious, has anything changed for you guys on the free cash side? Glenn Boehnlein : Vijay, you're right, free cash flow of almost $2.1 billion year-to-date, an 87% conversion ratio, a lot of it has to do with several factors. We've been sort of priming the organization to really start focusing and delivering on cash flow. I think as we entered into COVID, it was a real alarm bell for, hey, let's really start focusing on this so that we can sort of keep active in M&A. We can pay down debt, we can meet a lot of the sort of goals that we wanted to meet. So I think we're feeling a little bit of that. You look at performance on AR, we've started to move a lot of our AR into shared service centers and so we're getting better on process. If you look at AP, we have a large initiative that's being driven by our GQO organization in terms of working with vendors and being smart about what our AP terms can be and should be. And then all of our divisions are very focused on inventory management and just being smarter about what are the safety stock levels that you really need and what don't you need, and how can we make sure that we're having the right inventory at the right time when we need it. And then I think the other thing that we're feeling a little bit is we have been fairly controlled and prudent as we look at allocating dollars to capital expenditures. And as you look at our Wright Medical integration, we've really been focused on that spend as well and are running probably a little ahead of where our goals were on that. So I really do think that it's a muscle that the organization has really learned and has grown over the past two years and it's something that I feel pretty strongly about we'll be able to continue from here on out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Josh Jennings : Just a question on staffing shortages and maybe a little bit granular, but just thinking about the different settings of care and staff shortages in hospitals, I think it's clear, but just wondering about ASCs. Is there a different dynamic in play at ASCs? And if the staffing shortage headwind persist into 2022, do you think we can see even stronger migration trends of both surgeries into the ASPs, particularly in ortho? Preston Wells : In terms of staffing shortages, I mean we're seeing it really holistically. I mean, I think it certainly is playing itself out more so in the hospital setting because obviously, there's a lot more fatigue that's been there, there's COVID that still exists in the hospital setting. So I think that it certainly is playing out a bit more in the hospital setting, and we haven't -- we've still seen our procedural volumes in the ASP continue to go and certainly have not been as impacted as those in the hospital. How that continues and how that impacts the shift, I think, is still really anybody's guess. I mean we certainly will continue to expect to see products and procedures shifting to the ASC anyway because that trend that's already started and certainly accelerated over the last 18 months. So I think that's going to continue to happen. The staffing shortage is something that I think we're going to live with for a little bit as well. And so we'll continue to work through those challenges in the next year also. Josh Jennings : I want to just have a follow-up on Red. I know you reiterated multiple time on this call, just integration is progressing nicely and you're optimistic about the combined businesses in Trauma & Extremities. But you've had to work through some dis-synergies associated with the integration of the pandemic headwinds at November close is coming up. But as we get into normalized period, should we be thinking about the Trauma business as accretive to corporate wide organic revenue growth as that integration is first year is complete and hopefully, we get into normalized grades in 2022? Kevin Lobo : I would say that I'm absolutely bullish about the Wright medical integration. It's been fantastic in the United States. As Preston mentioned, we still have work to do outside the United States. The timing is a little bit later with some of the conversions of our distributors. And so we're still working through with OUS. But in the US, very bullish about core trauma, upper extremities and lower. Now lower, of course, has been impacted somewhat by the deferral of procedures because they're more elective, a lot of the foot and ankle procedures. But love the leadership team that we have in place, love the pipeline that we have in place and really believe that the entire business of trauma extremities will be accretive to overall Stryker. As you know, Extremities is probably the fastest growing space within Orthopaedics. And we have a fantastic portfolio, a combined portfolio in both upper and lower extremities. But I think one of the side benefits of the Wright Medical integration has been for us to also have a dedicated business just on trauma. So three dedicated businesses, three terrific leaders of all businesses and great leadership teams. And so we're seeing that, frankly, as you saw with the US number on a combined basis being over 8% is really a terrific performance in spite of a slowdown in the foot and ankle space, the overall business is performing very well. And I do expect in '22 and beyond that it will be accretive to Stryker's overall growth rate. Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Two for me. One, you have an analyst meeting coming up in a few weeks. Could you guys give us a preview of what to expect, are you going to give us long-term financial goals? And I have one follow-up. Preston Wells : We're really going to really talk about all the growth drivers that make Stryker special. As we think about emerging from the pandemic and all the different things that are going to help our business continue to grow into the future for sure. The long term financial goals will definitely be part of that. Larry Biegelsen : And I know you're not going to talk specific guidance about next year. But Kevin or Glenn, how are you feeling about continuing to deliver top tier revenue growth and the 30 to 50 basis points of leverage that you guys target? How are you feeling about that with the inflation headwinds that we're all paying close attention to? Preston Wells : On the first question, as you've seen over the last nine years and fully expect into the future that we will have organic sales growth at the high end of med tech. Clearly, COVID has put a crimp on that in hips, knees and spine. But other than that, you're seeing that in all of the rest of our businesses. And as the recovery happens, you should fully expect that we'll continue to be a top tier grower. As it relates to margins, Glenn, do you want to? Glenn Boehnlein : As I look at op margin, first off, I even just look at this quarter and given the impact of COVID, given the dilution from Wright Medical, I mean we're pretty happy that our op margin is pretty much flat with 2019. So that's a good performance. We did not contemplate the impacts we're feeling from COVID in op margin guidance. And so we'll talk about more at the analyst meeting sort of what we think that means. But what I will tell you is we have every intention to drive that goal once we exit the impacts of COVID. So the organization will not back away from that. And even during COVID, we're very mindful of our discipline around spending and how important that is. So we'll expect to see some increases in spending probably in Q4 and those will set us up to grow in 2022. So we really will allow sort of spending around some of those sales force hiring and marketing initiatives to occur. But as far as it relates to 30 to 50 basis points beyond what we feel in COVID, we will not back away from that goal. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : This is David on for Steve. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about what you're seeing currently in terms of the China tenders and volume based procurement and what are your expectations for the impact of that next year? Preston Wells : So I guess, first of all, when we start thinking about our business and we think about China and we think about the products and services that are impacted by the volume based tendering, if we think about JR, trauma and spine, those sales really are that are exposed to the tendering process are less than 1% of the total Stryker revenue. So it's a very small overall impact as we think about for Stryker. But I guess, just focusing on the tender itself, in mid-September, as everybody knows, the bidding was done for the national tender around joint replacements. Our bids were certainly competitive and we secured a position for both hips and knees for our business. Overall, as everybody also knows about 80% price reduction from the end market sale is going to be taking place across the entire industry. And so certainly, that has an impact on us as we think about going forward, but there's a lot of work still left to be done in terms of how that's going to actually be executed. So we're staying vigilant with the teams in China to try to understand how that's going to roll out. It's expected to roll out, I think, in the first quarter of next year. And so it will remain dynamic until we really understand how it's going to execute. In terms of '22, we're not giving guidance at this point in time and it will certainly be factored in as we give guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. Unidentified Analyst : Just one follow-up. What are your latest thoughts on the smart implants? And what's your outlook for this market now having OrthoSensor under your umbrella for several quarters? Preston Wells : So with smart implants, I mean, like we've said in the past, we think that there's a role that smart implants are going to play with regards to orthopedics going forward. But there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of understanding how that's going to be integrated from an implant and then understanding how that's going to play out from a monitoring standpoint going forward. So I would say it's still early in the process. We're happy to have OrthoSensor under the Stryker name and certainly the expertise that they bring in the sensor technology. And so looking forward to updating you as we develop more around that product in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : So I just want to ask specifically based on the organic growth guidance of 7% to 8% versus \u201819 and kind of where consensus is landing. Obviously, there's a delta there. And you've already -- it's clear, obviously, around the elective areas in terms of the impact in the fourth quarter and kind of what you're guiding to. I guess I'm just curious, Kevin or Preston, is there anything to call out, particularly within the MedSurg areas from a headwind standpoint that you'd caution us about? Just because the delta versus The Street is somewhat meaningful as we think about our models. And so I just want to make sure that we're not skipping over any impact that you could be -- have us contemplate within that? Kevin Lobo : Just to reiterate what I said in my opening comments. We expect very high performance for MedSurg and Neurotechnology. So we expect them to perform very similarly. It may not be -- some puts and takes between the businesses a little bit. But overall, you should expect similar growth out of MedSurg and Neurotechnology in Q4, as you saw in Q3. So the delta versus The Street is clearly in the hip, knee and spine area. That's the area that's had the biggest impact from COVID. And what we're calling in our guidance is for a similar quarter in Q4 as Q3. Now obviously, we don't have a lot of visibility. It's an uncertain environment. Hopefully, the recovery will be better than what we're calling, but that's the visibility that we have thus far. And as you saw that this quarter surprised us Q3 and we're being cautious as we give our guidance for Q4. Ryan Zimmerman : And then just a follow-up. You have a new hip stem coming out. You've got the software now, I think, on the entire fleet of Mako. And so I'd love to understand just kind of your expectation on what [Technical Difficulty] for you, particularly within direct interiors that J&J has been so dominant in for some time? Kevin Lobo : We're really excited about the new STEM. The procedures are being launched this quarter -- early launch, I'd call it, this quarter. And we're building up towards a full launch of the hip stem at the AAOS meeting, which is towards the end of the first quarter. So it will be a bit of a slow build but we're really excited, and that stem we will marry that stem up with Mako. So that's one of the things we still have to do that. But I would say you'll start to see pretty meaningful impact probably by the end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, you'll start to see meaningful impact. But this is a product gap that we've had for some time. Very excited about the position that we're in. We're building the product right now. Surgeons who have seen the product are very excited about it. So we do believe it's what we've needed frankly, within our hip portfolio. And you'll start to see that again. You won't see a lot -- you won't see anything really in the fourth quarter, and you won't see much in the first quarter, but it will start to have an impact in the second quarter and definitely in the back half of next year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. And we hope that you can all join us in person on November 18th for our 2021 Analyst Meeting and product fair with our broader leadership team. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter and our annual Mako update. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. As a reminder, as announced during our Analyst Day in November, we have reclassified our reporting segments into two groups : MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This better aligns to how our businesses are managed internally. We have also pulled out Neurovascular on its own line and have the business units of neurosurgical instruments, CMF and ENT now grouped under Neurocranial. As we have done all year, we will comment on our performance versus 2019 which we believe is a better basis for comparison. For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 6% versus 2019, driven by double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses but offset by softer sales of our Hips, Knees and Spine as COVID and hospital staffing challenges had a meaningful impact on elective procedures during the quarter. We posted double-digit organic growth in international compared to 2019 as our globalization efforts continue to bear fruit and where COVID impacts were generally less severe than in the U.S. While our more deferrable businesses were challenged, we saw excellent results from our Mako robotic technology, capital products across our metric portfolio and continued double-digit organic growth in Neurovascular which reached approximately $1.2 billion in sales for the year. Despite the unanticipated Omicron variant, we were able to achieve full year sales growth and adjusted EPS within our latest guidance ranges. Our full year organic growth exceeded 7% and reflects strong demand for our Mako and MedSurg capital equipment and strong double-digit sales growth within Neurovascular and Neurocranial. In addition, we are very pleased with the Wright Medical integration, particularly in the U.S. Our full year adjusted EPS grew 10% versus 2019 and we delivered free cash flow conversion of 85%. The EPS growth was a strong result given the inflationary pressures that grew in the quarter and the COVID impact on our implant procedures. We continued to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 6.6% of sales for the year and our new product pipelines are poised for continued success. Our strong cash flow performance provided us with additional flexibility to execute on M&A opportunities in the quarter, including Thermedx, a small tuck-in within endoscopy and the recently announced agreement to acquire Vocera. Despite the impacts of the pandemic throughout the year, we were able to surpass $15 billion, $16 billion and $17 billion in revenue for the first time. And we remain confident in the outlook for our business as the pandemic recedes. We continue to execute on our key growth strategies, including the expansion of our ASC offense, continued product innovation and category leadership across our businesses. Turning to 2022; the volatility caused by COVID variants remains ongoing and is further impacted by hospital staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions. In spite of this, we expect to continue to deliver above-market sales growth. However, given the pressures on our supply chain within MedSurg, we do not expect to deliver our typical degree of earnings leverage. We continue to be disciplined with our spending. However, we will continue to fuel new products with healthy R&D spending and will maintain our focus on above-market growth while we work through these cost pressures. As noted in the press release, we are guiding to 6% to 8% full year organic sales growth and adjusted EPS of $9.60 to $10 per share. As I conclude my comments, I remain confident in our strategy, talent and culture. I would like to thank our teams for continuing to persevere in these challenging times. I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the latest impacts of COVID-19 across certain products during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on Mako and recent acquisitions, including the continued integration of Wright Medical and the performance of our combined Trauma and Extremities business. During the quarter, hospital bed and operating room capacities were challenged because of the Delta variant early in the quarter and most recently by the Omicron variant which started to pressure elective procedural volumes in December. In addition, ongoing nursing staffing shortages disrupted hospital scheduling of procedural volumes. The delay in procedural volumes primarily impacted our implant-related businesses, including hips knees, spine and foot and ankle which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. However, we know that most of these patients will eventually return to have those procedures completed as the impacts from COVID decline and procedural volumes return to more normal levels. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter, including double-digit orders and sales which created a strong order book for capital products. Despite the strong capital demand, there were some headwinds in the quarter that primarily impacted our Medical business, including installation delays caused by hospital staffing challenges and raw material shortages primarily related to electronics that created some supply disruptions. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, our global Mako installed base grew by 27% and we now have an installed base that is approaching 1,500 Mako robots. This continues to grow -- this growth continues to highlight the high demand for our differentiated Mako robotic technology. The strong double-digit growth also underscores our ongoing success installing robots in major teaching institutions, ASCs and competitive accounts, as well as our focus on expanding into international markets. In the fourth quarter, we saw a meaningful increase in the percentage of robots installed into competitive accounts. Turning to U.S. knee procedures. In the fourth quarter, over 50% of our total knees were Mako knee procedures, a trend that continues to increase and demonstrates the outstanding utilization of the Mako install base. The shift towards cementless knees also continued. And in the fourth quarter, cementless knees made up 47% of our U.S. knee procedures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, over 25% of our total hip procedures were Mako Hip procedures which similar to knees, continues to increase in utilization. Our recently launched Insignia Hip Stem will also be Mako-capable by the end of the first quarter. We expect to further our leadership position in orthopedic robotic-assisted surgery through the continued adoption of our Mako SmartRobotics platform on a global basis. Shifting to our Trauma and Extremities business. We are now over one year into the integration of Wright Medical which continues to progress well in all regions and across all functions, despite the headwinds from COVID. Including Wright Medical, the combined U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew high single digits in 2021 which exceeded our expectations. The full year growth in the United States was driven by strong growth in core trauma and double-digit growth in the upper extremities business which offset the COVID-related impact on foot and ankle. This strong result reflects excellent execution of the sales integration and the strength of the product portfolio. Finally, our dedicated divisional business development teams continued to identify and execute on meaningful acquisitions. As Kevin mentioned, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Vocera and enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. We expect the Vocera acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, we also finalized the acquisition of Thermedx. Thermedx is an innovative developer and manufacturer of fluid management solutions and will allow our endoscopy business to improve surgical visualization across the women's health segment and advance the standard of care in the urology segment. We believe these and other acquisitions completed during the year will help us continue to drive above-market growth in the future. The overall environment remains uncertain as a result of the continuing COVID pandemic and we expect hospital staffing shortages, supply constraints and significant inflationary pressures caused by raw material shortages to persist throughout 2022. However, we believe that the underlying demand for our products remains strong and coupled with a robust order book for our capital products, gives us confidence in our ability to drive market-leading growth when the impacts of the pandemic subside. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Today's sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. And as with previous quarters this year, all comments are in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.7%. Versus Q4 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Foreign currency had a favorable 0.5% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 4.7%, reflecting the impact of COVID on elective procedures, hospital staffing shortages and disruptions of general hospital operations. This was offset partially by strong demand for Mako and our MedSurg and Neurotechnology products. International organic sales showed strong growth of 10.6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Canada and emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 7.2%, with U.S. organic growth of 5.2% and international organic growth of 12.9%. 2021 had the same number of selling days as 2019 and one less selling day compared to 2020. Compared to 2019, the two-year price impact had an unfavorable 1.5% impact on sales. Versus full year 2020, pricing was 0.8% unfavorable. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.71 increased to 8.8% from 2019, reflecting sales growth and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix, increased adverse COVID-related pressure on sales, gross margin inflationary pressures and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright Medical acquisition. Our full year EPS of $9.09 which represents growth of 10% from full year 2019 reflects the favorable impacts of sales growth, operating expense discipline, Wright Medical, foreign currency and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased investments in R&D as well as higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and NeuroTech had constant currency sales growth of 11.8%, with organic sales growth of 11.6% which included 9.3% of U.S. organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by strong growth in their Orthopaedics instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in their power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including general surgery and fluorescence products and strong double-digit growth of their sports medicine and communications businesses. The Medical division had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.3%, reflecting solid performances in their Sage and bed businesses. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders across the medical portfolio, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and a reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted organic growth of 7.4% reflecting solid growth in their hemorrhagic and aspiration products. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 5.7% which included solid growth in our MAC space, ENT navigation and cryotherapy products, somewhat offset by continued COVID impacts. Internationally, MedSurg and NeuroTech had organic sales growth of 18.6%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy, Medical, Neurovascular and Neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe Canada, China and in the NeuroTech businesses in emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.2% and an organic sales decline of 0.8% with an organic decline of 2% in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures during the quarter as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID. Our U.S. Knee business grew 0.1% organically. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2019, our U.S. Knee business had very strong growth of approximately 10.5%. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 6.7% on a comparable basis with strong growth in our plating products combined with double-digit growth in our upper extremities business. Spine declined 6.6% organically in the U.S., primarily resulting from COVID disruptions to their business. Other Orthopaedics grew 21.5% organically in the U.S., primarily reflecting continued strong demand for our Mako robotic platform which had growth in the U.S. of 43.5%. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 1.9% organically which reflects the strong momentum of Mako in Japan, Korea and emerging markets, somewhat offset by the impact of volume-based pricing in China, primarily related to our Trauson business. For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business which includes Wright Medical, delivered 4.1% constant currency growth on a comparable basis. The Wright Medical acquisition anniversaried in November 2021 and will be part of our organic sales throughout 2022. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.8%, was unfavorable approximately 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter in 2019, gross margin was adversely impacted by business mix; operational inefficiencies due to COVID, including employee absenteeism; and raw material inflation, primarily related to electronic components, steel and transportation costs. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 with a more pronounced impact in the first half of 2022. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales which represents an 80 basis points increase versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.1% of sales which was a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.3% of sales which is 100 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2019. This performance primarily resulted from adverse business mix, gross margin challenges, investments in R&D and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. Other income and expense increased as compared to fourth quarter in 2019, primarily resulting from the interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is 14.9% which was partially impacted favorably by onetime items during the year. For 2022, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.5 billion. For the year, we paid down $1.2 billion of debt. Turning to cash flow; our full year cash from operations was approximately $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management. For 2022, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $650 million. Again, in 2022, we do not plan to do any share buybacks given our anticipated focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide you 2022 full year guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will be continued volatility caused by ongoing COVID-related impacts, hospital staffing challenges and increasing supply chain disruptions as well as significant inflationary risks. Given this variability, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% for the full year 2022 when compared to 2021. There are the same number of selling days in 2022 compared to 2021. Consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in previous years, we would expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted as compared to 2021 and this is included in our guidance. Despite the top line and operational risks of COVID, we have good momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2022, including the continued demand for our Mako technology, a very robust order book for our capital products, continued execution of our combined T&E business and many, many product innovations. For the full year 2022, we do not expect to deliver our typical operating margin expansion as a result of the ongoing price escalation on supply-constrained raw materials like electronic components and rising inflationary costs on raw materials transportation and labor costs. As a result of the latest COVID wave and the current inflationary environment, we expect gross margin performance to be negatively impacted by 50 to 100 basis points with a more pronounced impact in the first half of the year. As we said during our analyst call in November, we plan to return to our normal delivery of margin expansion once we reach a post-COVID environment. Finally, for 2022, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10 for the full year. This wider guidance range represents the ongoing variability in the operating environment. The upper end of our guidance range assumes the latest COVID wave subsides in Q1, with no additional major COVID disruptions during the year. In addition, it assumes that the supply chain stabilizes by the end of the first half of the year. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued COVID-related volatility persists, including supply chain pressures that could impact revenues as well as costs and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain pressures. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie, your line is open. Robert Marcus : Thank you. And thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could start just following up on guidance. I think investors really -- I'd love to get a sense of cadence through the year. How are you thinking about maybe first quarter or first half relative to second half both on top and bottom line, so we can calibrate correctly. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. Yes, Robbie, I think right now -- and obviously, you kind of see it because of the wide range of guidance we've provided, both sort of top and bottom. But our thinking is, is that the real pronounced impact that we'll have on top line and on gross margin will be in the first half of the year. We'll really feel the impacts related to that very pronounced in first quarter and lesser so in second quarter. And then we feel like things will start to stabilize by the time we get to third quarter and fourth quarter. But we do see real cost pressures, especially around our electronic components which go in many, many of our products, especially on the MedSurg side of the business. And the buying of those products is many times in a spot market where it's an auction process and we're paying significantly higher prices than what we normally would pay related to those. Robert Marcus : Got it. Maybe I could just tag on to that. As we think about first quarter here, we've heard other companies more muted kind of flattish or low single-digit growth with the cadence improving over the back part of the year. Is that a reasonable assumption? And then I'll jump back in queue. Preston Wells : Yes. I mean, Robbie, we're not obviously guiding for the quarter. But certainly, as we think about the fourth quarter and how the fourth quarter ended with regards to the COVID variants continuing into January. So I think you can certainly think about it that way that there are some of those pressures from a top line standpoint that are certainly continuing at the beginning of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne, your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you and good evening. Two questions; the first one has to do with U.S. Mako robotic placements. If I heard that correctly, that's a big number. Should we interpret that as just general demand or maybe demand ahead of expectations for increasing procedures? Preston Wells : No. I think, Joanne, if the Mako numbers you're referring to are how we're continuing to utilize Mako as it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our total knee business, I mean this is just a continuation as we think about what we've talked about over the last few years. So again, we expect this to just continue to grow as we think about the utilization both on knees and what we're now seeing on hips as well and then also as we think about cementless in the knee world. So we would expect that just to continue to go as we continue to place and install Mako's in different areas. Joanne Wuensch : All right. And then it sounds also, if I'm hearing correctly, that this may be a year where you just sort of plow through and continue to invest, even if it's a little bit rocky. Is that the right way to think about things? Kevin Lobo : Yes, Joanne, this is Kevin. That's exactly the right way to think about it. We have terrific product pipelines. We have a lot of new products we're launching this year, including a new power cot, the Insignia Hip Stem, a number of foot and ankle launches, three launches in the upper extremities space. We have the in-space balloon. So a lot of new products but we're also gearing up for 2023, where we're planning to have a next-gen camera, a next-generation power tool, next-generation life pack. And as you know, these new products are really the lifeblood of our top line growth. So we are not going to slow down on the R&D investments. Of course, we'll look at the rest of our SG&A and be cautious just like you've seen us be cautious over the last two years. But yes, we are going to power through. But we do have a lot of tailwinds. We have a very strong order book and capital equipment. We're having a little trouble securing all the components to be able to ship all the products but we have a healthy order book. We have good momentum. And obviously, we need to ride out the COVID challenges. But yes, we are going to continue to invest for the future. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Have a great night. Operator : Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the question. One for Glenn on margins and one on Hips and Knees. So on margins, Glenn, just to clarify the negative 50 to 100 basis points of gross margin impact. Is that the gross impact from inflation hitting the P&L? Or is that the impact you expect the year-over-year change in the gross margin in '22 versus '21? And why are you confident the inflation will abate in the second half of the year and it won't linger? And I have one follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Larry, honestly, that's the year-over-year impact to gross margins, not the isolated necessarily inflationary impact. That would include impacts from pricing pressures as well. Confidence that it will abate, I don't necessarily think that I have confidence it will abate. I think it will moderate is what will happen. I mean a lot of this pricing pressure is based on commodity pricing which is highly driven by supply and demand. I do believe that supply will catch up. We are securing bulk purchases of demand. So I think that will help us even out our utilization of it as well. And so I do think by the back half of the year, we'll start to see moderation of those costs. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And Kevin, typically, Knees are more deferrable than Hips. This time, your Knee growth was much better than your Hip growth. That's -- I guess that's unusual. I don't know, I'm not looking at all the historicals but usually, we think about Hips being more -- less deferrable. So why do you think Knee growth was so much better than Hip growth this quarter for you guys? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : For us, Knees has been really the engine of growth within our joint replacement business, if you look over the last two, three years. The combination of Mako and cementless is just so powerful that we've had a disproportionate growth in Knees relative to the market. In Hips, we have a gap with that hip stem which really -- the new stem that we -- we're just in early launch right now, the full launch will be at Academy, a bit at the end of the first quarter. That's really going to solve a gap in the direct anterior procedure. So I do expect that our Hip business will pick up. You're right that technically it's a little less deferrable but the mix, it's really the product portfolio that we have now which has favored Knees. It's not new in this quarter. It's been going on for the last couple of years. And we do expect our Knee business to continue to thrive. And we're excited about the new hip stem, especially when it becomes compatible with Mako at the end of the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matt, your line is open. Matt Miksic : Hi, good evening. Thanks so much for taking our questions. So I had one for Glenn on sort of the margin trends and thoughts about sort of earnings growth over the -- this year and intermediate and then a follow-up for, maybe, Kevin, on ASCs. So Glenn, this year, just a couple of questions. You've talked about -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks, these issues of inflationary pressure hoping, I guess, by the end of the year that some of this is going to -- you're going to be able to manage through them a little bit better. But taking that in the context of your longer-term outlook that you've given at your Analyst Day, could you talk a little bit about sort of, I guess, reconciling this near-term outlook and expectations for earnings growth given the current environment versus what you had described over longer term which was sort of an open-ended long-term average EPS growth that obviously contemplates a different environment next year and the year after than we're facing at this moment. And then as I mentioned, just one follow-up for Kevin or -- on ASCs, if I could. Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Yes, Matt, I think, first of all, at the Analyst Day, the guidance that we laid out was our long-term financial guidance. That guidance was specifically once we exit this kind of COVID environment which clearly in 2022, we are not in a position that we're exiting the COVID environment. Right now, just based on foundationally what is underlying those long-term financial plans in terms of what we have lined up for growth, how do we think about M&A, how do we think about our product portfolio and new innovation, I see no reason why we would change our thoughts around that long-term growth. Now if you work your way down through the income statement and say, okay, how are you going to finagle your EPS to get to that growth challenge number. I actually think in this year's growth number, if you look at the high end of our EPS, we're not far away from what we're asserting is our long-term challenge. I do think that once COVID abates, we will get right back on our cost improvement initiatives, especially around direct purchasing. I don't see that changing at all. Throughout COVID, we have kept up pace in our CTG initiative still, just in terms of focusing on shared service opportunities, looking at indirect purchasing opportunities. And so all those foundational elements are still in place. And I do have all the confidence to think that once we exit COVID that we'll get right back into that cadence of delivering that. Matt Miksic : That's helpful. And then just on ASCs, also kind of a big part of the presentation at your Analyst Meeting and came up again today, I think, in your performance commentary for Q4. Would be great to get your perspective maybe on as we think about Orthopaedics and large joints in particular, moving into that channel over time, as folks have been talking about for a while, if you could give us any sense of what -- if and when you'll be able to give us some sense of your percentage of your businesses there, how the growth there differ, say, from growth in your sort of traditional larger centers. Is there any kind of color over and above what you gave just now on Q4? Would be super helpful. Preston Wells : Matt, it's Preston. So as we've talked about in the past, we talked about our Knees, in particular, being about 5% to 10% of our business being in the ASC. And as we've seen that continue to grow, as we came through the fourth quarter, we're seeing numbers that are actually reaching closer to that 10% number. So, we are seeing that shift happen. I mean it certainly is happening when we think about where patients are wanting to get procedures done. Certainly, as we think about our focus from our offense standpoint, as we think about the ASC, we are seeing the shift happen across our product line. So certainly, we expect that to continue to go. We've talked about that there is an opportunity for that to continue to grow over time. Certainly, there are capacity constraints as ASCs are built out that will allow that continue to grow faster. But that's a shift that was already started and we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. Kevin Lobo : And I'd just like to add that outside of large joints, we also have our sports medicine business. That's within endoscopy. It grew 30% in the fourth quarter. So that's a great sign of the overall success that Stryker is having in ASCs, that really terrific growth in our sports medicine business. Matt Miksic : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. As hospitals are filling with the labor pressures in 2022, it could impact hospital cash flows. So are you seeing hospitals take a pause with capital purchases until they understand how the cash flows will be impacted by these labor costs? I understand that the order book is quite strong. Just thinking about how you're going to refresh the order book. Preston Wells : Yes, Pito. No, we are not seeing that at all. I mean what we've continued to see throughout the pandemic and while some of it early on was aided by some of the CARES funding and things of that nature, we are seeing strong balance sheets and we're seeing the continued need for capital products. Certainly, as we think about the capital products that we supply that are either lending towards revenue generating for the hospital, or towards safety and outcome for the hospital. So we're definitely seeing a continued strength in terms of the capital demand, especially for our products. I mean our order book, as we'd said, is really strong heading into the year and there's a lot of confidence given some of the products that Kevin even outlined earlier that that's going to continue throughout the year. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. And then a follow-up questions. If gross margins are going to be impacted by 75 basis points at the midpoint, is it fair to think about some 40 basis points or so of SG&A leverage during the year in R&D flat? I just want to get a feeling for G&A versus the gross margins. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. As you think about operating expenses and I think Kevin emphasized this, we've protected R&D through this entire period. We just -- we know that's the lifeblood. We know we have to spend there. And so we have not backed away from funding those innovation initiatives from a people standpoint or a technology standpoint. And that's important and we won't change there. On the SG&A front, we've been a little more prudent. I think you've seen us be smart about our spending, be smart about, obviously, we're not traveling a lot, so we're not feeling that. I think as 2022 unfolds, though, I mean, a couple of things. Obviously, we'll continue to be prudent about hiring and bringing in costs but we will start to see those costs that relate to growth especially as it relates to interactions with customers, hiring sales forces, expanding territories, those types of costs will expand specifically in selling. Now that being said, we will continue to pressure G&A, corporate type spending and things like that to try to offset some of that. But that's kind of how those operating expenses will look throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Pinal from Jefferies. Frank, please go ahead. Frank Pinal : Hi guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me on Mako, clearly, a strong quarter. You're now at 1,500 installs market lead. I'm just wondering at this point, Mako's been on the market for 7 years. And given the level of success and I think you're sort of seeing above 50% Mako procedures on Knees, above 25% on Hips. Where does that go? Does that go to 80% on Knees? Does that go to 50% on Hips over the next 5 years? And has your thinking on that opportunity at all changed U.S./OUS. Kevin Lobo : Yes, this is really great to see; the growth in robotics. It's obviously creating a new standard of care. It's becoming expected. Residents are expecting this as they enter the workforce in orthopedics. And so we see the growth absolutely continuing. It's going to continue along the path that's been going on. I think we're going to see Hips potentially hit an inflection point with our -- with the launch of our new stem and start to really accelerate. So, we're very excited about the future. We think robotics is here to stay as you've seen this happen in many other industries. And so we do expect that the growth will continue. In the fourth quarter, we had an unusually high level of installs and competitive accounts, higher than normal. And we think that the fact that there are other entrants on the market is actually bringing more trialing of our systems and creating even more interest in Mako than there had been previously. So it's a tailwind for the industry and we're going to continue to ride that tailwind. And then as it relates to international, I would say we're still -- yes, thank you. I'll just continue on international. I would say we're still in the earlier phase of that as you've seen with other robotic technologies. It starts off here and then sort of expands around the world. We're still in early phases in Japan and in China and in Latin America but the growth is really starting to pick up there. The interest level is very high. And so I'm very bullish but it's going to take longer. It's a little slower the pathway there but it's just as exciting in the international markets. Frank Pinal : Great. And just a quick follow-up. I'm just wondering if you have any updates on the spine or shoulder opportunity in robotics and if you put any sort of brackets around that with respect to timing or milestones at this point? Preston Wells : Frank, it's Preston. So at this point, as we said before, with regards to both of those different platforms that we certainly have active projects that are working on them. They are key priorities for our development teams. But at this point, we still do not have a time line that we are sharing. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Mike, please go ahead. David Saxon : Hi, good afternoon. This is David Saxon on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is just on Spine. Just wondering if you have any sense of if you've gained or lost share in the quarter. And then looking at 2022, do you think you can grow off that 2019 base? And then, I'll just ask my second question upfront. On the Foot & Ankle market, I think you've called out some weakness there. Just wondering if that's just a weak market or if you're seeing anything on the competitive front? Preston Wells : Yes. So let me address your Spine question first. I think as we've said in general throughout the pandemic, it's just very hard to get a read on how share changes are happening given some of the COVID impacts and how they impact different things regionally also just in terms of where we are in the reporting cycle. It's very early. Certainly, with Spine, just like we saw with Hips and Knees, it was impacted from a COVID perspective throughout the quarter early on as we try to recover from Delta and then with Omicron coming in later on in the back part of the quarter. So not easy to say where everybody is going to shake out from that standpoint. But certainly, outside of COVID, outside of the staffing issues that we talked about as well, we are pleased in general with our product portfolio, including enabling technologies that we have in the Spine area. As we come back from COVID and as COVID abates, we would expect the growth to uptick in that area. And certainly, as we do with all of our businesses, expect to see growth on that business as we talk about year-over-year. With regards to Foot & Ankle. Foot & Ankle, the market is still a very strong market. It's one that we're very happy about to be in. But unlike other products within the trauma or even upper extremities, Foot & Ankle was much more impacted from a COVID perspective during the quarter. And we've seen that throughout the year. But certainly, as COVID abates in that area as well, we would expect growth to really drive there. And Kevin mentioned, we have several product launches that are going to be happening in that space as well that we're very happy about. So we definitely look for growth, certainly, as COVID is starting to abate a bit to really see the growth take off in that area. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Just to put a fine point on the Foot & Ankle. So it's really the forefoot procedures that are a little bit more elective and that's where a number of our launches will happen. The Total Ankle Replacement was actually terrific in 2021, really great growth and we're going to continue to have very strong growth in Total Ankle Replacement. It's really getting the forefoot procedures to come back to the office. And as that grows, we will continue to grow. And a lot of our launches are MIS products, specifically for forefoot. David Saxon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim Securities. Chris, your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. One question, high level for you, Kevin and one specific one on Neurovascular. So given how entrenched you guys are in the hospital, I'm curious that you're thinking about the staffing challenges that we're hearing about around the health care complex. You shared some assumptions around when COVID and supply chain issues might ease. When do you think we might put the staffing piece behind us? Preston Wells : Yes. So just in terms of staffing, this is Preston. Just similar to some of these other headwinds that we talked about, the staffing challenge is a real one that certainly it seems to be much more pronounced in periods of high COVID infection rates. Obviously, as those nurses are either doing other things or in fact, impacted themselves from a COVID standpoint. So we certainly do expect the staffing challenge to remain throughout the rest of this year. But we are seeing hospitals try to find ways to deal with it, whether it's looking at traveling nurses or adjusting wages or even adjusting how they're scheduling to get through that. So while it will be a bit of a headwind, we certainly think that it's something that we will be able to work through. And as procedures return, we certainly expect to get the procedural volumes back to the levels that we would want them to be. Chris Pasquale : Okay. So you don't see that as an impediment to a bounce back in activity once COVID recedes? Preston Wells : No. Chris Pasquale : Okay. And then just quickly on Neurovascular. There's a competitor recall in the flow diverter segment during 3Q. Just curious how much you think that benefited you and if you've been able to take advantage of that to get into some new accounts? Kevin Lobo : Yes, our flow diverting stent business has been really a strength for us and it's not really so much related to competitive activities, just getting surgeons trained on the product. As you know, the Evolve stent is newer in many of the markets. It's a newer launch and we still haven't launched it in all countries around the world but we're pretty excited about the product and it's been growing at a pretty healthy rate. And there was no -- I would say, no change or no inflection point related to competitive activity. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew, the floor is yours. Matthew O'Brien: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just bigger picture question for starters is you kind of said at the Analyst Day, you're about an 8% top line grower, you're guiding now 6% to 8%, so 7% in the midpoint, 100 basis points, $170 million roughly. I'm just wondering this year, if that's really all just conservatism around the impact of COVID or if there's just some supply issues that are going to cause you to just have to back order a bunch of products and that's why you're taking it kind of down about 100 basis points versus where I think we had all kind of expected the top line guidance for the year? And then I do have one follow-up. Preston Wells : Yes. So Matt, I think as we look at 2022 and as we enter the year, similar to what we've seen in 2021, I mean, there still continues to be a lot of variability with just COVID. And so if we think about how we've entered this year with COVID being pretty high in some places and while this variant seems to happen very fast and it seems to be peaking in some areas which is encouraging, what we can't predict is where the next wave is and what might happen from a next wave standpoint. So there's a lot of variability just as we think about COVID and then we add on top of that some of the challenges and the headwinds from a supply chain perspective. And it's not to say that there's a big bolus of supply chain issues that we have. But just in general, if we think about electronics and components and some of the challenges just with supply across all industries, that's certainly something that's out there in front of us as well. So there's just a lot of variability as we think about this year in terms of some of those top line aspects that is one of the reasons why we have that wider spread and maybe a little bit lower than what some others were expecting. That being said, as Kevin outlined, there are some really, really good tailwinds that we do have as we think about entering this year, whether it be our Mako installation base and how that's going to portray into future sales there. Also the new product launches that he's outlined. Of course, we have the Vocera deal that we're hoping to close this quarter as well. So there's a lot of positive momentum that we have across our businesses that we're going to take into this year and so we're really pleased with that. But just balancing that with some of those headwinds that I outlined as well. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. But you are assuming another wave then, Preston, just to be clear on that, in the guidance? Preston Wells : Yes. As Glenn outlined in the guidance that he went through, we do have some of that assumed in that spread that we have. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Kevin, the commentary about taking competitive share or placing more Mako accounts into competitive customers really caught my attention. And what I'm wondering is if there was just a bunch of trialing that went on in Q2, Q3, you just had a massive Q4 quarter in terms of system placements and sales. Are those -- is it primarily in accounts that have a competitive robot or are launching one right now where you saw a majority of those incremental system placements here in Q4? Kevin Lobo : I don't really get into that level of detail. What I'd just say is the mix -- we used to report the mix as roughly 50% to 60% in competitive accounts. It was well north of that in the fourth quarter. Now I don't know if it's just a one quarter issue or whether that will continue. There were a lot of accounts that were kind of waiting for other offerings to appear on the market. And once those offerings appear, then they would have trials. And in most cases, it was -- in some cases, I know it was the first robot. In other cases, it may have been the second or the third robot in those accounts. I don't have exactly that level of information. But it was higher than we've seen in the past. I can't say I was expecting it. It was higher than I expected. But I am expecting Mako to continue to grow and that's not new. It's just the mix was more competitive than we've seen previously. Now, we'll see if that continues going forward. But the order book for Mako as well as for the MedSurg capital is strong at the end of the year; so that tells us that momentum will continue into 2022. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steven, please go ahead. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. I think I -- just one on the supply disruptions, particularly around electronics; I apologize if I missed this. But is the impact really on Medical solely or does it potentially have an impact on your ability in other areas, particularly to keep up with demand in Mako? Preston Wells : So the impact is primarily impacting our Medical business but there are some smaller impacts that we're seeing on some of the other MedSurg-related businesses. As we think about Mako, as we entered into 2022 and the expected demand that we have for Mako, we feel comfortable where we are in terms of supply and any impacts on Mako are minimized at this point. Steven Lichtman : Okay. And then you guys mentioned, I think, versus 2019, international performance was better than U.S. on an organic basis. As you look into '22 in your guidance, do you assume constant currency growth for international which will continue to be ahead of the U.S. or is it more balanced? How are you thinking overall about your international business versus U.S. as you look into the theater? Preston Wells : Yes. Well, we don't provide guidance at that level. We don't expect the momentum that we've generated throughout this year to slow down as we think about our international business. And quite frankly, as Kevin has pointed out in the past, this is something that we've been building towards as we think about our focus on international markets. And so there's no reason to believe that, that will slow down. Steven Lichtman : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for taking the questions guys. Just had two quick ones. One is on the supply chain assumptions, I didn't detect in your comments that you were saying supply chain specifically was impacting revenue. Is it all a cost impact? Or is there actually some product that you're not able to get out because you can't get componentry and the like? Preston Wells : Yes. So I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. So there certainly are inflationary pressures that we're feeling as a result of the supply chain and just constraints on certain materials like electronics. But that is also, in some cases, leading to some delays in terms of getting some products out. So we do have a bit of a mix as we think about supply and certainly, the procurement team, the direct procurement team is working on actively securing as much as possible. But as Glenn mentioned, sometimes what that means is going outside of our contracts into spot buys and that's what's generating some of the larger inflationary impacts as we think about the guidance that we gave. Obviously, our goal is to protect our customer needs as best as possible as we go through this but there certainly is an impact on both the top and the inflationary pieces that Glenn outlined as well. Matt Taylor : Okay, that makes sense. That's helpful. And then just one other follow-up. So it's encouraging to see the strong capital trends, especially in Mako. I guess I was wondering if you are seeing any places where capital purchasing has been weak. And I'm thinking especially beds, I think some investors are concerned that maybe beds were pulled forward because of the pandemic. So I would love any comments on that pluses and minuses in capital spending that you're seeing? Kevin Lobo : Actually, our capital order book is strong across the board. And in particular, beds had a terrific finish at the end of the year in terms of orders, a huge number of orders for our new ProCuity bed. So it's a new launch. It takes some time to go through the trialing process but we're extremely excited about our bed business. I think Glenn highlighted that in his remarks but the orders for our beds are very high, very strong. And we now have to build all the beds and make sure we have all the parts to be able to ship them all but we're very excited about the momentum; so it's broad-based. It's in our emergency care area, it's in Mako, it's in beds, it's in the Instruments division, the Endoscopy division, capital across the board is strong. Matt Taylor : Cool. Good to hear. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Joshua, your line is open. Joshua Jennings : Hi, good evening. Thanks so much. Kevin, I was hoping to have two pipeline questions. You made a big winning bet on pairing robotics with Trauson Knee. I was wondering if there -- had any change in strategy on the implant side? And anything on the manufacturing front? Is it still cost-prohibitive for 3D printing of transplant implant? And how do you see the Knee implants evolving from here under Stryker's roof? And then the second question is just, robotics on the pipeline with spine and shoulder, are there any other areas, particularly one of the question on Neurovascular, where you see robotics or a killer app in the neurovascular or any other business segments for Stryker? Kevin Lobo : Okay, great. Well, thanks. We'd like to sort of wait until we have something proven before we kind of talk about it. We are looking at femurs, in particular, cobalt chrome at different manufacturing processes for those. And once we're ready to talk about that, we'll share that. We have automated the beating that's used for the cementless part of the femur. We are constantly looking at different surface materials. But not ready to announce anything yet. I would say that the actual design of Trauson, we're really delighted with. As you saw, we came out with 3D printing, tibial baseplate, 3D printed patella to enable the cementless solution but not a fundamental change to the design. We came out with one millimeter inserts and we made other changes in, I'll say, modifications to make it easier to have a more personalized knee solution but not a fundamental redesign. So you shouldn't be expecting some kind of fundamental new design. But there will be things that we're working on that we'll be able to share with you on the knee side. Certainly, on the hip side, we have a new implant that we've talked about already earlier on that's fit for purpose for direct interior. We're very excited about that. We have a fabulous 3D-printed hip cup. But we do have instances where many surgeons are using our cup but they're using a competitive stem. And with this stem, we'll be able to convert all of their business. So that's very exciting for us. But on the Knee side, I wouldn't expect anything major new. We are working on things when we're ready, we'll be able to share that. As it relates to future applications, as you know, robotics are challenging. We're -- our main focus is really shoulder and spine right now. There are some skunkworks projects, looking at some other areas. But again, I don't want to start talking about those yet because they need to get more proven before we're ready to talk about it. In the areas of spine and shoulder, it's a matter of time. We are going to have robotic applications. But again, we don't have a time line right now but we have projects that are working on -- teams that are working on it and making very good progress. Joshua Jennings : Great, thanks. Good luck, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from Shagun Singh from RBC. Your line is open. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Firstly, what are you assuming specifically for margin expansion in the first half and the full year? And then on China, VBP, do you expect trauma and spine to be included in this year's announcement? And then just lastly, on ASCs, it's a major theme that we're hearing from hospital companies, including from HCA this morning that ortho is the latest category that's in transition from inpatient to outpatient. And I think Kevin previously had indicated about that you expect about 50% of procedures to transition and I think you gave a time line as well. Can you provide us with an update there? Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. I'll -- this is Glenn. I'll take the first one, on margin expansions. We specifically did not really guide on margin expansion just because there's a lot of volatility. I think we were trying to provide you with some good color around some of the pressures we were feeling especially on gross margin. We do expect that to be a little more pronounced in the first half of the year especially as compared to prior year. And that's the extent of the guidance that we'll provide on margin. Then I'll hand it to Preston. Preston Wells : So yes, Shagun, just back to your ASC question, as I talked about before, we do expect that transition to continue. In terms of a time line, I mean, I think a lot of it is just going to depend on how capacity is built and how we're able to continue to transition patients and surgeons to that setting. Certainly as we think about the ASC offense that we've created, we are here and actually helping to make that transition happen. So we certainly would expect our large joints to continue to make that shift as well. And I apologize, I forgot your second question that you had in there. Glenn Boehnlein : I guess she is not there [ph]. And we can go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Jayson, please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, it's a little granular but in those geographies that have seen COVID cases that have rolled over, have you seen a pickup in volume growth? Preston Wells : So I would say that it's spotty. I mean I think just like how we thought about COVID throughout the last 24 months or so, you will, as COVID cases start to decline and as hospitals are able to get capacity up and running, we know they will. And so certainly, as that happens with this wave, we will start to see procedures picking back up in those areas as well. Kevin Lobo : But it does vary by market. So in Australia, we definitely saw a big pickup as soon as they resume electives, the pickup is pretty swift. I would say the U.K. is similar. But then in other markets, whether it's Japan or whether it's Southern Europe, it's a little bit more gradual, the increase. So there isn't one answer but we do know is these patients are going to need their procedures. The pace of the recovery, honestly, is quite difficult to generalize because it does behave differently by country. We are expecting that there will be a pickup and we look forward to that. Jayson Bedford : Okay, that's fair. And just secondly, on the Wright integration, you guys have done a great job here in the U.S. Just wondering, on international, how much work is left on the integration? And should we expect to see a pickup in international extremity growth in '22? Preston Wells : Yes. We continue to work through the international integration. I would say that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to make progress in that space. And as we do, certainly, we should continue to see a pickup internationally as well. Kevin Lobo : Yes, it's -- the international market certainly lagged the U.S. We had distributor contracts and arrangements that we had to get out of. And so we always plan for that to be a little later. And so we didn't have any -- the kind of results internationally that we did in the U.S. but that wasn't a surprise to us. And you will see a gradual pickup in the international markets. We're quite excited because, obviously, Stryker has a larger footprint internationally and really a better home for the Wright Medical products and that should be an engine of growth in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff, your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, but Glenn, totally respect that you haven't guided to the operating margin line. But I think when we connect the dots between your revenue guidance, your gross margin guidance, your EPS guidance. I mean, simple math is kind of getting me -- it could be up -- operating margin could be up a very little bit to down 30, 40 basis points. Just directionally, is my math kind of right there? Or should I rethink some of my math. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Jeff, yes, I think your -- the math is pretty obvious. I think if you take all the pieces. So, I imagine that your model probably will reflect that. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle, your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks so much. Hey guys, good afternoon. Thank you so much for squeezing me in here. I just have one question and sorry to belabor the whole COVID recovery, etcetera, point. But just curious about how to think about this recovery post surge or post wave versus past recoveries. I'm thinking of post-Q -- sorry, Q2 of last year, even really Q2 of 2020 when things first opened up. You really saw a bolus but it feels like because of the hospital staffing shortages, this might be a little bit more linear in nature. I know it's probably very difficult to get granular here but just curious about what you're hearing, how you guys are thinking about the recovery curve itself? Preston Wells : Yes, Danielle, you're right. It is a difficult thing to predict. And certainly, as we go back to 2020, I think you saw that big bolus pickup, if you remember how far down it was at the end of Q2. We certainly have not seen that same level of drop-off with these subsequent waves. So I think linear and gradual is probably the way to think about it, certainly muted a little bit by some of the staffing pieces. But I would say linear and gradual as we continue to come out of this recovery. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, that's it for me. Thanks. Operator : And our last question today comes from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. Drew, please proceed with your question. Drew Ranieri : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe one for Glenn, just on cash flow for 2022. Can you provide any type of framework for cash flow from operations? I think you mentioned CapEx but just curious what you're seeing and -- or expecting and any type of working capital improvements you're kind of working on in 2022? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, great question. I think as we think about cash flow, we've really come a long way, especially from where we were in 2019 and especially a lot of the muscle and discipline that we've built around working capital management. So all of that will roll into this year 2022 and the benefits associated with that. I think there will be some spending that was somewhat muted and deferred in the past, especially around CapEx. And so right now, we're estimating approximately $650 million of CapEx. That being said, we generally target that 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. I know we've beaten that over the last couple of years but we've also seen reduced spending in a lot of areas that I think will start to pick up, especially as we exit this and kind of try to get to a more normal operating environment. So I think that's probably what we're targeting. There could be some variability depending on how COVID plays out through the year. Drew Ranieri : And Kevin, just one for you. You kind of touched on the Insignia launch and your expectation that it's going to drive more Mako utilization over time. But near term, maybe in 2022 as you're launching this at AAOS, I mean would you expect to get up to 30% utilization for hips on Mako? Or is there kind of a stretch goal that you have in mind for the year? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Actually, for this year, I'm more concerned really with just getting great uptake with the stem, whether it's with Mako or without Mako. We've already done a limited launch. Feedback has been incredibly positive from surgeons in terms of the broaching of the implant, the size options, the experience that they're having is really terrific. So in this first year, the Mako utilization is less important to me than really satisfying the surgeon's need for this product and really getting into DA. And I expect the Mako number will continue to rise. It could hit 30%, absolutely. But more importantly is really having success with the stem both manually as well as with Mako. And the full launch we expect will be in the second quarter. So, we'll really start to see a bigger impact in the second half of the year, but there will be some impact in the first half but much more towards the second half of the year. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So, thank you all for joining our call and for all your questions. As you can see, we had a very strong finish to 2021. We are working through the challenging environment right now. And you can see that the company is well positioned to fight through it. We are going to continue to invest for the future and make sure that as things improve in the environment that we're poised to capitalize on that and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your line.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Stryker's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brika, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC.  Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Preston Wells, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter as well as recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A.  For the quarter, organic sales growth exceeded 9% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses delivered high single-digit growth, highlighting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, we posted mid-single-digit organic growth, highlighted by double-digit organic growth in Europe and emerging markets.  During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges, mostly affecting our large capital businesses.  For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.97, reflecting growth compared to the first quarter of 2021 despite the ongoing impacts from inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these supply chain pressures to persist throughout the year, although they will moderate with less reliance on spot buys in the second half of the year. In addition, we continue to invest in R&D at a healthy rate of 7.2% of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on our new product pipelines.  Despite the ongoing supply chain pressures and the continued COVID volatility in certain regions of the world, we remain confident in the outlook of our business, and we expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. However, as previously mentioned, despite continued discipline with our spending, the pressure on our supply chain will impact our ability to deliver earnings leverage in 2022.  With one quarter behind us, a very strong order book and these macroeconomic dynamics, we now expect full year organic sales growth towards the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8% and expect adjusted earnings per share at the lower end of our guidance range of $9.60 to $10 a share.  During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Vocera, and I'm excited about the highly complementary and innovative portfolio that Vocera brings to our Medical division. We believe that this deal will drive strong value creation in the years ahead.  Finally, I am pleased about our ongoing commitment to our talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 12th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Over this time, our employee base has moved from 20,000 to 46,000, and I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture as we have grown.  In addition, we also published our second annual comprehensive report during the quarter, which captures our environmental, social and governance strategy and details our commitments and disclosures on our 3 pillars of corporate responsibility : stronger people, healthier planet and good business.  Overall, I am pleased with our start to the year despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and believe we are well positioned for the future.  I will now turn the call over to Preston. Preston Wells : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical and the initial integration progress of the Vocera business.  After being impacted in January by the Omicron variant, procedural volumes recovered sequentially throughout the quarter as COVID-related delays and restrictions eased. While we see -- while we're seeing volumes recover towards more normal levels, there continues to be some overhang from hospital staffing shortages, which is causing scheduling disruptions around the world. This improvement in procedural volumes is primarily impacting our implant-related businesses, including Hips, Knees, Spine and Extremities. In addition to the procedural recovery, our double-digit growth in Knees continues to benefit from the growing Mako install base. We also grew high single digits in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Hips, driven by continued new product penetration. Within our Hips business, the launch of the new Insignia Hip Stem, along with the Mako 4.1 software, which also incorporates Insignia into the Mako robotic platform, continues to proceed well and should be a tailwind to our Hips business throughout the year.  Geographically, procedures recovered during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America, which resulted in strong double-digit growth in those regions. Procedural trends in Asia have been more volatile due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts. With Japan and Australia beginning to see improvements towards the end of the quarter, while other parts of the region saw COVID rates peak in March. In China, COVID-related impacts were more widely seen beginning in March, and we expect to see negative impact on procedural volumes in China during the second quarter as a result of strict lockdown restrictions across major cities in the country.  Demand for our capital products remained strong in the quarter, including double-digit growth in orders, which bolstered the strong order book for capital products that we carried over from 2021. As a reminder, our capital business makes up less than 25% of our total sales with under 10% coming from large capital items like beds, robotics, booms and lights, and the remainder coming from small capital products like power tools and cameras, which facilitate surgical procedures. The strong demand in the quarter is occurring across our portfolio, including our small capital products within Instruments, Endoscopy and Neurocranial that support the recovery of procedural volumes. While we experienced solid growth from our capital businesses in the quarter, the growth was limited as a result of ongoing headwinds, including raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays because of hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages have had the largest impact in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. These macro challenges will continue to be pronounced in the second quarter. We continue to partner closely with our customers to ensure we are meeting their more immediate and longer-term capital requirements.  Turning to our key integration activities. The integration of Vocera is in its early stages, and we are pleased with how the teams are working together to maximize the opportunity. On a pro forma basis, the Vocera business continued its strong double-digit momentum during the quarter. And finally, the Wright Medical integration continues to progress well across all regions, which is reflected in the double-digit growth of our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business during the quarter, which was led by excellent performances in both U.S. Foot & Ankle and U.S. Upper Extremities.  In summary, while the macro environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remains strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive market-leading growth.  With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Preston. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Similar to last quarter, sales comments will be provided based on our new reporting structure. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.  Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter. The first quarter's average selling days were in line with Q1 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1%. Foreign currency had an unfavorable 1.8% impact on sales.  During the quarter, we saw a recovery of surgical procedures and accelerated sales momentum as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has eased in the U.S. and Europe. However, our sales growth has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses and primarily our Medical business.  Our capital order book has continued to be very robust as demand from our customers has continued to be strong. For the quarter, U.S. organic sales increased by 10.5%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in many of our businesses. International organic sales showed growth of 6%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe and emerging markets, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia, Canada and China. Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.97 increased 2.1%, reflecting sales growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate and gross margin inflationary pressures. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted from foreign currency by $0.02 versus 2021. Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.1%, with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 12.2% of U.S. organic growth.  Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.3%, led by strong growth in their orthopedic instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses, highlighted by growth in SurgiCount, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.7%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of their communications and Sports Medicine businesses.  The Medical business, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, which closed in February, had U.S. organic sales growth of 6.2%, reflecting solid performances in their stage and acute care businesses, somewhat offset by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products.  During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our acute care and emergency care businesses, driven by very strong demand. Assuming normalization of the customer environment and certain reduction of certain supply constraints, we expect these orders to contribute to another strong year for Medical in 2022.  Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.4% versus a very strong comparable growth of approximately 20% in 2021. The U.S. Neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 16.6%, which included solid growth in our max space, NSE drills and bioreabsorbable products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in the Endoscopy and Neurovascular businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China and Australia.  Orthopaedics & Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 7.2%, which included 8.2% of organic growth in the U.S. This reflects the impact of the ramp-up in surgical procedures during the quarter.  Our Hips business grew 8.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and improved underlying market dynamics. Our Knee business grew 17.5% organically in the U.S., reflecting the previously mentioned strong recovery of procedures and our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma & Extremities business grew 10.6% organically, reflecting double-digit growth in Foot & Ankle, Upper Extremities and Biologics. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.7% organically, led by the performance of our enabling technology products. Other ortho declined organically in the U.S. as the impact of hospital operational staffing challenges and lengthening purchasing cycles limited our ability to place Makos during the quarter. Comparatively, in Q1 2021, other ortho had growth of 49%. Assuming normalization of the customer environment, we expect another strong year for Mako in 2022.  Internationally, Orthopaedics & Spine grew 4.8% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as surgical procedures ramped up as well as a strong performance in Hips and Knees in Japan, somewhat offset by lingering COVID challenges in Australia, Canada and China. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.1% was unfavorable approximately 130 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. Compared to prior year, our gross margin was adversely impacted by purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, electronic components, steel and transportation costs as well as operational inefficiencies due to the aforementioned raw material shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022 and to be more pronounced in the first half of this year.  Adjusted R&D spending was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 35 basis point increase versus first quarter of 2021, and this reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth it will provide. Our SG&A was 35.1% of sales, which was 5 basis points lower compared to the first quarter of 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by the ramping of certain expenses and hiring to support future growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.8% of sales, which is approximately 160 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and other continued investments in innovation, somewhat offset by our sales momentum and cost discipline.  Other income and expense decreased as compared to the first quarter in 2021, primarily resulting from an equity investment gain as well as lower interest expense. Our first quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 16%.  Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.9 billion, which includes the additional $1.5 billion of debt raised to fund the Vocera acquisition. During the quarter, our long-term credit rating at S&P was downgraded from A- to BBB+, and our long-term rating at Moody's was reaffirmed at Baa1.  Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 cash from operations was $203 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of prebuying certain electronic component inventory and approximately $130 million of charges related to the stock compensation payments for the Vocera acquisition that are accounted for in operating cash flow.  Given the dynamic supply chain pressures, COVID uncertainty, strong order book for capital equipment and considering our first quarter results, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth towards the high end of our previously guided range of 6% to 8%. This performance assumes that the recovery environment experienced in Q1 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with a normal procedure environment, returning during the second half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 1.2%. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be reversely impacted by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in the full year, and this is included in our guidance range. Based on our performance in the first quarter and including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges, the inflationary environment and the anticipated impact related to foreign currency. We expect adjusted net earnings -- adjusted earnings per share towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of $9.60 to $10 per share. The low end of the guidance range assumes the continued macro environmental volatility persists, including inflationary pressures that could impact costs, particularly our cost of sales and includes more transient spot buying and longer-term supply chain challenges.  We will continue to evaluate the changing environment, and we'll provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now I will open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a strong [indiscernible]here. Maybe one on the capital environment, Kevin. There's been a lot of questions on the hospital capital budget cycle. Maybe talk about your order book, how it's perhaps different? And I couldn't help but observe the other line item, which includes Mako was down year-on-year. I understand it's a tough comp, was it just comps? Or anything to do with the capital cycle here? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sure, Vijay. First, I'd tell you that hospital liquidity is still very strong. And as a result, our orders have actually grown in the quarter. We had a strong order book coming into the year, and we added to that very significantly with strong double-digit growth in orders in the first quarter.  And as we mentioned in our opening remarks, large capital has been disrupted partially because of shortages of primarily electronics, but also hospital's ability to actually receive the capital either because of short staffing or because some of their construction projects were delayed.  I'm not concerned about the shortage in other ortho for the first quarter. Our order book for Mako is very, very strong. We had a lot of delays in actually installations, and they're going to have a strong year overall. And certainly, we did have a big comp from the prior year. But the order book for Mako is very strong. The order book for all of our capital is very strong. You saw the actual sales results in Instruments, Endoscopy, Neurocranial. The small capital, in fact, is -- we're able to largely meet those orders that were growing our challenges is meeting the orders of larger capital, primarily Medical, but also to a lesser degree to Mako. But overall, no concerns, strong demand for Mako and you saw the results in the Hip and Knee business that really benefits from the strong performance we had in Mako throughout the pandemic. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Kevin. And maybe one on guidance here. To one off of a really strong start here, 9% organic, guide 6% to 8% now looks like you guys are pointing towards the high end, is there perhaps some conservatism baked in when you look at the back half? Certainly, your comps are 7% average for the back half. If the recovery trends do persist, perhaps it seems like the top line is a little conservative, maybe walk us through the assumptions for the back half. Kevin Lobo : Well, we're not going to give guidance by quarter, Vijay. But what I would tell you is the second quarter, we have very difficult comps. If you remember, the second quarter of last year was extremely strong. And yes, you're right that Q3 and Q4, the comps do get a lot easier. I would say that we are still a little bit nervous about our ability to meet the demand for these orders and capital because of the supply chain pressure. So there is a little bit of conservatism based into that just because the environment is pretty uncertain. We do assume an improvement -- continued improvement in procedural volumes. If that continues to play out well, and certainly, there is the potential for us to do even better than what we've guided.  But based on what we know today, that we feel pretty good about sales at the high end of the original range given the strong start to the year and the strong order book. Operator : We now have the next question from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Congrats on a really strong quarter. Kevin, I'll ask the question because I'm sure folks are wondering, and then I have 1 quick follow-up, if that's all right. But just to follow-up on Vijay's question about the robot trends, is this a -- would you say this is a -- these are challenges that all competitors across large capital robots and otherwise are having -- putting systems into hospitals at the moment? Or in other words, would you expect that these aren't things that are going to put you at a disadvantage competitively over the next several quarters? And I have just one quick follow-up. Preston Wells : Hey, Matt, it's Preston. You're right. It's something that we're seeing across the board. As Kevin said, it's really more of the macro elements around the ability for hospitals to be able to put the equipment in and get it installed that's driving it. And so that's something that everybody is facing heard that from several folks as well. So it's not something that puts us at a disadvantage at all. As Kevin mentioned, we feel very strong about where we're headed for Mako and what we're expecting to deliver for Mako this year. Matthew Miksic : Great. And then a follow-up on Hips, just to give us some perspective. It was a really nice bump up here on the back of these launches that you described. I'm just wondering if you could give us some sense of how confident we should be about that going forward? Or is there some trialing? Or there's a couple of quarters here that we should sort of need to digest the interest in the hips? Or do you really feel like you've turned the corner? Preston Wells : Yes. I would say that we certainly are very pleased with the initial launch of Insignia as we recently just launched at AAOS. So it's certainly an indication as we think about going forward and what we expect to drive from our Hips. So we're happy with the initial phases of the launch. We expect Insignia will continue to provide a tailwind along with Mako, along with the recovery of procedural volumes. Operator : We now have a question from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask on down the P&L, and you mentioned cost headwinds a couple of times during the presentation, and you were able to still hold the guidance range, albeit at the lower end. I was just hoping maybe you could walk us through sizing some of these impacts and the cadence as it flows into and out of the P&L as we start thinking about building second, third and fourth quarter? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Robbie, I would tell you that when we gave guidance back in January, we discussed pressure of 50 to 100 basis points on our gross margin. And I would tell you that, that is looking like it is trending to the upper end for the full year. And if I think about where we're going to feel most of that pronounced increase, it's probably Q1 and Q2 here with some easing in Q3 and Q4.  If you think about the types of costs, obviously, there are these spot buys where we're paying pretty exorbitant prices for chips and the related electronic components. But there are also increases in labor or supplier labor, warehouse and distribution costs are going up.  And then related to that, just because of supply shortages, we're also feeling a little bit of the inefficiencies that, that might be driving in our own manufacturing facilities. So all of those are obviously putting pressure on our gross margin. Then the last thing I'll mention, and I know this has probably come up in other calls is just freight is another place where we're seeing real increases. And a lot of that is just because of the tight supply chain and even the tightness of our ability to deliver products to our customers, we're seeing a lot of overnight deliveries. We're seeing a lot more air freight when normally we would use a more economical mode for freight. So all of that is kind of compounding in terms of what we're implying as inflationary pressures.  I do see some of that easing up, but I would tell you for the longer term, these labor costs, these transportation costs are probably a little more permanent than some of the other costs as we think about it. And then moving down the P&L, if you think about what we're spending in R&D, we just -- we're not backing off of that innovation spend. We really honestly think it's very important to keep that product pipeline going and keep it robust. Launches like our Insignia Hip, we're going to be able to fuel growth as long as we continue to fund that R&D.  On the -- further down in SG&A, we have tried to moderate some of the more discretionary SG&A costs. But the single biggest cost there is sales commissions. And as long as our sales force are out there selling, we're going to continue to pay them and pay them well because it's important to us. Beyond that, we have some moderation in other income and expense, and I gave you the guidance on tax. So I think we're trending pretty much in line with all of that. Robert Marcus : Great. I appreciate that. If I could sneak one quick follow-up in, we heard from Baxter this morning, they have a growing order book like you, and they're hoping to be able to shorten it and sell-through throughout 2022. Is that your expectation as well that the chip supply should improve, and you'll be able to clear a lot of the order book within 2022? Preston Wells : Yes, Robbie. I think that we certainly believe that we're going to work through that backlog. It's still early days as we're confronted with the supply challenges. And we're certainly working actively with those chip suppliers and trying to get through. And as Kevin mentioned, certainly, second quarter will be a little bit more disrupted than we think about the later part of the year. So we'll work through it throughout the year.  We're not -- as we think about our overall guidance and certainly getting to that upper end or exceeding that upper end, would be working all the way through the entirety of that backlog. So right now, what we're doing is really focused on just getting the supply and working through it for the remainder of the year. Operator : We now have Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Just -- I wanted to start with the inflation and pricing. So just how are you guys kind of managing the rising cost? And what's your ability to offset it? And where are you guys able to take price? It looks like price got a little better, if I'm looking at Q1 versus Q4, if I'm looking at that correctly. And I have 1 follow-up. Preston Wells : Yes, Larry, thanks for the question. So we're looking at it a few different ways. So obviously, we continue to focus on some of the internal projects that we had going with CTG 2.0 that are really looking at how we change our cost structure. But beyond that, we are looking at areas around price.  And just as a reminder, we do have some businesses that historically we've been able to gain some price in particularly on our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses. But as we look at all of our businesses in the future, as we have contracts that are coming up on our orthopedic side, we will be looking at whatever price actions that are appropriate at that point in time.  And along the MedSurg business, again, same thing, we'll be looking at price actions as appropriate going forward. So we are looking at that as a way to continue to help with the rise in inflation. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then I know China is small for you guys, but a little more color on what you're seeing on the ground there from the lockdowns and your expectations for the VBP for Recon, which it seems like it's delayed to the second quarter? And then Trauma and Neurovascular, if there's anything on the horizon there? Preston Wells : Yes. So Larry, on China, as you mentioned, it is small. It's about 2% of our total business. And those products that are being currently impacted by VBP, so think about joint replacement, trauma and extremities, are less than half of that. And so we have that factored into our guidance. We've talked about that before. So we're expecting that to really play out this year from a trauma and joint replacement standpoint.  Neurovascular, it's early days. There are some activities happening at a province level. So we're still early in that process and don't really expect any major impacts there for 2022.  In terms of what we're seeing on the ground with regards to the COVID impacts, we're saying the same thing that everybody else is hearing. The strict lockdown policy is certainly having an impact on procedural volume. And we expect that to continue to play out in second quarter. Where it goes from there, I think, is still to be determined. But we would expect probably easing as they go through this latest wave, look probably towards the back half in terms of procedural volumes. Operator : The next question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne Wuensch : I want to spend a little bit of time talking about Vocera, the closing of it and your expectations for growth in revenue in this fiscal year? Preston Wells : Yes, Joanne, thanks for the question on both. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's very early. I mean we just closed the deal in February. When we announced the deal, we talked about our general expectations in this marketplace where the market and the sales are growing in the teens. And so we would expect that to continue initially. But as we get it integrated into our businesses that we're going to be able to accelerate the growth of Vocera by being able to put it into more hands and more hospitals. So we do expect that we'll be accelerating throughout the year. But again, we're early, early days in terms of the integration. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The only thing I'd add, Joanne, is so far so good in terms of retention. We were able to retain a lot of the employees that we had identified, frankly, all of the key employees have been retained. And the integration efforts, even though it's early, we had a very good month of March, no disruption whatsoever in the sales cycle. So while it is early, so far, so good, and we're very bullish on the prospects. So Vocera having a very good year this year and obviously continuing into the future. Joanne Wuensch : But to put a little finer point on that, what is your expected impact on revenue and EPS? Because we have organic revenue, and we have an EPS range, and I would assume this is incorporated in your updated guidance. Kevin Lobo : It is incorporated in our updated guidance. As we said from the beginning, we expect them to continue. And you'll see it in the inorganic numbers. Every quarter, you'll see where Vocera shows up, you will see very strong double-digit growth on the top line. And what we said on the bottom line is that it certainly -- there's a modest impact on the bottom line. So really, nothing really more to add there. We're going to fuel the growth. It will be a good year this year, and it will be accretive starting next year Operator : We now have Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : One more question on the inflationary pressures. Can you provide some color on what percent the products came freight versus raw materials versus labor? I'm just trying to understand how much of this pressure is sort of permanent like labor, let's stick around in 2023. You said that the prices are trending to the high end of 100 basis points you talked about last quarter. What do you assume that ends in the fourth quarter? Preston Wells : Yes. So Peter, we aren't going to provide that breakout in terms of the various parts of the business. I mean it does continue to fluctuate around depending on where some of the shortages are. Like Glenn said, if we have supply shortages, we are seeing increases in freight that's more mix based on airfreight and things like that.  So going to provide that breakout. Certainly, we do expect, as Glenn mentioned, there are going to be some portions of this that will be more permanent in nature and some of that will be more transient as we go through where it lands. I think we're still early. And certainly, as we think about our guidance that we laid out, we do expect it to have impact as we continue throughout the year, but certainly within the range of the guidance that we provided. Philip Chickering : Okay. And then talking to you about the hospitals recently, they're talking about a lot of supply inflation that they're seeing. Just back there with the pricing question, do you guys think that you have the ability to pass on some price help off to some of these inflationary pressures? And kind of how should we think about price for different divisions or different geographies? Preston Wells : Yes. So I think the answer is yes. I mean we are evaluating that. We're looking at pricing actions across our businesses, and it will be different. It will be different based on the different types of businesses that we're in, the contracts that are in place and in different geographies for sure. So it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all as we think about this, it will be a very deliberate approach across our different business units and across our different geographies. Philip Chickering : Let me just -- to quantify that, if a negative 1% price or in the first quarter, I think we end the year sort of flat? Or kind of how much price that we can get during the year? Preston Wells : Yes, not something that we're guiding on. Operator : We now have a question from Ryan Zimmerman of BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : I want to follow up on a couple of things. Glenn, on your comments on EPS guidance, you said that you continue to expect more transient spot buying and long-term supply challenges. I think that was pretty clear in your messaging. But as I think about companies like Hologic last night, who saw incremental headwinds on some of these electronic components more than they initially thought. I mean how derisked have you -- I mean at the low end of that 9 60, how comfortable are you that if this market gets worse for electronics that we wouldn't have to go lower? I mean, how much have you incorporated there, I guess? Kevin Lobo : Yes. That's a tough question. I mean I think I don't have a crystal ball. What I do have is I can see what we have prebought in our inventory. I do have the input from our suppliers and how they are looking at that sort of chip availability.  And I also see the amount of activity that we have currently ongoing in terms of buying in that spot market. And I would tell you that Q2 is probably going to look pretty similar to Q1 in terms of that kind of pressure. But I am building up inventories and I'm building up component inventories. And so I expect it to ease a little bit as I look at Q3 and Q4. And I think right now, that's the best I can do in terms of sort of eyeballing in where I think the impact of that will be in the P&L and also in terms of where our guidance has come in.  I think we didn't lower our guidance from Q -- from January because we still saw a pathway to get within this guidance based on the activity we're seeing now. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then Kevin, I appreciate the comments about Neurovascular having a tough comp. But as we think about that market, particularly in the U.S., and the product profile today, how do you think about the long-term growth rate in the Neurovascular segment given kind of where we're at? And the performance we saw this quarter? And what gets you back to kind of that sustained long-term growth rate? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, I still think this is a fabulous market long term. There's just no question. It's a great market. We had a tough comp -- there also was a bit of competitive activity in the U.S. in the ischemic side of the business. We see this from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So we certainly weren't expecting double-digit growth in the U.S. It was a little lower than we expected because of the competitive activity, but nothing too alarming.  And we will have a very strong year. We're going to have a double-digit growth year in neurovascular globally, and the U.S. will pick up in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So it's still a great market. We're only treating a small fraction of the patients that have stroke today. And for that reason, with the pipeline and the great leadership team that we have over there in Neurovascular, I know that this is going to be a very good long-term business. Operator : We now have David Saxon of Needham & Company. David Saxon : Just wanted to get a sense on if you're seeing backlog procedures come back? And if so, kind of where you're seeing those concentrated whether it's Hips or Knees or Spine? Preston Wells : Yes. Thanks for the question. So in terms of the backlog, as we've said in previous calls, the backlog has built up over really the last 24 months as many patients hadn't had procedures done. So certainly, we saw that the uptick with procedures being done this past quarter. It's hard to say what portion of that was backlog versus new patients entering into the funnel. So there has to be some piece of that backlog that's been worked down. But really, for the full backlog to be worked through, it's going to take a sustained recovery. So we're thinking about many quarters of recovery and being back to normal that's going to get that backlog all the way down.  In terms of where it's coming from, it's really going to be across all of those products that are more deferrable. So Hips, Knees, Spine, some of the Extremities products that we would expect to see that coming from. But as we've said previously, really, it's going to take several quarters of sustained normal that will work that full backlog down. David Saxon : Okay. Great. And just on the U.S. spine 3.7% growth. Just wonder, how you think you did from a market share perspective? And what's driving your growth? Preston Wells : Yes, it's early in terms of the overall market growth assessment. But just like we look at Hips and Knees, we're pleased with the quarter. We're pleased with procedures recovering, certainly having an impact on Spine. We're happy with our product portfolio. And so we do expect that Spine will continue to benefit as procedures come back to more normal levels throughout the rest of the year. Operator : The next question is from Matt O'Brien of Piper Sandler. Andrew Stafford : This is Drew on for Matt. I just want to follow up on Vocera with maybe a little bit more of a high-level question. We're obviously translating -- transitioning from pandemic to a postpandemic environment, which will presumably result in the changes in some hostile environment have operated compared to the last couple of years. Is that changing how your customers are thinking about the value proposition or use case for Vocera at all? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think the pressure that's being put on the health care system and particularly nurses was obviously very acute during the pandemic. And with the shortages that are out there right now, hospitals are looking for solutions that are going to help keep their nurses engaged, help ensure that their errors aren't being made in the hospital, improved workflow, so I think our timing is perfect and that Vocera should be able -- this is a tailwind that's not over. I think this tailwind will continue to last for the next couple of years because it does provide really a reduced cognitive load for nurses. It makes their jobs easier. They're much happier when we have Vocera in their hospitals. So we're really excited. We think our timing is really ideal, and this is a multiyear tailwind. Operator : We now have Jason Wittes of Loop Capital. Jason Wittes : Just on cash flows. Obviously, you're having some P&L impact from inflationary expenses. How is that impacting your cash flows? And generally speaking, what sort of cash flow generation should we anticipate for this year?  And I guess related to that, when do you think you get back to a point where we could see another Vocera-like-sized acquisition from Stryker? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I'll tell you what, I'll take the cash flow one, and I'll have Preston talk about the M&A one. So on cash flows, a couple of places. We're feeling the inflationary pressures that flow through with earnings first and foremost. And we'll see that all year long as those flow through all the way to cash flow. I think the other thing that you can see is that because we're in a position where we're prebuying inventories and raw material inventories to make sure we have enough supply, we'll see increases in inventory that may be, under normal conditions, we wouldn't necessarily have.  In terms of where I think cash flows will land, I still think we're seeing really good performance in working capital. We're performing relative to guidance in terms of CapEx spending, and so those fundamentals are still in place. And I would still expect us to deliver sort of a 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion, excluding the Vocera impact related to that acquisition, the $130 million that related to a payout of -- related to the employees' acceleration of options in their stock. So aside from that, we'll still be in that 70% to 80% range. Preston Wells : Yes. So in terms of -- sorry, in terms of acquisition activities as we move forward, as we've said previously, following the Vocera deal, our first focus is going to be on pay down of the debt. And then we'll certainly continue to evaluate tuck-in opportunities along the way as well.  As we think about larger type deals like Vocera, it really is going to depend on a couple of things. I think, number one, the cash flow performance, as Glenn mentioned before. And then the second is really going to be about the opportunities. I mean we're not going to just do larger-sized deals just to do them. Certainly, it's going to be the right opportunities. I think, overall, just thinking about it, we still have the bandwidth to continue to operate in that space and complete those type tuck-ins and eventually get back to a Vocera-type-sized deal. Matthew Miksic : I appreciate that detail. If I could just maybe a clarification on Mako. Did I hear you earlier specify that there were still some staffing issues sort of impacting installations there? Or did I mishear that? Just curious about the dynamics right now for installing Mako systems. Preston Wells : No, that's correct. I think a lot of times when we talk about staffing, we immediately think about just the nursing staffing component, but staffing has been an impact at all different types of areas across the hospital. And so with a lot of our larger capital items, we've seen some delays in installations or even just in construction projects that have led to some of those delays in Mako was impacted by that during the quarter as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri from Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ranieri : Just more of a product question, and then I had a follow-up. But you guys highlighted Q guidance and System 8 power tools kind of AAOS, I know that they were more limited launches here in 2022. But just given the macro factors here, supply chain disruptions. I mean, does that really stall what we could expect these products to deliver in 2023 with your spine growth or any pull-through there with enabling technologies or pricing benefits on the power tools? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I mean, at this point, I would say there's no -- we're obviously not giving guidance on 2023. But in terms of those products, still early Q guidance not is still in the approval process. So we still have a ways to go there. But in terms of the next power tools, also similar we're still early in terms of getting that out from a launch standpoint next year. So at this point, no update in terms of major impacts or expectations to what it might have on our numbers for next year. Andrew Ranieri : Okay. And then just with Insignia, I think it was also highlighted that instrument tray, it's more attuned for ASC usage. So is there anything that you're seeing with the recent launch that really shows that ASCs are being receptive? Or is just the general environment may be masking any uptake there of the new platform at ASCs? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So what I'd say is Insignia product is ideal for direct interior, which, of course, is very popular in the ASCs. But not just in the ASCs, also in the hospital. And even though we only launched it very recently, the feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we have a great design for the product. Surgeons are finding it terrific approaching the offsets, the sizes, the fit that it's really delivering on what we thought. So we couldn't be happier with the launch at least this initial phase of the launch. And this will be a tailwind for our Hip business, and it will actually pick up as more and more sets are deployed in the field, you'll see it actually accelerate through Q3, Q4 and into next year. Operator : Thank you. We now have Joshua Jennings of Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Just two, one on just the natural margin tailwind, Glenn, that you talked about earlier in the year, potentially driving some operating margin expansion at least by the fourth quarter. Can you just help maybe frame that up a little bit better? Just thinking about you're not guiding to upside to the 6% to 8% range, we're getting to the top but getting through that top end of the revenue guidance range. Just how impactful that natural margin tailwind from increased volume could be? Any quantification, it's probably hard, but would be helpful even directionally. And then just was curious, Kevin and Preston on just the strong recovery in Knees and Hips versus Spine. I mean, Spine is recovering but not as quickly. And any thoughts on just why Spine market recovery or volume recovery is a little bit slower than Knees and Hips so far in 2022? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Josh, I think I heard your question right, is what kind of op margin lift could we get out of sales performance that's above the 10%. So a couple of things. And anything that we delivered above the 10% would still have that kind of gross margin and inflation overhang. So we would feel that pressure. But you are correct that there's a natural operating expense leverage that incur that we incur when we sort of pierce through some of those larger double-digit growth items. So I expect that you would see delivery at the op margin level in excess of where you're seeing us now that the 22% roughly. So it would be accretive to that for sure. Kevin Lobo : Yes. On your second question around the spine market versus hip and knee market, even if you go back to pre-pandemic, the hip and knee market was growing on a dollar basis was growing faster than the spine market. And the spine market did have some elements of the more acute procedures that were less deferrable. And so it didn't decline nearly as much as the hip and knee business did. So not as much of a decline. And then, therefore, not as much of a pickup in a market that, frankly, hasn't been historically growing quite as fast as Hips and Knees. So those are the dynamics, I think, that you're seeing play out here. We're delighted with our performance certainly in our -- if you look at our Knee business and Hips just this quarter, we were leading the market in Knees for a long time. Mako has been an enormous driver. Our cementless procedures are roughly 1 out of every 2 knees in the United States are going in cementless. So we have a real competitive advantage that you're seeing play out with our Knee number, but excited that our Hip number is now moving up as well. But I'm not surprised to see those growing faster than the Spine business. We'll have to see when everyone else reports how the markets played out. But to me, it's not that surprising. Operator : We now have a question from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : Just a quick question on -- I'm not going to ask about inflationary pressures per se, but what I am going to ask is supply constraints that you saw if there's any way, I know there's a lot of balls in the air as far as trying to nail down the different impacts to the top line in the quarter between COVID and supply constraints things like that, but whether you can quantify, even just directionally, the impact from the supply constraints that you did see in the quarter? And then I have 1 follow-up on the backlog. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, nothing that we're going to specifically quantify with regard to that. I mean we still had pretty strong growth in our MedSurg businesses, which are -- where primarily our capital businesses are. But just know that there was impact in that -- those sales as a result.  As we mentioned, from an electronic component standpoint, primarily in the medical business as opposed to some of the others. But not something that we're going to quantify. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a commentary on the backlog. The question I have there is, if there's still backlog being worked down in such a meaningful way, is this impacting the referral chain at all? And I guess what I'm getting about is -- getting at is how this impacts sort of midterm growth, sort of once we're through the acute COVID period, I'm trying to think about hospital staffing issues and how all of these reconciles and what this means for really midterm growth less near term? Glenn Boehnlein : No. I think if I understand your question correctly, I mean I think the way we have to think about this is we've had 24 months of irregular activity with regards to these procedures. And so throughout that time period, we've seen that backlog, quite frankly, just grow. I mean the number of people that haven't had procedures done as a result, whether they're currently in the funnel, whether they've been deferred from the funnel. And then as we keep going forward, the part of what we're going to continue to see is we're going to see new patients entering that funnel. So I don't think there's going to be a slowdown at all. And that's why what we're saying with this backlog, it's not something you're going to see pronounced in any 1 particular quarter or a month, it's going to be something that's going to be a longer-term work down that we're going to see from people kind of funneling through the whole process. So I think you're going to just see that growth rate continue to just be pretty steady and growing. Operator : We now have the final question on the line from Richard Newitter of Truist. Richard Newitter : So just the first one, going back to some of the pricing commentary. I was wondering if you might be willing to comment a bit by tariff setting. The reason I ask, I was trying to think through some areas, perhaps where Stryker's better positioned to take price even than other med tech companies and your potential or your competitive advantage in the ASCs immediately came to mind. I'm just wondering if that's one of the areas where potentially, there might be the possibility of renegotiated contracts, in particular, are going to offer some opportunity there? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, given the inflationary environment, as Preston mentioned earlier, we are obviously going to look at pricing actions across our portfolio. In some places, it's going to be easier than other places given the nature of our contracts. But for competitive reasons, we're really not going to disclose the tactics, the strategies, which products. Every quarter, you see we do report our price, you'll get to see the overall impact, but it's not something we're really -- I'm going to get into on this call. Richard Newitter : Okay. Fair enough. And then just maybe one last one. I think you said you're steering towards the lower end of earnings guidance for earnings per share. And you said that this assumes that at the lower end, at least, assumes that supply chain pressures persist throughout the remainder of the year. But you also said that you expect some improvement as you move into 3Q and 4Q. I just want to make sure I'm reconciling those 2 comments appropriately. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think you're conceptualizing, right? I think what we're trying to communicate is, in the short term, how we saw inflation impacting us in Q1 will feel similar inflation in Q2. We expect the environment to improve, which also means that we also expect to start delivering more of the capital that's been in our order book in Q3 and Q4. Plus, we'll feel the impact of a lesser comparable for one on the top line. And we'll also feel the impact of that sort of back procedural backlog starting to free up, which from a mix standpoint also helps the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. And I would like to hand the call back over to Kevin for some final remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in July. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Mako and Vocera. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 6% with high single-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by endoscopy, instruments and neurocranial. Our hip and knee businesses delivered high single-digit growth in the face of tough compares from 2021. Internationally, we posted high single-digit organic growth with strength in Canada, Europe and Japan as well as double-digit organic growth in emerging markets despite the China COVID-related slowdowns. During the quarter, we continue to have robust demand for our capital products. However, we had meaningful shipment delays as a result of ongoing product supply challenges mostly affecting our large capital businesses. As a reminder, less than 10% of our revenue is large capital, with about 15% of our revenue being smaller operating capital that drives revenue for hospitals. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.25 as we faced increasing negative impacts from foreign exchange as well as inflationary pressures and significant premiums on inventory spot buys. We expect these pressures to continue in the back half of the year. However, the supply situation is improving. Given the higher input costs, we have begun to take a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. These will take time to be reflected in our results given the phasing of contract renewals in many areas of our business. We continue to invest in R&D at a healthy ratio of sales, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med-tech. However, even with disciplined spending, the worsened foreign exchange situation and other pressures will prevent us from delivering leverage to earnings in 2022. With half of the year behind us and a very strong order book, we now expect full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9% and due largely to foreign currency exchange, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency and we are on track for another strong year of sales growth. Our employee engagement remains very high and we continue to win awards as a Great Place to Work, most recently as a Great Place to Work for Millennials by Fortune. We are also gearing up for some exciting new product launches in 2023 and look forward to an improved supply chain picture. Through the many challenges that we had faced since 2020, we feel optimistic about how we are positioning ourselves for the future. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural and geographic trends during the quarter. In addition, I will provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continued to recover throughout the second quarter in most countries. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued, impacting the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely continue, meaning the tailwind of pent-up demand will be more moderate but last longer. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Procedural trends in parts of Asia and Australia have been more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. In addition to the continued procedural recovery, we had a strong quarter of Mako installations, up 19% versus 2021. However, as we are balancing customer purchasing preferences, the mix of these deals has resulted in less revenue per quarter. We are pleased with how the growing installation base continues to fuel market-leading implant growth. The order book remains strong for Mako and the percentage of implants using the robot continues to increase. We will update you on our installations and utilization metrics at the end of the year. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter. While we experienced solid customer order performance from our capital businesses, the sales growth was restricted because of ongoing headwinds, which included raw material shortages, primarily related to electronic components and installation delays in parts of our business due to hospital staffing challenges. The raw material shortages continue to be most impactful in our medical business, both within our acute care and emergency care business units. Based on our current supply outlook, we expect medical to have a strong second half. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the Vocera integration. Since acquiring the company, we have seen double-digit growth in the first and second quarter versus the same periods in 2021. We are already starting to realize synergies and remain excited about the potential this product will create for both Stryker and the customers we serve. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains volatile, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.1% in the quarter. The second quarter\u2019s average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.4%. Foreign currency had a 3% unfavorable impact on sales. Despite a challenging comparable versus 2021, our organic sales growth has been solid and was led by double-digit performances in our Endoscopy and Instruments businesses as well as strong growth in our international businesses. Our sales growth has been somewhat constrained by the continued supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses, primarily in our medical business. Our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers continues to be strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 4.7%. International organic sales growth was 9.7%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in Australia and China. Our adjusted EPS of $2.25 in the quarter was in line with 2021 driven by our sales momentum and favorable adjusted tax rate offset by gross margin challenges and the impact of foreign currency exchange. Our second quarter EPS was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange of $0.05 versus 2021. Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.6%, with organic sales growth of 7.9%, which included 7.2% of U.S. organic growth and 9.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.1%, led by double-digit growth in our orthopedic instruments and surgical technology businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by double-digit growth in power tools, surge account, irrigation, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 15.4%, reflecting very strong performances across all of their portfolio, including video products and double-digit growth of our communications and sports medicine businesses. Medical, which includes our recently acquired Vocera business, had a U.S. organic sales decline of 2.4% driven by the aforementioned supply chain challenges primarily impacting our emergency care products. Medical sage and acute care businesses boosted double-digit organic growth. During the quarter, we also saw significant growth in orders for our beds and emergency care products driven by very strong customer demand. Our U.S. Neurovascular business posted an organic decline of 1.8% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021 as well as competitive pressures, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and softer market conditions in part because of supply shortages of contrast use in procedures. The U.S. neurocranial business posted organic sales growth of 9.4%, which included solid growth in our ENT navigation, balloon dilation and neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 9.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in the endoscopy, neurovascular and neurocranial businesses, somewhat offset by medical. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 3.9% which included organic growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and 9.5% internationally. This reflects the impact of strong international growth and solid growth in our hip, knee and extremity businesses. Our U.S. hips business grew 4.5% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth reflected by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 3.1% organically against a significant comparable in 2021. This growth was led by double-digit growth in our upper extremities, somewhat offset by softness in the trauma market. Our U.S. Spine business declined 3.6% organically, reflecting a slightly slower scoliosis season, partially offset by solid performance in our enabling technology business. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 13.8% primarily driven by the impact related to the aforementioned deal mix changes of Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.5% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia and Korea. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.3% was unfavorable, approximately 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. Compared to 2021, our gross margin was adversely impacted by the purchases of electronic components at premium prices on the spot market and other inflationary pressures, primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as operational efficiencies due to component shortages. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout 2022. We expect Q3 gross margin to be similar to Q2. Q4 should see some improvement and the full year gross margin compared to 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points. Adjusted R&D was 7.2% of sales, which represents a 60 basis point increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to innovation funding and the related future growth that we will provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 32.4% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects continued cost discipline, somewhat offset by the ramping of certain prioritized expenses and hiring that support future growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.7% of sales, which was approximately 220 basis points unfavorable to the second quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary impacts resulting in gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021 primarily resulting from an equity investment gain and favorable interest income. We anticipate a normalized run-rate of adjusted OI&E to be approximately $70 million per quarter for the remainder of 2022. Our second quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.9%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, which is consistent with the ETR performance we experienced in 2021. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.4 billion. Approximately $450 million of debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $732 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying certain other critical raw material inventory. Considering our second quarter results, the strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%. This performance assumes that the market environment experienced in Q2 continues to improve throughout the rest of the year with supply chain disruptions easing in the back half of the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.25 to $0.30 in the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on our performance in the second quarter, including consideration of the continued supply chain challenges and the inflationary environment, together with our increased sales guidance and continued financial discipline, and most significantly, the anticipated future impact related to foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50. The low end of this guidance range assumes that the continued macroeconomic volatility persists, including procedural disruptions and worsening of the electronic component availability. We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and we will provide updates to our guidance as necessary. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Robbie Marcus : Maybe I\u2019d start on second half it\u2019s sort of like a tale of two cities where you have this really strong top line and somewhat of a pressured bottom line. And moving organic sales guidance up 100 basis points is great to see, but it does look like roughly two-thirds of EPS down move is currency a little bit from operations. So maybe just walk us through \u2013 it sounds like medical is going to get a good chunk better in the second half? Maybe just give us a little color of how you get the confidence to raise the top line and where exactly you are seeing the softening operating margin constant currency? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sure, Robbie. This is Kevin. I\u2019ll take that. So first of all, I feel very good about the momentum that we have across all of our businesses. Medical for sure is going to have a much better second half. They were the division that was most affected by the shortages. We do have a line of sight towards the supply of key electronic components and we are going to ramp up as fast as we can to meet that demand. But we also have softer comps. This second quarter was by far the most difficult comparative from the prior year. So we have softer comps across, frankly, all of our businesses in Q3 and Q4. And the order book, not just for Medical, but if I look at the other MedSurg businesses like Instruments and Endoscopy, which both had terrific Q2s, they are going to continue to have strong growth in Q3, Q4. So, we obviously feel very good about the demand from our hospital customers. That gives us the confidence to raise our sales growth. We exited the first half at 7.5%, with a very tough Q2 comp. So, we feel pretty good about getting to the 8% to 9% on the top line. On the bottom line, as you can see, based on the change in our guidance from last quarter, $0.15, if you look at the midpoint of our range, $0.15 of our drop is due to foreign currency. So, that\u2019s the majority of the adjustment on the EPS line. And we are really fighting through significant supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures and right now, obviously, taking it on the chin for our customers at least for this year. But we are taking \u2013 obviously starting to take pricing actions. Those \u2013 we won\u2019t see a lot of that in this year. It will start to roll kind of more into next year. But I\u2019d say the majority of our takedown is due to foreign currency, but obviously, very significant supply chain pressures that we are dealing with, but a very strong demand situation overall. Robbie Marcus : Great. Maybe as a quick follow-up, Kevin or Glenn, I am getting a little greedy here, but I am already looking out to next year. And we have heard from a number of companies that have reported so far to use 2022 as a base year, don\u2019t treat it as a one-time easy comp. And I look at sell-side numbers for next year and it\u2019s about 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. So I know nobody is good enough to forecast next year yet. But if you have any early thoughts on 2023 margins, are you committed to growing margins next year? And just if you have any color on your interpretation of the \u2013 where the sell-side sits right now? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. As you can imagine, a lot has changed in the last 6 months. A lot could change in the next 6 months. And as you know, we always give guidance in January, which we will do. But what I will say is the spot buy situation has been pretty significant. It\u2019s been a big part of our gross margin negative story for this year. That is starting to abate. I would hope that, that gets better next year. But obviously, we will update you in January in terms of the overall outlook. I would not call this year an easy year from the top line comparative. Driving organic growth of 8% to 9% is pretty heavy, but we do have a lot of very exciting launches next year. We have System 9 for power tools, 78 [ph] camera launch, a LIFEPAK defibrillator launch, a Neptune S which is a smaller version of Neptune for GI and ASC. Those are all really outstanding launches. So I do expect that the top line will continue to hum for Stryker next year. The bottom line, like we are going to work through these challenges, and we\u2019ll have more to talk about in January. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the capital environment comments. Kevin, maybe just a little more color on what you are seeing with the large and small capital. And your comments on the Mako deal mix changes. I assume that\u2019s because hospitals are preferring volume-based agreements. So, why do you think that behavior is changing? I mean, I think people on the call might \u2013 that may give people a concern that there is some change in the hospital capital environment? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Larry, first of all, on the Mako side, what I would tell you is this is not a new trend. This has been happening over the past kind of 6 months where we are seeing more deals being financed versus outright purchased and actually a move towards more rental agreements. And if you have a rental agreement, you can\u2019t recognize all the revenue upfront. Even in some of our overall finance deals, we could recognize more of the revenue upfront. In a rental, the customer has the right to return the product. And so you can\u2019t record all of the revenue upfront and that\u2019s what our competitors are also offering. We are not really worried, because we\u2019ve had virtually no returns of our product. Once we get our products in and you can tell by our utilization of Mako, which again, we\u2019ll report on at the end of the year, we have highly utilized machines. And so \u2013 but that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s a shift that\u2019s been ongoing. It wasn\u2019t a new factor this quarter. We are really pleased with the number of installations. But the revenue per unit that we can recognize upfront is lower. And we will be able to recognize more of this revenue over the life of the contracts. And then as it relates to the rest of the capital equipment environment, what I\u2019d tell you is we wouldn\u2019t be taking up our sales if we felt that the capital environment was softening in any way, shape or form. The small capital is needed to be able to do procedures, power tools, wear-out cameras need to be replaced. And the medical business is continuing to get fantastic order growth whether it\u2019s on the defibrillator or power costs as well as our ProCuity bed the orders are continuing to really pour in. We are not seeing hospital construction projects being halted at all. And look at our communications business, which is a large capital business, they had a terrific quarter in the second quarter and their order books continuing to grow. So the timing of construction may get delayed a quarter or so, but no one\u2019s canceling these projects. Nobody is canceling any of our orders. So we\u2019re feeling, at least through the end of this year, feeling pretty bullish about the overall environment. Hospital liquidity is still strong. Now of course, they are feeling pressure on their profits but their liquidity is in a healthy position. And that\u2019s really where the source of funding comes for capital. Lawrence Biegelsen : That\u2019s very helpful. And Glenn thanks for the color on the gross margin. Kind of plugging the numbers into the model, it implies that OpEx growth is, call it, mid-single digits year-over-year in 2022 on a reported basis. I don\u2019t know if my math is right. But how do you do that in an inflationary environment where you\u2019re growing sales 8% to 9% organically? Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Larry, that was quick with the model. A couple of things to keep in mind We are seeing really good performance in our operating expenses, especially SG&A. Single biggest driver in SG&A is really sort of hiring and how prudent are we being about our hiring and the related costs that come along with every time we add a new employee. So we\u2019ve positioned ourselves pretty well relative to that halfway through the year here and feel confident that we will be able to drive sort of meaningful leverage within our SG&A. I mean that being said, we are also mindful that we need to invest in R&D to make sure that we can hit a lot of these key product launches that we\u2019re lined up for, for next year. And then honestly, too, if you move on down the rest of the P&L, I think I kind of gave you a little bit of guidance on OI&E. And we\u2019re also seeing favorable performance in our ETR, which helps at the bottom as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good \u2013 year. Maybe Kevin, one on the guidance here. So the organic was raised by 50 basis points versus the prior guidance. I think the press release had some commentary about the guide raise was based on strong capital orders. Is the guide assuming the capital sales trends to improve in the back half as the supply chain improves? Or are we still looking at perhaps a constrained supply chain environment in the back half? And you did mention implant strength. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the hip strength and you had new product launch in hips. Are we seeing share gains within hips? Kevin Lobo : Well, let me start with the Hips. We\u2019re feeling really great about our Hip business. And as you know, the Insignia launch was \u2013 is a very big launch. It\u2019s not actually even fully launched. So we are still deploying sets out in the field. But the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. And that also is compatible with the Mako robot. The Mako robot utilization for hips is also increasing pretty significantly, which is exciting. That\u2019s due in part to the Hip 4.0 software that we launched, I guess, about two or three quarters ago. That new software, combined with this hip stem, I believe will position us for growing above the market in hips. Not everybody has reported yet. So let\u2019s see how that plays out this quarter. But we\u2019re really only getting started with that stem launch and very excited about the hip business. What was the first part of the question? Vijay Kumar : Capital. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So on the first part of your question was on capital. So clearly, Medical is going to improve in the second half versus their performance. They were down organically in the first half of the year. They are going to be up pretty significantly in the second half of the year because they were the most affected by the shortages of electronics. We still \u2013 even though we\u2019re guiding to this 8% to 9%, that doesn\u2019t assume that we completely bleed everything. We\u2019re still living in a bit of a tough environment out there. And so there is that risk ongoing that might move us towards the lower end of the range or move us up to the higher end of the range. On the implant side, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about procedures are largely back to normal in most parts of the world. And really, it\u2019s about the hospital staffing. If that staffing gets better, then obviously, there is a lot of pent-up demand for procedures. And we\u2019re feeling very good about our position in those businesses. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful comments, Kevin. Maybe one for Glenn here, I think your updated guidance assumes 200 basis points of gross margin impact. I think the prior guide was 100 basis points. That\u2019s almost an incremental, I think if I\u2019m doing the math right, $0.35 to $0.40 impact. Along with FX impact of $0.15, it\u2019s almost incremental $0.50 that Stryker is eating. Are you holding back, Glenn, on the expenses? And is that enough to sustain the 8% to 9% growth? Or maybe just talk about within the P&L, were you comfortable toggling the model, you can still achieve the sales growth metrics? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think a couple of things. First of all, this backlog of orders really gives us a lot of confidence that we have the sales in place to deliver on this increased sales guidance as a baseline. It also implies that we\u2019ve spent a lot of money on the spot buys and electronic components and pre-buying other inventories so that we feel confident and comfortable that we actually have the right sort of supply and raw materials in place to deliver on these few rails. I mean that being said, we are mindful in being a good steward of the operating expenses and not letting that get away from us. I think that\u2019s prudent just given the current environment and given the environment that that we might be heading into. And so we haven\u2019t really taken our foot off of that pedal in terms of controlling that at all for the whole year. And so I don\u2019t expect that, that will change in the back half of the year. If you look at like sales force hiring, it almost universally occurs for the most part, in literally the first month of the year for every single division. They fill out their sales forces at that point in time. So I don\u2019t feel like there is a big gap that I\u2019m staring down that can\u2019t really deliver on the sales growth. I think the name of the game is really going to be delivering for our customers these finished products based on what we have in our supply chain and what we currently have in inventories. And that\u2019s going to really drive that sales growth number. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice execution, pretty tough markets. You\u2019ve been pretty crystal clear on this call that CapEx demand remains very robust. But a lot of large not-for-profit health systems have a September 30 year-end. And because the margin pressure you\u2019re facing hospitals due to labor. We\u2019ve heard some discussions around CapEx reductions beginning with our fiscal \u201823 budgets, which began in the fourth quarter. So do you assume any changes of the macro CapEx environment when hospitals update their CapEx plans for this calendar fourth quarter? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Right now, we\u2019re not baking in any major changes. Certainly, if you look at prior situations where hospitals were under fire, we really didn\u2019t see much of an impact at all in the small capital area. The one area you could see some impact would be in the larger capital. But of course, a lot of our business, we do have financing through Stryker Flex Financial, which does help with offsetting the kind of pressures that the hospital has in terms of overall capital. And as I mentioned earlier, coming out of the \u2013 out of 2020 with CARES Act funding, liquidity of hospitals is actually pretty good right now. So with our portfolio mix, I think we\u2019re in good shape. If you think about something like Mako, it\u2019s still early in the cycle and hospitals are really anxious to get that product. It\u2019s not like they have old Makos that they are trying to upgrade and change. They are looking at increasing adoption early in the cycle. So I think our portfolio lends itself very well to what hospitals need. And they are going to prioritize our capital and potentially not prioritize other people\u2019s capital. You could say that\u2019s an optimistic outlook but just the way orders are continuing to stream in. And we haven\u2019t had really any orders canceled. And we don\u2019t have a history of that in our company. So do I have great visibility into the second half of next year? No. Do I have really good visibility through the end of this year and probably into the early part of next year? Yes, I think we do. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. On the same topic of hospitals under pressure just from labor, you talk to us getting some price increases versus normal decreases. I\u2019m just curious \u2013 and I do understand it takes time for contracts to sort of roll off. But are you seeing any RFP sort of today or in the last sort of few months, which is showing confidence that hospitals are willing to absorb these price increases to offset your increased inflationary pressures? Thanks so much. Jason Beach : Yes. Peter, it\u2019s Jason. So I\u2019d say a couple of things. I mean we\u2019re not, for competitive reasons, going to get into the various tactics around pricing and those things. But I will say we see some shoots of confidence, if you will, in terms of customers willing to take price. And they understand the environment that we\u2019re working in, right? So it\u2019s going to look, to your point, very different depending on the business that we\u2019re talking to. On the implant side, you\u2019ve got the contract cycles and some of those things. But then there is also the MedSurg side that has historically gotten price, right? And we continue to expect that we will as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Kevin, thanks for taking the questions. I think this question for Glenn. Glenn, you\u2019ve got a bunch of different acute situations happening right now with FX and wages going up in raw materials and freight. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going to carry a lot of those extra costs throughout this year. But do you think we can start to see \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see easing of some of those things right now. We can start to see somewhat of a snapback in the first half of next year in earnings or just given your inventory levels and cost structure, is it something that\u2019s likely going to persist into the first half of next year and maybe get better or more like second half of next year on the earnings side? Glenn Boehnlein : Okay, Matt. Without giving 2023 guidance, what I will say is the spot buy and the chip situation in the electronic component situation, we are seeing some easing of that. And we are seeing examples of where we are going to our regular suppliers and they are supplying us these components based on our negotiated contract pricing. So we\u2019re not necessarily having the only spot markets for everything. That being said, some of these other costs that are really driven by inflation and they are commodity oriented for metals, for plastics, for transportation, some of those, I think, are going to linger for a while for sure. And I would expect to see those bleed into next year, certainly the first half of next year. But I am hopeful that the spot by kind of premium things that we have experienced pretty severely in this quarter and in Q1, we will actually start to bag. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then the Instruments and Endoscopy numbers were really strong. I would just love to hear about durability of that \u2013 of those products are not the most sexy products, I guess, for lack of a better term, I guess, across med-tech. So just talk about the durability there. And then Kevin, I think you said last quarter that Neurovascular had some competitive pressures in ischemic. Is that still the case today? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Yes. First of all, I actually think Instruments and Endoscopy are pretty sexy businesses. But really, this is really about having terrific products. Our power tools are market-leading. Our flight helmets are market-leading. Procedures are picking up. And if procedures pick up, every time you do an orthopedic procedure using our flight helmet, you\u2019re using our \u2013 if you\u2019re using cement, you\u2019re using our cement mixers. You\u2019re using our power tools in the general surgery area. You\u2019re using our cameras. They go through the autoclave and then they break down and then they have got to be replaced. And so we have obviously the leading imaging system. And so \u2013 and our sports medicine business has just been on fire, right? It\u2019s growing strong double digits. And our ASC offense, we had a fabulous second quarter in ASC. We have a couple of new shoulder products with our in-space balloon as well as our ALF [ph] event peak anchors. And so we have a lot of strength across those two businesses. And they always have been kind of consistent growers for Stryker, if you go back over the last 15 years. And so they are going to continue their momentum. They have a really great engine of R&D and new products and power tools and cameras have new launches coming up next year. So I think it\u2019s absolutely \u2013 they are absolutely durable. What was the second part, sorry? Matthew O\u2019Brien: NV. Kevin Lobo : NV. Yes. So Neurovascular, look, the market has been a bit soft in the U.S. Just keep in mind, the U.S. is certainly smaller in NV. They actually have more of their sales outside of the United States. It\u2019s a little different than the rest of the Stryker portfolio. But the market has been a bit softer. And on the aspiration side, there have been a lot of competitive entrants in the United States. A lot of new aspiration products, which when the new products are launched, it does take surgeon attention. They want to try them out. And so there is been a bit of a factor there that has touched that business. But overall, I still feel very good about the Neurovascular business. It\u2019s still going to \u2013 we\u2019re still treating just a small fraction of the patients that need to be served. And over time, we\u2019re sure that, that business will pick up, not just outside the U.S. but also inside the U.S. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment, both the headwinds that you experienced in the quarter. And then it sounds like you\u2019re going contract by contract and trying to right fly some of that to reflect inflation. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think \u2013 hi, Joanne, in terms of Q2, we did experience some of the pricing difficulties that you felt in the pricing number, the 1.4% negative that we disclosed. I will say that that\u2019s pretty consistent with the range that we feel in normal years. I do think that we have a very big focus with our sales teams on pricing and with our customers. And we actually saw positive pricing performance related to our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotechnology business, which is a good indicator that we are starting to enter these conversations with our customers. Our customers are doing their diligence. They understand that just with their staffing, with their nursing that prices are going up and that\u2019s impacting us, too. And so we are having the conversations. Although given the contracting nature of some of our business, it just takes time for some of these things to stick. And so I do think that we are beginning to really lay the groundwork to really impact pricing over the future well into next year. And so I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re laying the processes in place now to make sure that we work with our customers to implement price increases. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And keep in mind, Joanne, like some of the contracts have rebate clauses. And so you see those rebates do show up in our price number and that\u2019s a bit of a lag effect, right? So they earn the rebate and then the rebate flows through. So that\u2019s another part of this timing issue where it will take time for this to show up even as we negotiate higher prices for our products. Joanne Wuensch : I appreciate that clarification. As a second question, are some of the pipeline products, maybe even for next year, including other applications of the robot, maybe finally shoulder or spine? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Joanne, could you repeat that for us? Sorry, we had a little trouble here. Joanne Wuensch : Sure. No problem. The question has to do with your pipeline products and the timing of other applications for robots for applications such as spine and/or shoulder applications. Jason Beach : Yes. Joanne, it\u2019s Jason. So at this point, we don\u2019t have anything further to announce. Obviously, as we get closer to launch timing, we will do that but nothing further at this point. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The one thing I\u2019d tell you is the Spine team is pretty excited about. But just separate for Mako, Joanne, I would say the Spine team is pretty excited about Q guidance, which received approval. Okay. It\u2019s not a full robotic solution but it is a pretty exciting offering within enabling technologies. We now have the spinal application approved and the cranial application is sitting with the FDA. But that should give them a bit of a lift in the second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joshua Jennings with Cowen. Please proceed. Joshua Jennings : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Kevin, I was hoping to just ask about staffing shortages and impact on the implant business. I think they kind of felt that they may have peaked during the Omicron surge. And absenteeism contributed to the staffing shortage pressuring like procedure volumes. But do you feel \u2013 and it\u2019s probably hard to quantify that staffing shortage have improved gradually over the last few months? Or are we \u2013 has that kind of stalled? And are you expecting within your updated organic revenue guidance that staffing shortages will improve? It sounded like one of your previous answers that that wasn\u2019t the case but just wanted to clarify that. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Certainly, we saw choppiness in the second quarter. That\u2019s kind of the word I would use. And it could be related to staffing challenges just hiring staff and having consistent staff that actually know the procedure, so you can do the same number of procedures that you used to do in a day and COVID, which affected, frankly, some of the nurses as well as patients who had to delay their procedure because they got contracted COVID. So that type of choppiness is actually still lingering right now as we speak. But we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick in procedural volumes, and we do expect that uptick to gradual proof we\u2019re not calling for a giant spike. But we are calling for this kind of environment to continue and see gradual improvement from where we were in the second quarter through the rest of the year. Joshua Jennings : Understood. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up on just the Spine business and I know there was some scolio softness. It sounds like Glenn called out. Is there anything to highlight just with the market recovery in spine relative to other ortho procedure categories? Or do you think the 2Q performance was more Stryker-specific? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Jason Beach : Yes. It\u2019s Jason. I don\u2019t think at this point there is anything more to highlight. I mean obviously, we\u2019re early in the earnings cycle as well. So tough to tell how we compare the rest of market but I\u2019d say nothing else to add at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Please proceed. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the Mako dynamics. And you talked about some different ordering patterns. Is that more indicative of maybe going into competitive accounts where you haven\u2019t been historically and they want to rent before they fully commit? And then I do have a follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re showing up anywhere differently. It\u2019s just that if your competitor offers a rental option, the customer says do you have a rental option. And so the idea is look, we\u2019re not going to let our prior contracting approach stop us from competing. And so we\u2019ve introduced a rental option and started to promote that, just to make sure that that\u2019s not one of the barriers and that let the technologies fight head-to-head and let the best technology win. So it\u2019s more of a response to what has been happening in the marketplace, not so much that we\u2019re going into different accounts. We\u2019ve always been active in competitive accounts as well as active in \u2013 with surgeons that use Stryker products. We\u2019re really pretty agnostic. Whoever wants to use robotics, we want to make sure that if we show up and that they are able to try our technologies, and we believe we have the best system in the market. Kyle Rose : Great. And then historically, you\u2019ve talked about trends in the ASC market and putting together one sales team into the ASC. Maybe just touch on what trends you\u2019re seeing in the ASC and how that focused sales approach is playing out commercially? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, I\u2019m really excited about our success in the ASC market. One of the ways you can gauge that is just our sports medicine business, which is normally involved in those deals and has been a big beneficiary of the overall Stryker offense and also Mako. So with the Mako, sales in the ASC has continued to increase. So if you look at the percentage of Makos and ASCs versus hospitals, that ratio has been gradually increasing. It increased again in the second quarter. So the ASC is a place that Stryker can really play well given that we\u2019re so deep in the orthopedic service line with capital equipment as well as implants and disposables. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Chris Pasquale : Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two here upfront. First, if you could just go into some more detail on what\u2019s holding back trauma whether that\u2019s a product portfolio issue or a market issue, that would be great. And then Kevin, you mentioned a couple of times being excited about the pipeline. I wanted to just highlight maybe two or three products that you guys have coming in the next 6 to 12 months that we should be paying attention to? Kevin Lobo : Yes. First of all, I think there is nothing holding back our trauma business. I would tell you that we had a massive comp from the prior year, if you go back to the prior year second quarter, we had pretty massive comparative. We have a great train business, whether it\u2019s the upper extremities business, which grew double digits again and we will continue to grow double digits for the rest of the year. I think Foot & Ankle, the total ankle had another really strong quarter in the second quarter. It was a little bit soft on the sort of the 4-foot procedures. And then the overall sort of underlying core trauma business, the market was a little bit softer that happens from quarter-to-quarter, right? So whether it\u2019s weather, whether it\u2019s who knows what, it\u2019s not unusual. But I have zero worries about our Trauma and Extremities business. We are widely excited about the way right medical is integrated into our business. And we have a business, as you\u2019ve seen over the past 5 years, that performs very, very well. And so there is nothing holding that business back. I\u2019m pretty bullish on that business for the future. Was there a second part? Chris Pasquale : Pipeline. Kevin Lobo : Product pipeline, I think I mentioned before that we are really entering a pretty exciting period going into next year with System 9 and next-generation power tools, 78 camera, the next-generation camera life pack defibrillator, which is the big sort of the big, large complex defibrillator and then the Neptune AS [ph], which is a smaller version of Neptune that will get us into procedure areas that not currently in today, especially GI, which is a very, very high volume procedure. An amazing feature of this product is the ability to be able to capture the polyp. And if you have to watch what they have to do today to find polyps within the waste that they have to sort through, it\u2019s not very pretty. And this is a very, very elegant solution with this innovation. And so something we are very excited about being able to launch. It will get us, frankly, into brand new markets where we don\u2019t even play today. So, those are some of the launches, I am sure I am missing a few from some of the other divisions. But those are big launches. And as you know, when we launch those big \u2013 when we have these big launches, they really do drive growth than they had historically. Chris Pasquale : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Steve Lichtman : Thank you. Hi, guys. Glenn, on the increased headwind you are building in for inflation this year, I was wondering versus your assumptions on the 1Q call where the biggest deltas were. Was it the persistence of spot buying at elevated prices that maybe are going on longer? Is it higher base assumption on input and labor costs? Just wondering if one stood out or if it was just across the board? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think probably the single biggest thing was the spot buy and the premiums. I think as we entered into Q2 and exited Q1, we saw that, that was happening. But who could imagine the demand that was out there relative to us competing with car companies and a whole bunch of different kind of competitors that we never really had before with those vendors. And so, I would say that those premiums that we paid just so that we could make sure that we were serving our customers and could deliver them products were the single biggest thing that maybe changed from guidance last time to guidance this time. I think the other though persistent thing that we are seeing is just because the supply chain has been so spotty, we also are just \u2013 we are feeling inefficiencies in our processes and how we manage our manufacturing across the globe with sort of inconsistencies of when we will have raw materials available for teams to work on. So, I do say it\u2019s probably spot buys is the one big thing that really sticks out. But a lot of these little nits on inflation are also impacting us as well. Steve Lichtman : Got it. And then just secondly, on China, I know obviously not a big business for you and you grew emerging markets solidly in the quarter. But just wondering what you saw there specifically in the second quarter? And any easing of pressures in China as we exited the quarter? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, China, it was a tough quarter, and I think anybody you talk to would say that just given the lockdowns and all the challenges. So, we certainly had negative growth in China in the quarter. But our other emerging markets were pretty fantastic. And that growth was able to offset the negative that we had in China. It\u2019s looking like it\u2019s starting to get better. But we didn\u2019t fare, I don\u2019t think any better than our competitors. It was definitely a tough quarter Q2 in China. We do have some businesses that were \u2013 like our neurovascular business continue to do very well in China. They were a little less impacted, just the nature of that type of procedure. But the rest of our businesses felt the same pressure as everybody else. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rich Newitter with Truist. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little historical perspective on the capital spending situation. We are all looking forward and the prospect of recession is obviously there. At what point historically for your capital mix of businesses have you seen \u2013 what have you seen as the leading indicator for when replacement cycles do, in fact, elongate? Clearly, you are not seeing it yet, but is there a point at which we should be braced for that happening? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think, look, the recession would have to be pretty prolonged. We always have a delayed reaction across our portfolio, whether it\u2019s more elective procedures or whether it\u2019s capital equipment. We tend to get affected much later in the cycle versus other parts of the healthcare system. So, it would have to be prolonged, which I think the economists for now are not really calling for kind of a prolonged recession. The other factor is really hospital liquidity. That\u2019s a big factor. So, if you go back to the financial meltdown, it wasn\u2019t just that there was a recession, right? There was a liquidity crisis. And when that happens, that\u2019s when you see \u2013 you saw our medical business, the large capital business, really get impacted. But we don\u2019t see a liquidity crisis today. The hospital balance sheets are actually quite strong. So, that gives us some confidence. And plus, look, Stryker is a different company than it was back in the financial meltdown. Large capital is a big part of our company. We have diversified dramatically in the past decade, so much so that it\u2019s less than 10% of our overall sales. So, even if there was an impact, it\u2019s certainly not going to hurt us anywhere near the way it would have hurt us a decade ago. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe just one more on Mako, like big-ticket capital, it sounds like the message was there was no real change in buying or demand for robotic reprioritization of hip and knee, Mako robotics, per se. But maybe there was just some revenue mix and some changes in the revenue recognition. Is that right that the actual in-quarter demand, not just the order book, but the in-quarter demand for Mako was pretty much unchanged and strong? Kevin Lobo : Yes, it was strong. I mean I think Jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, it was \u2013 we were up 19% versus the prior year. Now a good part of that was international. But even in the U.S., we had growth versus the prior year. And that\u2019s actually starting to pick up in the U.S. So, demand is very strong. So, you have to remember where we are in the cycle of robotics, right. We are in the early stages, in the early cycle of robotic surgery adoption. And I think if we were in a later cycle might be a bit different story. But because it\u2019s robotics, it\u2019s still early. There are still people who are anxious to get their hands on robots. And we are now very active in all the teaching hospitals. And the residents are coming out and they want a robot. And when they go into their new facility and the facility doesn\u2019t have a robot, they put a lot of pressure on their hospital to adopt it. Now how they choose to pay for it, what type of contracting arrangements to get into, that\u2019s a whole other story. But facilities are buying their fourth and their fifth and their sixth robots. And so they are doing that because they absolutely believe in the value of robotics. That has nothing to do with marketing. It\u2019s all about really trying to provide best value for their customers and for their patients. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please proceed. Travis Steed : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I would love a little bit more clarification on the 200 basis point margin headwind you called out. How much of that is actually coming from some of the more acute spot buying that you mentioned versus the other inflationary things like plastics, metals and travel? Is it roughly half and half, or is it 75-25? Just any directional color would be helpful. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Sure. I think as you look at sort of that basket of cost, the spot buy certainly are significant, maybe approaching half of that basket of costs. I mean that being said, keep in mind that as we made those spot buy purchases, the underlying inventory goes on the balance sheet. And then it bleeds out into our P&L over the utilization period. So, it\u2019s not something that goes away from us in the short-term. The other basket of costs, though, we do feel that inflation. We feel it in labor. We feel it in transportation. We are seeing it in commodities. And that\u2019s something that I am not necessarily expecting will necessarily go away for us over the longer term. Travis Steed : No, that\u2019s really helpful as we kind of think about our models for the next year. So, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess on pricing, do you think you could see it going flattish next year, or could it be something that goes positive? And then I don\u2019t know if you have any other quick comments on the sports medicine market and smoke evacuation, that would be helpful as well. Appreciate it. Thank you. Jason Beach : Yes. Travis, it\u2019s Jason. Just really quickly on the pricing piece, and then I will hand it over to Glenn on the sports med. But relative to guiding on price, we are not going to guide on price for next year. And when we get closer to 2023 earnings season, you will hear more, but nothing to guide there. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. On your question on Smoke Evac and sports medicine, first of all, Smoke Evac continues to be very high growth. There are six states that are mandating smoke-free ORs. There are seven other states that have legislation that\u2019s pending. And so you can see the momentum around smoke-free operating rooms is absolutely increasing. And we are in a great position and we had fantastic growth in smoke evacuation. That should continue. And then on Sports Med, this is about our company and we are now becoming \u2013 we are fast becoming a leader in sports medicine, which obviously wasn\u2019t the case a decade ago. First, we started off with our hip portfolio with the Pivot acquisition and some \u2013 and really becoming the leader in hip arthroscopy. We already had a decent knee offering. And shoulder had been our weakness, and we have really bolstered our shoulder portfolio. So, in all the key areas, we now have very compelling product opportunities. And when we are absolutely growing faster than the market and have been for the last couple of years. But I think the ASC shift has put an accelerator on our sports medicine business. And I think you know that sits within our Endoscopy division. But that business has a fabulous outlook for the future. I mentioned the in-space balloon for massive rotator cuff repair. The [indiscernible] product has just recently launched, which really addresses gaps that we had in the sort of smaller rotator cuff repair part of the sports medicine business. So, I am extremely bullish about sports medicine for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Drew Ranieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, just to go back to one of your comments about the trauma market. And I think specifically it was on foot and ankle. You mentioned there was some softness on forefoot procedures. Just curious if that was the overall market or if there is anything else that you were seeing there. And then second, just on ProCuity, you have talked about it being just a strong launch. Curious kind of what you are thinking in terms of the durability there. And are you taking competitive share, or is it really growth really all driven by replacements at this point? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, the orders are continuing to pile up on ProCuity and it\u2019s not just in friendly shops. So, we are clearly winning competitive business. This is an absolutely fantastic product. The thing we have is there are a lot of microchips used in that product. And so we are being constrained on being able to ship to meet the demand. That is going to get better in the second half and into next year. But it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s a terrific product. And that\u2019s going to continue to drive growth. It\u2019s kind of year two of the product launch and if we weren\u2019t so supply constrained, we would be shipping a lot more of those products. But beds don\u2019t sort of ramp as quickly in terms of the buying cycle as a power tool or as a camera. So, I would expect the next let\u2019s call it, 2 years to be really, really strong for ProCuity. And what was the second thing? On foot and ankle, look, we will have to see what happens when everybody else reports and kind of see what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. It was a little bit softer for us on the forefoot side, but strong on the total ankle side. And let\u2019s just \u2013 we will have to see how that plays out. I really \u2013 it\u2019s a little premature to know kind of how we are doing. I would say we are pretty excited about \u2013 we have a number of fore-foot launches. We had some supply challenges in getting those launches activated. But like the easy foot [ph] launch, for example, or easy as we call it, sorry, it looks like a staple. Terrific product for procedures. But we stumbled a little bit in \u2013 just because of supply chain challenges in getting these new launches for MIS forefoot. Those launches will \u2013 I just mentioned one of those is EasyFuse. But there is about five of these products which we will start to see the impact of those in the second half of the year. So, I am feeling optimistic going forward, but the second quarter was a little bit choppy. Nothing that\u2019s overly concerning. Drew Ranieri : Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Matson with Needham & Company. Please proceed. Michael Matson : Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. Just had two questions, I guess I will just go ahead and give them to you both to you here. So, the \u2013 with the System 9 and the 17 EDA coming up next year, is there any risk that we are going to see a slowdown in those businesses? I know how important those product lines are to instruments in endoscopy. And then the second question would just be around R&D. It\u2019s 7.2% in the first half. Looking back at my model, that\u2019s up almost 200 basis points over the past 10 years. Is this the new normal, or could it keep going higher from here? Kevin Lobo : Well, let me start with the product launches. When we do these new launches, we have sales forces that know how to kind of drive revenue. And these are products that do wear out and do need to be replaced. And so I am not expecting any slowdown whatsoever. If anything, you should see growth continue and then gradually increase. And sometimes, it\u2019s not the first year that you see the spike. You sort of see it, but you certainly see it by the second year. So, to me this is just a continuation of \u2013 it will continue a very, very good trend. Look, R&D has gone up and part of it\u2019s because of the mix of our businesses. If you think about neurovascular, it\u2019s a little more thirsty because of the clinicals that are required. We are launching a lot of new products. So, our spend has increased. And look, we were over 7% of sales, I think for the full year. I don\u2019t know that we will stay over 7% but we will be kind of in that neighborhood as a percentage of sales. I don\u2019t know that it goes a lot higher from here. I think that\u2019s a pretty healthy level of R&D. But look, that fuels our growth and growth doesn\u2019t come for free. So, you do have to invest in innovation if you want to continue to grow. But I think this is probably a good level. And we will kind of stay at this level unless our portfolio drastically changes. We are doing more in the world of digital. That does cost some money, make over pursuing different applications. That is a bit first for R&D. But I would say that this is a pretty good level. Michael Matson : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please proceed. Jeff Johnson : Hi guys. Good afternoon. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions. First, on pricing. You sound pretty good on pricing going forward. Is that largely driven by the strong new product cycle coming in MedSurg and you typically can get a little price on new MedSurg products, or do you \u2013 would you expect in MedSurg to take bigger than normal price increases on these new products? And then on the implant side, have you had any tangible conversations with hospitals yet about maybe less bad pricing dynamics in contracts over the next couple of years, or is that just still a hope at this point but nothing tangible yet to talk about? Kevin Lobo : Yes. On the first question, I want to be really clear here that whenever we do launch new products, whatever price \u2013 we normally will raise the price. But you won\u2019t see that in the price line of our quarterly results. So, price the way we report price is like-for-like. So, as the System 9, if it comes in at a higher price for the first year, that will show up in mix and volume, it will not show up in the price line. So, in the second year, that like-for-like will start to show up. So, just to be clear about that, we always \u2013 ProCuity is a good example. The ProCuity price is higher than our beds. But in the first year of that launch, you don\u2019t see that showing up in the price line. It shows up in volume mix. So, I hope I am clear on that. But obviously, that\u2019s going to be part of our strategy. As we launch new products, we are going to be able to raise prices. As it relates to implants, early days yet. We have had a couple of early conversations and they have gone reasonably well. But it is way too early for me to be able to give you a sign of what is going to come in the future and we will have more to share on future calls. Jeff Johnson : Alright. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more on gross margins, just kind of it\u2019s about 100 basis points headwind is on the spot buy, heightened costs this year on that. If those spot prices do come down over the next six months as it seems like you think they could, is that 30 days to 60 days to work that into the product and turn that over onto the P&L? So, that tends to be a short cycle, those benefits could show up quickly? And then maybe on the implant side, where that is getting capitalized to the balance sheet right now, those higher costs. Is there a significantly greater headwind next year, another 100 basis points that\u2019s being capitalized on to the balance sheet right now that hasn\u2019t yet come through this year. So, we have to think maybe an incremental 100 basis point headwind there, that could get offset by the short cycle spot by pricing coming down next year and net-net, those could offset, or just conceptually, maybe how do we think about those two moving parts? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Without getting too granular about next year, the way these bleed out, it\u2019s not necessarily short-term in terms of how they bleed out. We worked pretty diligently to secure the kind of supply that was available when we could get it. And so that has a longer tail in terms of when we will feel the bleed out into our P&L. And that would apply to either side implants or the MedSurg businesses. Jeff Johnson : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Please proceed. Shagun Singh : Thank you for taking the question. I will just keep it to one. Just on M&A, how are you thinking about the current M&A environment? Your appetite for deals at the moment given valuations where they are, are you more or less likely to do one? And do you \u2013 should we expect you to continue to focus on tuck-ins versus larger deals given the recent Vocera acquisition? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. Certainly, we are focused on tuck-ins, not just given Vocera, but also Wright Medical. So, we did Wright Medical not so long ago. And then we did Vocera. As Glenn mentioned, we paid $450 million of debt down in the last quarter. So, right now, given our balance sheet situation, our focus is really on tuck-ins. All of our businesses are actively pursuing these kind of tuck-ins. But you should expect that that\u2019s kind of in our near-term, let\u2019s say, through the end of this year. Our focus will be much more on the tuck-ins. And obviously, valuations are down. That doesn\u2019t mean that the companies that have these lower valuations are excited to sell at these new values. I think it\u2019s going to take a little time for that to set in before we are going to see a lot of those companies want to sell. So, I don\u2019t think that we are going to miss a window, so to speak, just because we are focused on the tuck-ins. But we do need to digest the acquisitions. We do need to fortify our balance sheet, but we will continue to pursue tuck-ins. Operator : Thank you. The last question is from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. I will try and be quick on my questions. Number one, just I want to ask the pricing question in a different way. And as they think about price and the ability to take it, I mean I know you are not going to give us what kind of pricing is going to take. But how do you think about inflation? And what persists over the next six months or into next year in terms of how much that you can carry through? So, inflation versus an 8% is a reasonable thing we can push through a similar type price increase into next year? And then the follow-up question is just around Mako dynamics and the shift to either a rent or a lease type model. We see with Intuitive 40%-plus in the last quarter. Is that the right level to think about for where this shakes out and settles out in terms of Mako adoption and the business model? Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Hey Ryan, I will handle the pricing/inflation one first. I do think some of the normal things that you think about relative to the inflationary environment we are in and we are feeling will persist and will live on into next year. We see labor increases. We see increases in these commodities. I do think it will take a while before transportation and freight settles down to a more, what I will call normal cadence in terms of ocean freight versus air freight. And so I think that will take a while to settle out. And in fact, where we enter into conversations with our customers about sort of what our cost makeup looks like, and we are very frank with them. There are no surprises to them in terms of where we are seeing real increase in the real kind of raw materials and components that go into our products. And those are the kind of discussions that customers may not want to have, but they know and they expect it\u2019s coming. And so when we lead to go after price, we lead with details and with information so that they understand that underneath our pricing increase, we are feeling real increases in the components that go into our products. Jason Beach : Ryan, it\u2019s Jason. In terms of the Mako question, I guess what I would say is in terms of the right mix, I think what\u2019s important here is we think about the different options. We are trying to be flexible with the customer to ultimately drive the installed base to then get to continue market-leading growth on the implant side, right. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s important for us and less about kind of that mix as we think about finance, direct purchase, etcetera. So, we are excited where we are headed with Mako. As I said in my opening remarks of the 19% install increase year-on-year. And so I will just kind of leave it there as we are thinking about Mako. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Great. Well, thank you all for joining our call, and thank you for all your questions. We look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you in October. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly and comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and updates on Vocera and capital equipment. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. For the quarter, organic sales growth was 10% with double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses led by Endoscopy, Medical and Neurocranial. Our Hip and Knee businesses also delivered double-digit growth, reflecting the continued recovery of elective procedures and our worldwide Mako momentum. Lastly, we continued our strong international performance with double-digit organic growth led by Europe, Canada and emerging markets despite negative growth in China. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.12 a share driven by our strong sales performance, partially offsetting negative foreign currency and inflationary pressures. We expect these pressures to continue but at a more moderate level for the remainder of 2022. We are pleased with our strong sales growth, which would have been even higher if not for material shortages, mostly affecting Medical and Instruments. Meanwhile, we are taking actions to deal with the cost headwinds, including inflationary challenges. First, as noted in Q2, given the higher input costs, we took a series of pricing actions across our portfolio. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives, lessening the negative price impact on our business in Q3, but it will take time to see the full effect given the timing of contract renewals and rebates from pirate contracts expiring.  Second, we have taken additional actions around cost, including the reduction of discretionary items, hiring actions and are proceeding with target restructuring plans in parts of our business. We continue to invest in R&D, demonstrating our continued focus on new product pipelines. This includes investments in R&D for enabling technologies, robotics, imaging and navigation, including our recently launched Q Guidance navigation system in Spine. Notably, we are making good progress with the development of our spine and shoulder applications for Mako. We have stopped the Cardan spine robotic project to focus all our energies on Mako and expect that the Mako spine and shoulder launches will occur in a similar time frame. Also during the quarter, we signed an agreement to purchase Cerus Endovascular, a technology leader in the hemorrhagic segment. This deal is pending customary closing conditions. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our narrowing of full year organic sales growth to the higher end of our prior range, now 8.5% to 9%. However, worsening foreign currency and continued inflationary pressures have caused us to lower our full year adjusted EPS range to $9.15 to $9.25 per share. Overall, our team has shown good resiliency, and I'm pleased that employee engagement remains very high. We continue to be recognized across many countries, professions, gender and age groups as a great place to work, most recently as one of the world's best workplaces by Fortune. As we look ahead to 2023, we feel optimistic about growth with high customer demand and exciting new product launches. Though the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges will continue to impact next year, the strong growth outlook, combined with our pricing and cost actions, will position us well to return to strong earnings growth.  I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, including the procedural, geographic and capital trends during the quarter. In addition, I'll provide an update on the integration progress of the Vocera business. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the third quarter in most countries, and we are beginning to reach normalized levels across most of our business. While we are seeing volumes recover, hospital staffing pressures have continued to impact the ability to reduce procedural backlog in a meaningful way. These challenges will likely resolve gradually, and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind into next year. Geographically, procedural volumes steadily improved during the quarter in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Parts of Asia Pacific have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. Demand for our capital products remained very strong in the quarter as seen from the double-digit growth of our Medical division. However, we did realize some installation delays as well as hospital scheduling challenges. Specific to Mako, installations for the quarter were soft as we realized delays stemming from variability in the hospital environment. However, our order book remains strong, and we expect a good fourth quarter for Mako. We will update you on our key Mako metrics in January. Now to our key integration activities. We continue to be pleased with our Vocera integration progress and remain excited about the strong growth potential of this platform technology. However, in Q3, we elected to delay some installations shifting from on-prem servers to our cloud solution with certain customers. Also, as we do with all acquisitions, we are shifting the legacy sales force to the Stryker model, which has caused some disruption. These delays resulted in revenues that were essentially flat to Q3 2021. However, the order pipeline remains strong and customer retention remains very high at 99% for software renewals. We expect these processes to continue into Q1 of next year, after which we will be positioned to drive robust sales growth. In summary, while the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, procedural volumes are improving and the underlying demand for our products remain strong, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.9% in the quarter. The third quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 0.7%. We have started to see the positive impact of pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all had positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.7% unfavorable impact on sales. We continue to experience supply chain disruptions that have increased costs and led to inconsistent product availability. This is especially impacting the shipping and delivery time lines related to capital products in our MedSurg businesses. Nevertheless, our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remained strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.2%. International organic sales growth was 11.8%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, specifically emerging markets, Canada, Japan and Europe, somewhat offset by lingering COVID impacts in other Asia Pac countries. Our adjusted EPS of $2.12 in the quarter was down $0.08 from 2021 due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.08. Additionally, higher costs associated with gross margin challenges were offset by the benefit from higher sales and cost discipline.  Now I'll provide some highlights around our segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.5% with organic sales growth of 10.8%, which included 9.6% of U.S. organic growth and 14.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.2% led by our Surgical Technology business.  From a product perspective, sales growth was highlighted by growth in smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. During the quarter, Instruments experienced supply chain challenges primarily related to its capital products. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 14% highlighted by double-digit growth in both the core Endoscopy and Sports Medicine businesses. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.7% driven by growth in our Sage and acute care businesses fueled by ProCuity and Prime structure demand. As previously noted, Medical continues to experience supply chain challenges that primarily impact emergency care products. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had an organic decline of 2% driven by a strong double-digit comparable in 2021, disruptions due to hospital staffing shortages and slower clinic volumes as well as competitive pressures. The U.S. neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 12.7%, which included solid growth in our Max space and Neuro products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 14.4%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Japan, China and other emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8.7%, which included organic growth of 8.7% in the U.S. and 8.9% internationally. This reflects the impact of our strong international growth and solid growth in our Hip, Knee and Trauma and Extremities businesses. Our U.S. Hip business grew 12.4% organically, reflecting strong primary Hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. New York Knee business grew 14% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.4% organically with strong performances across all 4 businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities highlighted by our new products Perform and BLUEPRINT. Our U.S. Spine business sales grew 2% from solid performance in our enabling technology business, somewhat offset by the impact of lower surgery volumes in the competitive environment. Our U.S. Other ortho declined organically by 11.2% primarily driven by the impact of the aforementioned delays in Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 8.9% organically, which reflects the strong momentum in Europe as procedural volumes improve as well as strong performances in Japan, Canada and India, somewhat offset by COVID-related volatility in Australia. Now I will focus on the operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.6% was unfavorable approximately 370 basis points from the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as inefficiencies from supply chain disruption and the unfavorable impact of price and foreign exchange on sales. Sequentially, from Q2 2022, gross margin was 70 basis points unfavorable. This included the impact from unfavorable business mix, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, including premium pricing and operational inefficiencies. We expect these adverse impacts to continue throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023. For the full year 2022, we now expect adjusted gross margin compared to 2021 to be adversely impacted by approximately 250 basis points. Adjusted R&D spending was 7.1% of sales, which represents a 40 basis points increase from 2021. This reflects our continued commitment to funding innovation and the related future growth that we'll provide. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 100 basis points lower than 2021. This reflects the impact of an increased focus on discretionary cost control and head count discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 22.3% of sales, which was approximately 310 basis points unfavorable to the third quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned gross margin challenges and the net negative impact resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Adjusted other income and expense decreased from 2021, primarily resulting from lower interest expense and favorable interest income. We anticipate Q4 OI&E to be approximately $70 million. Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of 14.5% to 15%, which is slightly lower than 2021.  Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.8 billion. Approximately $250 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $500 million.  Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components, pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory and seasonal inventory increases. Considering our third quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant and capital businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we now expect net sales in the full year to be adversely impacted by approximately 4% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.35 to $0.40 for the full year, which is included in our revised earnings guidance range. Based on continuing inflationary and supply chain pressures, balanced with our strong sales and additional cost-reduction actions and most significantly, the anticipated future impact of foreign currency, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.25. And now I will open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan Chase. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a really nice top line here. That said, I do want to ask my first question on operating margins both for third quarter and fourth quarter. And it came in a lot lower. It looks like half was for currency. I think -- what I'd like to know is how much of what we saw to the negative was transient in third quarter. And what's driving the strong sequential improvement into fourth quarter here? Glenn Boehnlein : Robbie, this is Glenn. Good questions. As we looked at the third quarter and the impact and what changed from Q2 specifically, we just -- what we saw was, we saw that our visibility to supply had improved and that we were seeing sort of moderate sort of improvement. But the rate of improvement relative to the cost was not improving at that kind of outlook. So we continue to see higher-than-expected premium costs. We saw other inflation across almost all categories. But as I noted, most noticeably in labor, metals, transportation. And then all of that and that sort of variability of supply chain really drove just inefficiencies in our manufacturing process. And so that -- we had lots of stops and starts, which, as you know, just drives up more cost. So I think if I think about it, what's transient, what's not, I think in Q4, we have good visibility to supply and feel confident enough to raise our sales guidance, which is what we did. And so we'll feel that in Q4.  I still think we're going to see a little bit of this fluid environment where we'll continue to experience some higher costs. And I would tell you that once we get our hands around sort of one electronic component issue, then we'll be contacted from a [N minus 2] vendor about another issue. And so we're feeling that sort of through -- as we're managing through sort of our supply chain issues. Robert Marcus : Great. And as we go into 2023, where I think everybody is starting to focus, I don't think there's much issue with the top line with 9.9 in the quarter, 8.5% to 9% for the year. That looks really good. I think people feel comfortable into next year. Where there's questions is down the P&L and on EPS. And Kevin, you mentioned the comment about strong EPS growth next year. I see The Street -- my numbers looks north of 50 basis points margin expansion. Next year, which might be a little high given the trends we're seeing here, would love to hear if you have any initial comments on thoughts on 2023 and particularly what that strong EPS growth means. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. We're going to give specific guidance in January, as we always do. But I did make that comment in my opening remarks to signal that this year is an aberration. We will get back to strong earnings, which does absolutely imply margin expansion in 2023. But specifics, we'll get to you in January. Operator : Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I wanted to ask first about the supply shortages. Kevin or Glenn, I don't know if you are willing to comment on how much you think they impacted you. How much do you expect to be impacted in Q4? And are these sales you expect to get back over time? And I had one follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Larry, I think not to give specific guidance on numbers relative to the disruptions, but suffice to say that on some products, we are very hand-to-mouth in terms of how we're getting componentry to complete those products and ship them to customers. On some, we have a little bit better visibility. I would tell you that with our order backlog at an all-time high, we are seeing pretty significant disruptions across our capital businesses. We're very focused on getting product to customers. We know that's important. And we are working hard to make sure that as we can secure supply that we work around the clock to get those products finished and get them out to customers. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Larry, what I'd add is our problems are in the MedSurg side of our business. And on the MedSurg side of our business, we're not going to lose sales. So if we have problems in the implant side, those sales would be lost to competitors. In this case, customers are waiting. The products aren't urgent. We do have a plan to get these products to our customers. Medical's numbers, which were pretty impressive at 13-plus percent organic, would have been materially higher because of the emergency care demand and the same with Instruments. Those are the two divisions that had the most impact. Frankly, we have a lot of nickeling issues across our portfolio, but those two divisions were severely impacted in Q3. You'll see recovery -- some recovery in Q4 and into next year. But I really don't expect to lose any of those sales, which gives me a lot of confidence going into next year that our sales -- positive sales trajectory will continue. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then maybe a little bit more color on the softness with Mako this quarter. How confident are you in the rebound in Q4? And Glenn, I know the other line is not just Mako, but when can we expect to see that line turn positive? Jason Beach : Larry, it's Jason. I'll start here and talk a little bit about Mako. And then, Glenn, if you want to comment on the other piece, feel free. But as it relates to Mako, like I said in my prepared remarks, the orders were soft. But if you look at the order pipeline, it is very robust. And we continue to be, I'll say, the robotic-assisted choice in the marketplace. And so we feel good about Q4. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a strong quarter. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Larry. The only thing I'd add is there are a couple of products in that line item other. But yes, you're right, that's where Mako is. I don't really want to guide you on Q4. I think sequentially, we will definitely see improvement. But in terms of when will we see full positivity, we'll talk about that in January. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Just one last comment to add. What I'm really encouraged by is quarter after quarter after quarter, we're seeing the knee -- Mako as a percent of our total Knees go up, hips as a percent of -- Mako Hips as a percent of total Hips go up, cementless percent of total Knees go up, and cementless tends to correlate very well with Mako. So all those vectors are heading the right direction. Yes, we've had some more delays in getting these robots installed and sold to our customers. But Q4 will be good and will continue our positive trajectory. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Guys, congrats on a good top line print here. Kevin, maybe my first question here is on '23. I guess, did I hear you guys say labor situation improves that big tailwind in '23? And how should we think about this capital versus supply chain impact, those dynamics, right? Its strong capital order book versus supply chain dynamics, how does that impact '23? Any new products that we should be thinking of? Again, I'm not asking for specific guidance, but maybe some qualitative comments on these variables. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Sure. I'll stay in the land of qualitative, Vijay, at this time of the year. But first, we are seeing a tailwind in procedural demand. So procedures are recovering around the world, a little slower in the Asia Pac regions. But given what happened with COVID, we expect that tailwind, as you saw, with very good growth in our Hip and Knee business that will continue into fourth quarter and I think a pretty modest or moderate tailwind in throughout 2023 and maybe even into 2024. So that's one positive tailwind. We have a number of new products we' re launching : System 9 camera in the early part of the year -- sorry, System 9 power tool in the early part of the year; 1780 camera around the middle of the year; and then we've got a defibrillator, which is a little less certain on timing because it's a PMA product, but the life pack perhaps towards the latter part of the year. But those are big, massive and important products. And you know what happens when we launch those products. I kind of call it a super cycle within MedSurg of new product launches. We have the Insignia Hips stem, which is less than 50% of the way launched. You know that these implant launches take multiple years to get all the sets out into the field, but tremendous momentum. You saw our Hip numbers have looked good the last couple of quarters relative to competition because of the Insignia Stem, and that will just continue to gain steam going forward. So those are a number of the positives. What I'd say on the order book side, that we know we have this big, big backlog of orders that customers are willing to wait for, in many cases, especially in emergency care. Orders are not being canceled. That gives us a lot of confidence that the demand is there. We just have to make sure we can get the supply to the customers. And we've been securing chips. We've been securing different products. But as Glenn mentioned, it's been hit and miss along -- sometimes it's just a resin, sometimes it's a small component. So there's been spottiness. It's getting better, but it's kind of getting better slowly. So we'll fight our way through that probably in the first half of next year. But tremendous demand in the absence of new products, and those new products will just sort of give us extra momentum going into next year. I just picked a few. But -- sorry for some of my divisions. I didn't mention the hip, the shoulder, the Foot & Ankle. And so there's a lot of other ones, but those are sort of the -- some of the big ones. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful color, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. At current FX rates, how should we think about EPS impact for '23? In the 250 basis points of gross margin impact, what is being capitalized? What percentage of that 250 basis points is being capitalized on the balance sheet? Glenn Boehnlein : Okay, Vijay. Vijay, the -- on the FX rates, without overly guiding for next year, but I think if you look at sort of what happened in 2022, rates really took off in sort of Q3, Q4. And so the comparable for Q1, Q2, I still think will have a pretty big impact for rates next year as you look at sort of your modeling for next year. And then in terms of just the capitalized variance piece, we -- I won't give you specifics. But I will remind you that to the extent we are making spot buys, it relates to raw materials that get put in inventory, and then the future utilization of those raw materials is usually over an 8- to 9-month time frame. So that gets a little bit more -- to Kevin's comment, that we'll still feel some of this into -- well into Q2 of next year. And to the extent we're still in a spot-buy-premium situation in Q1 of 2023, then that will bleed into, say, Q3 as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : The first one is the messaging has been very consistent throughout this year about the strong capital demand. And understand that there's a give and take between backlog of orders because the orders to fill orders canceled and new orders. So I guess, can you talk specifically on new orders during 3Q and what you're seeing for 4Q against your expectations? Jason Beach : Yes. Pito, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I would point you back to some of the commentary around the order book. And if you look at our capital businesses, it continues to be very strong. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, similar to the comments Kevin said around Medical and Instruments, we certainly expect a recovery in the fourth quarter with Instruments and another strong quarter for Medical as well. Kevin Lobo : And even Endoscopy, who had a very strong Q3, they grew their orders as well in the quarter. So they will also have another strong quarter in Q4. So it's really across our portfolio where the demand is very, very strong. And we're not seeing sort of a capital slowdown, which I know I've heard out that some other companies mentioned. We're just not seeing that in our orders. We're not having orders canceled. It's kind of -- it's something I haven't seen in my tenures here, customers ordering things and then canceling it. So we feel very good about our position. Our orders have not slowed down. They just continue to grow. Just one little example, which I really enjoy is on Vocera, we've now integrated that with our ProCuity bed. So the alerts for falls from the bed actually goes straight to the badge, and we're already showing this to our customers and getting really wild positive feedback from customers on this. And again, it's early days, but the ProCuity momentum, which really powered our strong Medical growth this quarter, is just building. And it's kind of the second year of the launch. It's really just gaining steam. And now with its interoperability with Vocera, that provides an extra bit of energy to that business. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. And then a follow-up on Neurovascular's a touch weaker this quarter. Just curious, how that is market versus competition versus supply shortages? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. We've seen a slow market this year in the U.S. in Neurovascular, not exactly sure why. There's a number of different theories out there as to why the market itself has been slow. I'd say that's probably most of it. But there are new competitors in both aspiration as well stent retrievers. The FDA has kind of reduced the requirements -- the clinical requirements in those categories. So there are a number of new players which affects part of it. But the market has been soft. And maybe it's a COVID issue that some of these patients that would have had strokes are not having stroke because of the mortality effects of COVID. It's hard to know exactly why, but the market has slowed down definitely in the U.S. I think that's probably the bigger portion, but there are also some competitive pressures. Keep in mind that for us, the U.S. is much smaller than our OUS business in Neurovascular, has always been that way. It's the one business that kind of has the reverse of the rest of our portfolio. So we continue to feel bullish about the long-term prospects on this business. We're only treating a small percentage of people that have strokes. And as I noted in my opening remarks, we've just completed signed an agreement for a tuck-in acquisition in the intraocular space. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: The first one is just on the restructuring you talked about. Is that something that's going to be impactful to next year, specifically to help drive that at EPS growth? And then do you have other levers that are kind of below the line that you can pull on that to help with the EPS growth for next year? Kevin Lobo : Well, EPS growth, as I mentioned, there'll be a combination of price. And in fact, some businesses are taking on their second round of price increases. And having the timing of those start to really appear as contracts roll off. So price is one component. Cost reduction clearly is another component. The restructuring -- these actions are very targeted. So it's really around things we were going to do anyways to improve our processes. We're just accelerating those activities. We'll see some of that this year. We'll see some of that into early part of next year, and it will have an impact in our earnings per share for sure next year. Glenn Boehnlein : And Matt, below the line, if you look at sort of in an taxes, it's -- there are some opportunities related to how quickly we pay down the term loan. So there could be some pickups relative to interest expense, although those would be minor given the rates. And then taxes is -- I don't expect any surprises, sort of steady as we've been there. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. And then on with the new -- sorry, go ahead. Kevin Lobo : I was going to say one last comment before. We will get mix benefits from the new products that we launched. So that's one thing to -- and you won't see that in the price line, but we'll definitely get that benefit through the P&L, which helps our earnings. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Kevin, I think back to the Analyst Day maybe 1.5 years ago, you talked about Mako with these new indications of shoulder and spine kind of coming out, I think, more a step -- like having one 1 year then one the following year. Is this now commentary about these two coming out at the same time because maybe Spine is getting pushed a little bit later than you expected before? And I didn't hear you specifically say spine and shoulder for Mako next year. So is this something we should expect more like '24 and beyond? Kevin Lobo : Yes. You know what, we're not ready to give you a time line now. I wouldn't expect it next year. But in one of the next upcoming calls, perhaps January or the one after that, we will give you some expected time lines. The reason that they're coming out at the same time now, there's two things. One is Spine's kind of moved ahead in its pace, and shoulder kind of moved back a little bit because we had to adapt to the Tornier implants and bring in the BLUEPRINT software and marry that with Mako. So we were on a certain time line with Stryker shoulder implants, but we wanted to switch to the Tornier implants. They're the market-leading implants. So we had to sort of delay that one. But Spine has been moved forward. So the team has done a terrific job. We had two projects that we are pursuing : the Cardan one as well as Mako. Mako is going to be the answer for us. We've already started to show some surgeons, and we've received very, very positive feedback on that. So we're excited. And so again, the timing, hopefully, possibly as early as January, I'll give you more specifics on it. As you know, robots are complicated. That's why we're sort of hesitant to first give you time lines until we feel more confident. But I'd say that a lot of the challenges that we had before, we've overcome. And we've had good meetings with the FDA. We're on a very good trajectory on both of those projects. Hard for me actually to know which one will be first as they'll come out pretty -- in pretty close proximity to each other. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Jennings with Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I wanted to start just on pricing. It sounds like guys are getting some traction there on your pricing initiatives. Should we be thinking about price turning positive? I think it's 70 basis points headwind in 3Q. Or is that too aggressive? Just wanted to get a better sense. And the follow-up question is just on just the ASCs with your ortho business, but primarily joints. Any updates just in terms of receptivity for Mako robots? And also just the pace of ASCs opening, and that seems to be maybe the bottleneck in terms of the pace of migration overall orthopedic procedures into ASCs. But wanted to just get a better sense of what you're seeing in ASCs as well. Glenn Boehnlein : Josh, it's Glenn. I'll take the first one on pricing. I think, first of all, we're having obviously some big initiatives going on around pricing, making sure that we're educating customers in terms of what's happening to us relative to the cost of raw materials and things like that. Pricing is mostly impacting MedSurg. That's not to say there's not as big of impact on the ortho side. Keep in mind, too, that most of our businesses are under some sort of contracts. And so a lot of this sort of pacing is relative to as those contracts come up for negotiation, we can enter into that with those customers. I think so far, we're seeing good progress. We expect to continue to see good progress into Q4. I won't call out a guide yet for next year. But what I would tell you, one of the things that also will give us a little bit of lift that may not be reflected in pricing is the comment that Kevin made relative to new products that are released. And most new products that are released are released at a premium price relative to the legacy price. And so that will give us a little bit of uplift as well. Kevin Lobo : Okay. And related to your question on ASCs, we -- our offense continues to exceed our expectation. Just the bundle that we provide for the ASC to make life easy for them has been very well received. Close to half of the deals that we win includes a Mako in these orthopedic ASCs. We've now crossed sort of the 10% mark of large joints that are done in ASCs. It keeps going up, not at a rapid rate, but it's a steady climb. And to your point, the gating factor is just construction and refurbishment of these ASCs to enable more procedures. But every hospital system I talked to is preparing themselves for another -- a new ASC. It's a trend that had started prior to COVID and has accelerated. And we expect that, that will continue. But we love our position. The breadth of our portfolio, having capital disposables and implants puts us in a really leading position. And Makos, as I said, almost all the time are included, and that gives us a giant advantage. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matthew Miksic : A lot of great color as been covered here. But I'd first just love to see the interoperability and connected care comments around Vocera and just color around Mako spine and shoulders is exciting. I wanted to just maybe focus a little bit back to margins on some of the purchasing comments you made, Glenn. And just to get a feel for how much of what impacted you in the third quarter had to do with spot buys purchases made in previous quarters. And whether any -- I think you mentioned that some of those prices are getting a little bit easier, which -- or better maybe, which then -- is that -- have we hit a high watermark in terms of the sort of impact on margins or is it too early to say? And I had one follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Yes, Matt, I think -- I mean a couple of things. As you sort of think about the guidance, the 250 basis points, in rough terms, half of that is being driven by sort of the premiums that we're paying on those spot buy purchases. And then the other half is really kind of solidly grounded in what we're seeing on the inflation and the inefficiency side, somewhat tempered by sort of some cost discipline even within our operations. On the spot buys, I think what I was saying is that we have better visibility now to our ability to acquire supply. We are seeing some moderation, although not as much as I think we were hoping to see, as we entered into Q3 in terms of what those costs are. So things are just -- they're not coming down as quick as we wanted them to nor do I expect that our spot purchases in Q4 will come down significantly either. And then on the inflation side, a lot of that is flowing through increases in labor, increases in commodity prices that we're paying. Because we're in this difficult supply chain situation, we're having to use a lot of, say, airfreight versus ocean freight, which cost a lot more to expedite raw materials coming in so that we can manufacture and get out to customers. And so those are the type of inflationary things that we're feeling that are in that number. Matthew Miksic : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one of the dynamics, Q3 to Q4, you mentioned that product mix was a bit of a headwind for you in Q3. Maybe if you could highlight some of the ways in which -- if you expect that to improve in Q4 or Q1. And around that, in particular, it seems like your businesses are sort of seeing a better look from some of the staffing challenges in hospitals than some other companies. And not everyone is seeing improvement. So just wondering how you think about what you're seeing in priorities of its and needs versus other procedures. Any color that you're getting that would kind of help folks understand what exactly is happening, what's happening and how it's maybe unevenly affecting different procedures and different settings? Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Let me take the first part of that question relative to mix and what we saw in Q3 and how we think that might play out in Q4. I think you can sort of look at sort of sales growth as a proxy for where we felt the pain of mix. Instruments was down, and that's a fairly highly profitable business for us. NV was also a little bit down, and that too is a highly profitable business for us. And so those not being a normal proportion of our sales really sort of hurt us somewhat at the margin line. I think Instruments has good visibility to supply moving into Q4, and so I do expect that we'll see a good performance out of Instruments as we wrap up the year. NV, it's a little bit different. It's not capital and there's not sort of a backlog of orders. NV is very procedural-based. But I know that NV is very focused on finishing out the year and hitting their quotas. And so I think we'll see some improvement out of NV as well. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Just last point on mix. I think Australia is one of the big, big markets for Stryker. And they've been hit by COVID and delays, and they do expect a stronger -- it's already started. We're seeing that start to build, and that's a highly profitable business as well. So those are -- that's another element of mix we're going to see improve in Q4 versus Q3. And then your other question, I'm not sure I totally got it, but I think you were talking about different procedures and how we're seeing the recovery and clearly get the needs. We're seeing robust recovery. There's big waiting lists, which in the U.K. and physicians who took -- maybe took some time off in summer a little bit more than they normally would, given coming off the COVID are very busy now, and they're starting to operate more. As much staff is available for them, the more they're going to operate. And staffing is still a little bit challenged, but it's been gradually improving. So there, we see robust kind of growth going into next year. Spine has been a little bit more choppy, to be honest. And I don't think it went down as much as the needs did. If you look at the Omicron variant and everything that -- spine procedures were still a little bit more resilient. And so we're not seeing that pop quite at the same extent as we are in our Hip and Knee. And I mentioned already Neurovascular in the U.S. where the market is soft, and that's the one that -- I saw some comments related to TAVR that talked about the market being a little bit soft. And I wonder if that patient profile with all these comorbidities, there might be something similar that could be impacting the ischemic stroke portion of the market. So that's -- hopefully answered that part of your question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise : Kevin, two questions for me. First, we've touched on it a little bit, but you talked about Asia Pacific being -- continuing to be volatile and China negative growth and that -- those pressures continuing through the end of '22. Just in general, at a high level, are you -- what's the setup for next year? Are you assuming as you look at the landscape that things are going to get better? Just, again, your high-level thoughts there? Kevin Lobo : Sure. Sure. At a high level, COVID has had a delayed impact in a lot of Asia Pacific. And we certainly expect to get better. We're already seeing it. Japan had a really nice quarter this quarter. Australia will pick up in Q4. Some of the ASEAN countries are improving. So I do expect the outlook to be better next year in Asia Pacific overall than this year. Our emerging markets had really robust double-digit growth in spite of China being slightly negative. It was negative really driven by volume-based procurement in the orthopedic side of our business and pretty good performance on the MedSurg and Neurotechnology side of the business. But we, finally, after many years, started to build tremendous momentum in Latin America as well as emerging Europe, at least in Africa, where we're gaining really tremendous momentum with -- really driven by Mako as well as our 1688 camera. That's driving really strong growth this year. And I think that should continue going into next year. Even India has really had a terrific year this year. And as you know, we've had our share of challenges in the past. So I would say the international story for Stryker is starting to click. As you saw since 2019, our international organic growth has outpaced the U.S., and that did not happen in my first seven years as CEO. And I do expect that to continue. And frankly, the COVID tailwind should really cement that going forward. Rick Wise : Great. And one other sort of big-picture question, Kevin. I mean you usually have great perspectives on this kind of stuff. One of the toughest questions to answer for me is how, when, where do some of these supply chain issues, particularly around chips, how does it get resolved? When does it get resolved? And I'd be curious to hear what you're thinking for the industry. But what are you thinking -- how are you going to resolve this so that you can stop boring about it for Stryker? Is it just you just have to wait? Or are there tangible steps that you can take or the industry needs to take still to get past this topic? Appreciate that. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, it's a great question. I would tell you this year has been extremely frustrating unlike any year I've had where, to be honest, we misestimated. We thought early on, we were going to have 100 to 200 basis points of pressure. And now Glenn is saying it's 250. So that's something we did not call. It's been difficult to predict. I think one of the steps that we're taking, which is really kind of exciting, is as you move to new products, so as we move to System 9 and as we move to 1788, we're using new-generation chips. And the supply availability is actually quite high for new-generation trips. And so the faster we can migrate to new products, it actually helps secure our ability to have supply. And so we are pushing our R&D teams really hard to be able to shift to these newer products because our challenge is, frankly, the older-generation chips. And that's why emergency care is so pressured, emergency care being defibrillators primarily. Because their PMA products, we can't just swap the chip out. It goes through a whole regulatory regime, and those are older-generation chips. So the faster we can migrate to new products, the faster that secures our chip availability. It's been kind of a moving target as we've secured chips with one supplier, we have a new problem with another supplier. And even things like resins. And so it's been a very unusual and tough year, but it's slowly getting better, Rick. And as we launch new products, that will get us really healthy because new chips aren't the problem. Our problem is really getting the old electronics. And frankly, the camera business, I give our Endoscopy team a lot of credit that they were able to actually qualify some new products. And because it's not P&A, they were able to really drive good growth, but it's been a scramble. And we're hopeful that things get stable. Really, I think we're going to be in this soup for probably another couple of quarters by the middle of the year. And then I think the guys will start to clear. But you know what, that's -- I don't know a total crystal ball, and we haven't been right this year. But that's sort of how it looks right now, that they'll still be a little choppy, but it's just moderately getting better as we go through the year. Operator : Next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Drew Ranieri : Kevin and Glenn, just maybe, Kevin, on your comments about ProCuity, the bed launch, you're gaining momentum there and it's in your second year of launch. Just kind of curious how launch is progressing. And if you could give us an update on where you are in terms of market share, the replacement cycle. And then really, what should we expect now that you have integrated Vocera into the ProCuity bed? Should that have a meaningful acceleration into the ProCuity launch? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I'm very bullish on ProCuity. It's a fantastic product, and the cross-sell capability with Vocera, where we were strong, let's say, with ProCuity or beds and Vocera wasn't as strong or Vocera. Conversely, Vocera was strong, but we didn't have a strong bed position. That cross-sell opportunity is already presenting itself. We've been in front of some very big accounts, and we're showing them this integrated system. And we've already gotten some orders. And so I'm bullish. It had a terrific third quarter. We're trying to make them as fast as we can right now, which is a high-class problem. And so I think you're going to see very good results for ProCuity. It's a winning bed, and Vocera is just going to add gas to the fire. Drew Ranieri : And Glenn, maybe one for you, but I know you don't necessarily want to give '23 guidance at all. But just as you're thinking about free cash flow and Kevin's comments about strong EPS growth for next year, can you help us contextualize that on maybe what free cash flow growth we should see for next year or working capital improvements? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think right now, just given all the variability in kind of where we are, we're just focused on this year and finishing up. I'd hate to throw out a number for free cash flow conversion. I think it would be safe to assume that it wouldn't be far away from our historical averages, and that's probably where we would land for next year. Keep in mind, for next year, our focus will still be debt repayment. And we'll pay down the rest of that term loan before we allocate other capital to M&A. Operator : Our next question comes from David Saxon with Needham & Company. David Saxon : Maybe to start on extremities. Just wondering what you're seeing in the foot and ankle market. Did any procedures perform better or worse than others? And then I'll ask my second question upfront here. Maybe can you talk about the Q Guidance System, how that early launch is going? And maybe you can touch on the launch strategy, pricing and feedback you got from NASS. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So starting with Foot & Ankle had a really terrific Q3. The highest growth within Foot & Ankle is coming out of our total ankle where we have a clear market leadership that had double-digit growth. But even though the midfoot, 4-foot procedures are picking back up, as you know, the pandemic did kind of slow entente somewhat, but they had a very good Q3. We had a number of new launches in that category for foot launches. So we're feeling very good about that going forward. But it was a strong Q3 that contributed to -- especially in the United States, that contributed to the double-digit growth that we had in Trauma Extremities in the U.S. in the second year. Oh, Q Guidance, yes. We had really terrific feedback because -- it's an incredibly fast internally developed camera, much faster than what you see the competition using. It also actually provides suggestions about which screws to use and -- so that's very novel as well. And that will be the camera that will be ported to Mako for the future, and it really simplifies the workflow. Very, very positive feedback. That contributed to the strong enabling technology performance. So we had a number of very good sales of the Q Guidance System in Q3, and that's picking up into Q4. So, so far so good on that launch. Obviously, we still want to get to Mako. And we also have another project called CoPilot. That's the kind of the internal code name, which is really around drills and providing some haptic feedback, which we were able to show some of the surgeons at NASS to great feedback because that doesn't exist in the market today. So we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio in enabling technology for Spine. It's going to take us some time to bring these additional products to the market, but Q Guidance was very well received, especially because of the speed and efficiency that we offer without requiring them to change their workflow. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Steven Lichtman : A couple of follow-ups. Jason, in capital, we talked a lot this evening about supply. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about installation delays due to variability in the hospital environment and scheduling challenges. Can you provide a little more color on what you're seeing specifically when you talk about that and the variability? And were those comments related to both traditional Medical and Mako? And then I just have a quick one for Glenn. Jason Beach : Yes. I'd say a couple of different things just as you think about that and think about capital. Obviously, our larger capital is beyond Mako, right? But what we're seeing is sometimes I think when we talk about staffing challenges, people go right to nurses and some of those things. But really, what we're talking about here is even like if you think about our comm business, you'll have scheduled installations. People show up to do an install. They'll get canceled. They'll have to come back. And so that's the variability that I'm referring to that sometimes delays installs, and ultimately, revenue and gets pushed out. Glenn, in terms of second piece? Glenn Boehnlein : He didn't ask yet. Steven Lichtman : Yes. So Glenn, just my -- the follow-up for Glenn, just one variable for next year I wanted to ask you about is FX. So I mean based on where rates are today -- I mean, you talked about some of the -- qualitatively about the impact next year, but would the impact next year versus this be about the same as what you're seeing this year versus last based on where rates are sitting today? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think without doing the math or having any other basis in next year, if I just look at rates, it's, yes, roughly going to be the same. We'll be more precise in January, but that's a pretty good starting point. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Happy Halloween. Just a couple for me. Kevin, we're a few years past the K2 acquisition. And given where the performance has been these past few years, I wanted to get your assessment of kind of the Spine business and how you feel that's come together. And that dovetails into my next question, which is just Vocera having some disruptions. What did you learn from the disruptions in Q2? And kind of what are you expecting from the disruption you have in Vocera and how you maybe improve upon what you went through with K2 in terms of disruption with Vocera? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So let me first say the Vocera disruption is very different than K2M destruction. K2M is an overlap deal, where you have the same sales reps selling the same kinds of products. That's the hardest kind of deal to integrate. Frankly, we learned a lot from K2M that we then put into our Wright Medical integration, which has gone extremely well. That's more analogous where the Foot & Ankle is an example or upper extremities, you have overlapping reps. Vocera is not an overlap deal. So that one is going to be a lot easier to get through. We did the same thing with Physio-Control. If you remember, we merged the emergency care, our power costs for the ambulances with defibrillators, and we merged that sales force. And we had some disruption in the first year that we got through pretty fast. And then we got into a torrid double-digit kind of growth trajectory thereafter. So Vocera will have a little bit of disruption. It's not just because of the sales force, but also because we'd like to move more of the business to the cloud, which will be better for us and better for our customers long term versus being on-premise. And so we don't mind taking a little bit of pain in the -- for the next quarter or two. But thereafter, you should expect that to be able to sing. It's a lot easier from an integration standpoint. This is just running this record offense without having to have reps competing.  As I think about Spine, it's obviously the most competitive market we play in. It's a very tough market. K2M was not a very expensive acquisition compared to alternatives that we looked at the time. It's been okay deal. It hasn't been one of our best deals, but it solved a problem for us where we would have frankly been growing below-market rates had we not done the deal. We were able to kind of hang on to be able to grow around market rates with some good innovation. And now that we've got our enabling technology road map, I'm actually pretty excited about Spine in the future. It's going to continue to be a bit of a dogfight through sort of the end of next year, but going into '24, already with Q Guidance, we have a bit of a spring in our step, a new expandable distribution deal with Life Spine. So we're starting to feel a little bit of momentum, our Monterey new launch as well. So we're starting to feel a bit of momentum, but it's not having a robot as a problem. We do have this project with Mako that will help solve that problem. And we are committed to Spine long term. But clearly, it is the most challenging market of all. But certainly don't -- for me, Vocera will have probably roughly flat sales growth year-over-year for Q4, Q1, and then you should expect Vocera to start to zoom after that. Ryan Zimmerman : That's very helpful. And then if I could just squeeze one more in real quick. In terms of delivery, you talked about some of the capital cycle and the dynamics of the supply chain. And just if you were to order a product today from you guys and upon receipt, it takes maybe 90 days under normal circumstances, just help us understand some of these orders that are pulling through or extending beyond the quarter. I mean I don't know if you guys, Glenn, want to quantify this. But is it 20 days now because of the delays -- 110 days total, I mean? Is it a few months after? Just as we think about kind of the extension of the order book, which still tends to be strong, what does this mean quantitatively in terms of order to delivery? Jason Beach : Ryan, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. And what I would say is, first off, I'd point you back to my prepared remarks in terms of this being a moderate tailwind for some time, right? In terms of how much longer is the delivery cycle, candidly, it's going to vary by product cycle, right, or the type of product that it is. And so we're certainly not going to quantify in terms of the impact there, but it certainly does vary. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : I'll just ask a follow-up on that theme, I guess. I was really interested in your comments about kind of the procedural backlog and perhaps taking some time to burn off in addition to your order book. So the royalty that up is just as, a, are there areas of your portfolio where you see greater or lesser backlog, just to help us think about how those things could come back over time? And I guess, what are you looking at to predict that you could actually see this procedural runoff take more than 2023 and into 2024? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think Hip and Knees are the areas where I think it's not just a Stryker thing. I think the market will be more robust. And certainly, you can talk to our competitors, and I think they would share that osteoarthritis doesn't improve itself. These patients are going to need these procedures. Aging population and demographics play in our favor. And I think you're going to see that tailwind. It's just -- I just don't think it's going to be -- surgeons aren't going to be operating on weekends, and their staffs not available to have a big spike and then kind of a return to normal. That's why I think it will be a gradual tailwind for multiple quarters. But those are -- that's the business I think you're going to see that kind of sustained positive momentum on the surgery volumes. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist. Samuel Brodovsky : This is Sam on for the team. Just -- I'll just ask both ears upfront. Just on SG&A about, call it, 100-ish basis points improvement in 2Q, 3Q here. Should we think about that being sustainable in the 4Q? And then with the restructuring, is there room for that to continue to improve into '23? And then similar question on R&D. I mean, should we think about that 7% level being right for the full year? And how should we think about that directionally into '23? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Sam, this is Glenn. On SG&A, I think generally, the only thing that really becomes significantly variable is just sales commissions that flows through there. So in terms of the kind of procedures and controls that we put in place relative to discretionary cost control, we should see that continue into Q4. And so that's probably a pretty good proxy.  And then on R&D, we've been hovering at that level, honestly, for several quarters. And so the only variability might be that sales are a little larger in Q4, which might actually make the percentage go down a little bit in R&D. But I do think that, that run rate is a good approximate. Kevin Lobo : For the full year. Glenn Boehnlein : For the full year. Samuel Brodovsky : Is that on a dollar basis? Glenn Boehnlein : On a percentage basis. Kevin Lobo : Percentage. Glenn Boehnlein : 6%, 7% of sales roughly, that's a pretty good number for a full year. Keep in mind, Q4 is seasonally our strongest. So you are going to see much higher op margin than you've seen certainly in the last 2 quarters in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : I'll just be quick here, realizing we're deep in the call. But just on China, when do you expect the VBP dynamics to subside or anniversary for you? Jason Beach : This is Jason. I'll take this one. So just as a reminder, right, China overall is less than 2% of our sales. And the sales that are exposed to VBP are actually less than 1%, so fairly immaterial. But relative to kind of the next impact, there will be an impact as we go into next year around NV. Obviously, we're not going to guide at this point, but you'll hear more about that as we get into next year. Jayson Bedford : And Jason, does that start in '23? Or will you see any impact here in the fourth quarter? Jason Beach : It will start in '23. Again, we'll talk more about timing when we get closer, but it will be '23. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeff Johnson : Just a quick follow-up. Really just a clarification. Jason, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Mako installs being delayed during the quarter. I think in a follow-up to Larry Biegelsen's question, you talked about orders for Mako being soft. Just was orders, was it the installs? And maybe a little more color just on what exactly happened in the third quarter and what the confidence is that recovering in the fourth. Jason Beach : Yes. No, my comments were definitely specific to installs. I may have made a comment relative to a strong order book, which is absolutely the case, and we do expect a strong fourth quarter. Operator : There are no more questions waiting. So I will pass the conference back over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Well, thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year-end 2022 results with you as well as our 2023 guidance in January. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, Mako performance insights and updates on Vocera and Wright Medical. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2023 guidance before we open the call to Q&A. I will begin with the macroeconomic environment. 2022 was a year where we, alongside many companies, faced unprecedented supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. We faced these challenges and delivered for over 130 million patients and for our customers all over the world. We also remain focused on the future, as we progress our pipeline of innovation, enabling a super cycle of new product launches across our portfolio in 2023 and 2024. I want to thank our 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination and agility. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.2%, which brought our full year organic sales growth to 9.7%. During my 10-plus years in this role, these were record quarterly and annual growth rates. The growth was balanced across our businesses and regions in implants, disposables and capital equipment, and was highlighted by our Medical division, which had Q4 organic sales growth of over 25%. Additionally, for the fifth consecutive year, our international organic growth rate exceeded our U.S. growth rate, demonstrating the progress we are making on globalization. This was highlighted by Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging markets, which all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. International growth remains a significant opportunity in the years ahead that should continue to complement our strong U.S. business. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3 and $9.34, respectively, exceeding our latest guidance range. This was driven by our strong sales performance, which offset inflationary pressures and negative foreign currency. Also, we are progressing with our actions to address higher costs, which include both pricing and targeted restructuring plans. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives and expect an improving trend over the course of 2023. We also expect the positive trends in procedural recovery to continue alongside strong demand for capital products. And while component availability will continue to be variable in 2023, we do expect that it will gradually improve throughout the year, lessening the need for spot buys. We will remain disciplined with our spend and we will continue to invest in innovation, including potential tuck-in M&A. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2023 guidance of organic sales growth of 7% to 8.5%. This growth combined with the continued challenging macro emit environment, our pricing and cost actions will translate to an adjusted EPS of $9.85 per share to $10.15 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, as well as Mako, Vocera and Wright Medical. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the fourth quarter in most countries. Parts of Asia-Pacific, however, have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures have continued in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q3 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very healthy in the quarter, as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Even considering our finish, we exited the year with a very strong order book. Next, specific to Mako, we had a record quarter of installations in both the U.S. and internationally. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and will continue to offer flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. The great progress of our Mako offense has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw approximately 55% of knees and almost 30% of hips performed using Mako in the quarter. Also, in December, we surpassed our 1 million cementless knee procedure with cementless knees continuing to index higher in make accounts. So in addition to being the leader in robotic-assisted surgery, we are also well ahead on cementless knee adoption. Finally, we are making good progress with the development of our Mako spine and shoulder applications, and expect to have the initial launch of spine in the back half of 2024 and the initial shoulder launch at the end of 2024. Now to our key acquisition and integration activities, our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, we will anniversary in February of this year. Q4 results were consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, as is the expected sales ramp beginning in Q2 of this year. Turning the page to Wright Medical, we have now passed the two-year mark of the integration of Wright Medical. This has been our largest acquisition to-date. Now complete, we have exceeded expectations on both our sales and synergy assumptions, as the cultural fit was strong and we implemented our integration playbook very effectively. Additionally, it was a catalyst that drove the creation of three separate business units, allowing us to serve unique customers across core trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle. All three businesses exited the year with terrific momentum and strong R&D pipelines. Overall, this acquisition has proven to be a great success and we are excited about what the future holds. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter\u2019s average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable by 0.6%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.8% unfavorable impact on sales, the supply chain disruption somewhat lessened during the quarter and our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remains strong. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.2%. International organic sales growth was 18.3%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 9.7% with U.S. organic sales growth of 8.9% and international organic growth of 11.7%. The impact from pricing in the year was unfavorable by 0.9% and 2022 had the same number of selling days as 2021. Our adjusted EPS of $3 in the quarter was up 10.7% from 2021, driven by higher sales and strict cost discipline, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange translation, which was unfavorable $0.16. Our full year adjusted EPS was $9.34, which represents growth of 2.8% from full year 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth, lower net interest costs and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.31. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 19.3%, with organic sales growth of 16.9%, which included 14.9% of U.S. organic growth and 22.5% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7%, led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.7%, highlighted by strong growth in sports medicine, communications, video, general surgery and ProCare. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 22.9%, driven by our emergency care and acute businesses. The growth was fueled by double-digit growth across our emergency care and Prime Structure businesses, and also benefited from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had organic sales growth of 1.5%, driven by continued market softness and competitive pressures. The U.S. Neurocranial business had impressive organic growth of 19.7%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, silver glide bipolar forceps and Max space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 22.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.3% with organic sales growth of 8.4%, which included organic growth of 6.2% in the U.S. and 13.6% internationally. Our U.S. hip business grew 11.3% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem, the ongoing success of the Mako THA 4.1 software upgrade and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 7.8% organically against a very strong Q4 2022 comparable of over 14%. This reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.9% organically with strong performances across all three businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle, and strong performances in plating and nailing. Our U.S. Spine business grew 0.5%, led by performance in our enabling technology business, including the recently launched Q Guidance navigation system. U.S. Other Ortho declined organically by 18.7%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 13.6% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and India. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.7% was unfavorable, approximately 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021 and in line with Q3 2022, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs, and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.5% of sales, which represents a 90-basis-point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, which was slightly higher than our 2021 adjusted R&D spending of 6.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.6% of sales, which was 150 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects the impact of increased focus on discretionary cost control and headcount discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 26.6% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures, primarily on gross margin and the negative impact, resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline. Other income and expense of $53 million for the quarter decreased from 2021, primarily due to net favorable interest income. For 2023, we expect a quarterly run rate of $65 million for other income and expense. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.8% and 14%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $13 billion. Approximately $150 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $650 million. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.6 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by lower accounts receivable collections due to higher sales at the end of the year, the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory during the year. For 2023, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $600 million. Again, in 2023, we do not plan to do any share buybacks and we will continue to focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide 2023 full year sales and earnings guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will continue to be macroeconomic volatility, including supply chain constraints, recession and inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. Despite this environment, we have positive momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2023, including continued procedural recovery, many new product introductions and a very robust order book for our capital products. Given the above, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8.5% for the full year 2023 when compared to 2022. There are the same number of selling days in 2023 compared to 2022, with one extra day in Q1 and one less day in Q3. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be between zero percent and minus 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. While we are not specifically guiding the quarters, keep in mind that as you compare the first quarter to the prior year quarter, Q1 2022 did not have the inflationary pressures that we are now experiencing. So despite a strong growth outlook, we do not expect Q1 EPS to be much better than Q1 2022. Finally, for the full year 2023, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.85 to $10.15, representing a return to op margin expansion. This guidance range assumes a gradual improvement of the global operating environment, including a progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really nice quarter. I wanted to start out on the MedSurg side of the business, where you had really, really strong performance in the fourth quarter. You talked about a healthy order book, but I was hoping you could give a little more visibility into exactly what you saw, was there a bolus of demand there, was this all underlying or catch-up demand and then you talked about a healthy order book, but just what you are seeing in terms of your hospital clients around the world and their desire to continue to buy capital here? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. As you can tell, Robbie, it was a terrific quarter for all of Instruments, Endoscopy and Medical. Medical in particular, had a giant growth in the quarter, really digging out of some of the backlog that they had of orders. If you look at the backlog entering 2023, it\u2019s actually higher than what we had at the end of 2022. So it was a little bit of catch-up from prior quarters, but as we think about next year, right, the outlook for all divisions is strong again next year. We also have a lot of new products coming in those three divisions. So strong order book, strong demand for our product, strong cans of new pipeline, terrific leadership teams. This really -- these three divisions have been, if you go back even from 2016, there -- every year they are either high single-digit or low double-digit growers and that was no different in 2022. Robbie Marcus : Great. And maybe a follow-up for Glenn, you talked about second half, probably, better than first half. I have been on this call a bit before this call and you talked about first quarter EPS not being much better year-over-year. Any other color you could give us both on the topline as we think about 2023, just given there are some highly variable growth rates on the topline, as well as margin things to think about down the P&L? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Yeah. First of all, just picking up where Kevin left off, if you think about the topline, entering the year with such a strong order book, it\u2019s really going to kind of bode well for growth of our big capital businesses. The other thing we are really seeing is this procedural expansion and so we feel really good about our momentum, especially in hips and knees and trauma and extremities. So we are going to continue to see those grow as well. That plays into the mix of what we see when we get down to gross margin. We do think the first half of the year we will be working our way through some of that higher dollar inventory that was built up at the end of last year. We are seeing some bright spots in supply chain. We are seeing an environment where we think there will be less spot buys and so all of that will go into in terms of us progressively improving both our gross margin and our op margin. I think the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that, our pricing initiatives and actions really took hold in Q4 and we felt that especially on the MedSurg side. We will benefit from those actions for the full year in 2023. We will also see that\u2019s not included in price. All the new products that Kevin talked about that we will launch, those come out at premium prices. So that will also benefit and help us with our op margin improvement. And then the last thing is, we still have some targeted restructurings that will take place in 2023, especially in the first half of 2023. So we will also begin to feel the benefit of those in the second half. So I think Q1 is a little pressured year-over-year just because the inflation wasn\u2019t sitting in last year\u2019s op margin and it is sitting in 2023 op margin. But I think as the year progresses, we will continue to improve on that op margin, and obviously, that will drive to the EPS growth that we guided to. Robbie Marcus : Really helpful. Congrats again. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Matthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Kevin, at the Analyst Day, when was it, this was a couple of years ago, you really exercised international. The performance in the quarter was phenomenal and it\u2019s been really strong. I am just wondering the durability of that and should we think about international being not quite half of the growth on the topline this year, but something around that level. Is that how important international should be for you guys in 2023 and even beyond? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Rather than thinking about what percentage of the growth is, is just how durable is it? Five years in a row now, organic sales growth has exceeded the U.S. organic sales growth, and of course, China has really didn\u2019t contribute anything in 2022. So Europe was double-digit grower. It\u2019s a growth engine for Stryker. I have talked about Europe for the last six years or seven years and we are hitting our stride in Europe. But even other emerging markets, whether it\u2019s Latin America, whether it\u2019s the Middle East, Eastern Europe, parts of East Asia, we have really started to hit our stride. It feels exciting. We have great leadership teams. We are getting great penetration now with Mako and fluorescence imaging, some of those power brands are now really starting to show up effectively. So the way I\u2019d like to think about it is that emerging markets should grow roughly double the growth rate of Stryker\u2019s growth rate, and overall, we should continue to grow above the Stryker growth rate in these international markets. And as over time, if we don\u2019t continue to have large acquisitions in the U.S. then that will become a bigger and bigger percentage of our business. But being acquisitive it\u2019s still pretty small, if you think about 72% roughly of our sales are in the United States. But it\u2019s starting to have a material impact and you saw really an outstanding quarter in Q4. Matthew O'Brien: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong finish year. Kevin, maybe the first one on the performance here in the fourth quarter, at least organic, that\u2019s quite outstanding. Sequentially, it looks like your growth accelerated by 350 basis points. Is this -- can you put some -- put those numbers in context for us? Is this share gains or is this your supply chain situation improving? And I am assuming there was some headwind from China, maybe if you could quantify it and just help us understand what went into that pretty stellar 13% number in the fourth quarter? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Look, I think, the outsized growth is in the Medical division, right? So Medical division isn\u2019t going to typically grow 26% organic, right? That\u2019s outsized and that\u2019s really, let\u2019s call it, making up for supply. So they had huge orders and we were able to get healthy in some of the product lines and we were able to get a lot of shipments out the door. That kind of variability could happen from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at a full year kind of organic growth rate, Instruments 10%, Endoscopy 15%, Medical 11%, kind of on a rolling four-quarter basis. Those are really outstanding results. So it\u2019s not a one quarter wonder. I would kind of look at the overall year having organic growth of 9.7%. That\u2019s the highest I have had in my tenure. And we have new products, I would say, they are as good a set of pipeline as I have had since I have been in this role. So that bodes well for next year. We are starting with the highest organic growth guide that we have ever started with and assuming launches go well and everything, this should be another very, very strong year. I think you will see a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter primarily with Medical, because they do have the largest backlog of all the divisions in the company and a more consistent performance with the implants side of the house. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe off of those comments, Kevin, and maybe perhaps for Glenn as well, that 7% to 8.5% guide for fiscal 2023, is that a front-loaded guidance? Just when I look at the comps here for 2022, is that so 8.5% front-loaded? And what is it assuming for supply chain, are you assuming supply chain to improve just given off of Q4 levels? And the order that you mentioned, Kevin, did that backlog grow versus third quarter or are we starting to work down on the backlog? Glenn Boehnlein : Hi, Vijay. I will take some of these. If I miss a part, you can correct me. First of all, the growth is not front-end loaded. It\u2019s pretty steady throughout each of the quarters and you will see that there is going to be solid growth just given sort of the momentum that we are feeling from fourth quarter. In terms of the order book, we exited 2022 with an increase in the order book year-over-year. So we are actually feeling very bullish about capital sales, about our customer\u2019s willingness to buy capital. So we don\u2019t -- we feel like that\u2019s a great tailwind for the whole year and did I miss the third part? Kevin Lobo : No. I think you probably\u2026 Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Okay. Vijay Kumar : Sorry, on the supply chain situation. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. As I mentioned, we assume that we will see gradual improvement in the supply chain. We saw some of that in Q4. We actually feel pretty good about our access to supply, we are seeing a reduced volume of spot buys, which are those really high cost items and we are also beginning to work with our original set of vendors and also going up the food chain and actually working with chip suppliers so that we feel like we have a good handle on what\u2019s going to happen with supply chain, but it should become better quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter with good improvement and visible improvement in the back half of the year. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC. You may proceed. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was just wondering what you have assumed for margin expansion in 2023 relative to your at least 30 basis points of outlook that you previously shared. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the VCON [ph] business in hips and knees. In knees, your major competitor does have a new cementless launch. Do you see that as a price mix benefit for them or something that could drive competitive account conversion, and then on hips, it came out stronger than what we were expecting. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers and if we could see meaningful share gains on the hip side, similar to what we have seen in knees? Thank you for taking the questions. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Yeah. Great question. I will start out and just touch on the margin expansion. We typically do not guide on op margins. So we are not going to pinpoint an expansion number. I think backing up from EPS and looking at tax and OI&E and where we are with sales that, you will see that the math doesn\u2019t work unless we expand op margin. So I think what you will see is a progressive improvement each quarter in that expansion, especially as the comparable includes inflation from the prior year, so that\u2019s what our plan is. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. And related to joints, obviously, we are delighted with the year that we have had in both hips and knees. Having global double-digit growth in both hips and knees is terrific. The hip strength clearly driven by the launch of the Insignia Hip Stem, and as a reminder, we are only about a little less than halfway through that launch. So we still have a lot of sets to get out. It will take us all of this year and maybe into a little bit of the first quarter of 2024 to be fully launched with Insignia. So we are still kind of in the gaining momentum mode with Insignia and that\u2019s coupled with the 4.1 Mako hip software. So we can -- we expect hips to continue to be very strong. As it relates to knees, clearly, that\u2019s been an outperformer for us for the past six years, seven years since we launched the Mako Total Knee application. And with cementless, where we continue to gain, I am not at all worried about competitive entrants on cementless. People aren\u2019t going to move away from our cementless for a competitive product when we have tremendous proven, Jason mentioned, 1 million procedures already done and competitors just starting to launch theirs. They are going to be awfully very cautious before they move to another product on something like that and that synergy with cementless and Mako is really significant. Last thing I\u2019d say is, we are launching new software, just like we did with hip with the 4.1, we call it, TKA 2.0 Mako software. We have just -- we are in the middle of a limited launch. It\u2019s going exceptionally well. We expect the full launch sometime by around Q3 of that new software upgrade, which creates better user experience, better for training residents and teaching hospitals, so very, very good feedback on that. So we do expect to continue to outperform in both knees and hips again in 2023. Shagun Singh : Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. You may proceed. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Not to take away, this is a really good quarter, Kevin, but I do want to ask about two segments that are maybe a little softer than expectations. Neurovascular and Spine, both come on the back of what I think what we would consider easier comps and you can probably challenge me on that. But what are you contemplating in terms of your guidance for growth in those areas for 2023, and just commentary on both the Neurovascular and the Spine segment this quarter and kind of what impacted results? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. No. Certainly, on the Neurovascular comps, I -- we did have pretty good performance a year ago in Neurovascular. I think that the challenge is kind of looking at versus the prior year Neurovascular and then going back versus 2019. So, but certainly, we have had our challenges with Neurovascular in the U.S. We have had continued good growth outside the United States and I think I have mentioned on prior calls that the ischemic market segment has certainly gotten softer. There are a lot more competitors that are kind of distracting and taking up time. We still think it\u2019s a great market. There\u2019s still a lot of patients that are -- that have not been treated. We are only treating a small percentage of people that have these large vessel occlusions in the brain. So we do think it\u2019s a good long-term market. We are launching a new coil called Tetra Coil here in the United States, which is exciting. And we will continue to invest. We have a deal that\u2019s pending. Obviously, regulatory clearances before it closes on a one and done for the hemorrhagic segment. We are very excited about that. acquisition. That will give us another shot in the arm. So, yes, we have had our challenges in the U.S. this year. We continue to grow very well outside the United States. It\u2019s still a market we are very committed to. That\u2019s kind of on the Neurovascular side. On the Spine side, look, the launch of Mako Spine is going to be critical. The Q Guidance launch is going very well and that was important for us. We had a gap, obviously, with enabling technologies, which is really important in the Spine segment. So I do believe this is, 2023 will be a year where we will continue to grow kind of around the market growth rate and then really get ready for the Mako launch to be able to start to grow above market. So, yes, they are not as glowing, the divisions, right now as some of our other divisions. But they are certainly competing well in the marketplace, growing roughly in line with the market, maybe a little bit below, but still highly profitable, highly important businesses to the long-term future of Stryker. Ryan Zimmerman : Very helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. I mean this was the first time you really, I think, put those time lines out on spine and shoulder. We have kind of danced around these topics for some time. What is it now that\u2019s a comfort to put those out there and ensure that those will be on time with the time lines you outlined? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. As a company, we tend to be pretty conservative on getting time lines and robots are hard, right? Ask any of the companies who are trying to launch robots, whether they are in heart tissue robotics or soft robotics. Robots are difficult. What gives us confidence is our prototypes are built. We have tested it with surgeons. We have gotten feedback. We have had some meetings in one case with the agency to get an idea on the regulatory pathway. So we have enough in the pipeline right now. There\u2019s always a little bit of uncertainty around approvals and full launch. And notice the term I used was initial launch, right? So we do expect to get approved and to start doing cases. But then as you do those initial cases, you might have to refine some of the training and things, so it might be a little bit slow out of the gate, we will see. The beauty of our approach is it\u2019s the same robot that\u2019s being used for hips and knees that\u2019s going to be used and we have, as you know, thousands of them now out there. So that is exciting that we will be able to just do a software upgrade and have a different attachment and be able to use the same robot and I think a lot of hospitals will be excited about that if the robots not being used on one day of the week and they can have that being used for spine initially and then as the demand increases, then they can have a dedicated robot for spine. So we really believe that will be different than when we started where each robot had to sort of justify it on its own. Having one sort of robot with all these different applications will be powerful over time. But we feel confident just based on we spent a lot of money, and we spent a lot of time on this. The shoulder one took a little longer. As you recall, we were -- we thought that was initially going to be before spine, but we decided to move away from our implants to the Tornier implants and to use the BLUEPRINT planning software. So that caused a slight delay. But the teams are really working well and we are -- the feedback we are getting from surgeons that are seeing it is extremely positive. Ryan Zimmerman : Great. Looking forward to it. Thank you for taking my questions. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. We are too. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vik Chopra with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Vik Chopra : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Vik on for Larry Biegelsen. Kevin, you talked about a super cycle of new products. Just remind us sort of what they are and how we should think about their impact in 2023. And my second question is, maybe just a comment on your trend in China, sort of what are you seeing there and maybe just the impact on Neurovascular, any color you could provide would be helpful? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Okay. There\u2019s a few questions in there. So I will do the super cycle and then I will pass it to Jason for China. On the super cycle, so System 9, our new power tool and Instruments launched just at the end of last year. So we are going to see the first real year of impact here in 2023, initial feedback, extremely positive. We know how to do these. As you know, we have -- from System 6 to 7 to 8 to now 9. So that\u2019s one of the flagship product. We have the 78 camera in Endoscopy that will be initially launched in Q2. We will probably see more of a pickup in Q3, Q4, but a fabulous new camera, which, as you know, we have done in the past, whether it\u2019s 14, 15, 88, 68. So these are things we know how to do and these are fabulous products. We have Neptune S, which is a small footprint Neptune product designed really for GI that is terrific new market for us. So we -- today Neptune\u2019s are not really being used in GI. It\u2019s designed special purpose for that to catch the polyps. Nurses are going to absolutely love this. We actually believe it could increase the procedures that they can do in a day, which, of course, the GI teams are going to love. So that\u2019s also another really powerful product that we are excited about. Towards the end of the year and won\u2019t have a big impact in 2023, but certainly much more in 2024 is going to be a new defibrillator. It will be in 2023 outside the United States and then early in 2024 inside the United States, which is the big pre-hospital expensive, complex life pack defibrillator. So that -- those are three big flagship products that\u2019s very rare to have them all within kind of an 18-month period. That\u2019s a super cycle. But beyond that, obviously, Insignia product is going to continue to launch. We have the CD Next product, which allows for depth perception as you are drilling. We have Signature 2 in the -- which is launched just this year, which is going to have a full effect next year in neurocranial, which is for neuro power drills. And I could list another whole bunch of foot and ankle products. We have got products in the shoulder space. So it -- there\u2019s a full, full list of products. But those big ones I mentioned are that\u2019s what I call it a super cycle is, you normally have one of those every two years or three years, not all in a short compressed timeframe. You have got the ProCuity bed that\u2019s continuing to get rave reviews and that\u2019s kind of still in the early phases of its launch. So, as healthy as I have had in my time here at Stryker in terms of new product cadence. On China? Jason Beach : Yeah. Vic, as it relates to China, as you all know, right, China, as it relates to total Stryker less than 2% of our sales. So even as you consider some of the lockdowns and things in 2022, immaterial to our results in terms of Q4. Then as you think about 2023, early days as it relates to Neurovascular VBP. We are certainly keeping an eye on that and as we think about Q1 and the full year of 2023, when we get to the next earnings call, if there\u2019s anything material to disclose, we will certainly do it at that time. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. You may proceed. Matt Miksic : Yeah. I just wanted to maybe get a sense and I know we could spend a lot of time talking about the many things that are going well and could go really well this year. But just a follow-up on Spine, the investment in the robot is significant, the portability of that hardware and upgrading the app, as you described, Kevin, is great. Between now and then, whether it\u2019s Q Guidance or whether it\u2019s implant launches or system launches or investments that you are making, can you talk about maybe anything that you would see as kind of gradually driving up momentum in that business as you head into -- as you get into that introduction of the robot next year? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Matt. So, certainly, we can\u2019t just wait only for Mako and I\u2019d tell you that Q Guidance has actually exceeded our expectations. Customer feedback has been excellent on that and the sales of those systems have been terrific. We also have a bunch of distribution deals that we have entered into for expandables, for different products, so two or three of those. We have the Monterey new product as well with Tritanium, which is pretty exciting. So it\u2019s -- we do have a, what we will call it a cadence of new products planned that will be either developed by Stryker or through distribution to help fill product gaps. I am pretty excited we have our sports medicine leader, Andy Hamel, who\u2019s the Head of R&D, has moved over to Spine. And if you look at the last decade, our sports business was the fastest launcher of products across all of Stryker and I think he will give that team a big shot in the arm. He moved over kind of midway through last year and excited to have him as part of the team. As you know, we have made other changes within our management team and I am pretty bullish on their prospects for the future. So we won\u2019t sit on our hands and just wait. And already, some of those products, even the Life Spine distribution deal, those kind of products are really helping that, I was at the Spine Sales Kickoff meeting for the year. The momentum is really strong. The teams are feeling good about the future and knowing that Makos coming, of course, helps a lot. But, yeah, it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s a tough market, as you know, and it has been a tough market for a long time. But I feel like the combination of this distribution filled we will call gap-filling products, as well as some new products that we have planned, should put us in a pretty good position even prior to the launch. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s excellent. Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : No problem. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Pito Chickering : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys hear me? Kevin Lobo : Yes. We can. Glenn Boehnlein : We can. Kevin Lobo : Thank you, Pito. Pito Chickering : All right. Great. So pre-COVID, the first quarter is about 23% of the annualized EPS. So with the commentary on no EPS growth for first quarter 2023, it looks like you guided about 20% of annual EPS. I understand the hard inflationary comps in 1Q, but why should 1Q be underweight the annual EPS number versus recovered years or should we take this as just back half margin expansion for 2023? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I think you are astute in your numbers. Definitely, it will be back half margin expansion for 2023. So you are right, we will see relative flat EPS in the first quarter, and then obviously, meaningful expansion starting in Q2, but really accelerating in Q3 and Q4 to drive to the EPS that we guided. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then just a quick one here on capital outlook, your commentary is very bullish. Can you just quantify us what the new orders in fourth quarter of 2022 were and how it compared to the fourth quarter 2021? Thanks so much. Jason Beach : Hey, Pito. It\u2019s Jason. We won\u2019t quantify in terms of what we have from an order book perspective. But I would just point back to, I think, what Glenn said earlier around and maybe it was Kevin. But the order book, as we exited 2022 is even larger than when we exited 2021. So we continue to be quite bullish on the capital side as we enter the New Year. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. And that\u2019s not a new commentary. So the last four months, I think, our commentary has been very consistent on capital. Our hospitals having challenges with their P&L and in some cases, sure, it\u2019s not yet -- we are not seeing it in orders. We are not seeing any cancellation of orders. Are some projects being delayed here and there? Sure. But it really is not having any kind of material impact on our outlook for capital. Again, a lot of our capital is revenue-producing type of capital. So you wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of slowdown. But even the large capital area, if I look at our communications business within Endoscopy, had a fantastic year, helped drive some of the Endoscopy growth and they have a terrific order book going into next year and that\u2019s large capital that sometimes in prior recessionary cycles have been deferred. So we just aren\u2019t seeing it yet. So that gives us optimism to kind of lean in on the growth for at least for 2023. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Okay. Great. Just on growth in the quarter, one of the factors you pointed to, Kevin, was procedural volume recovery. One of the factors discussed, obviously, throughout 2022 on in terms of capturing those procedures was hospital staffing. Are you starting to see an easing of that factor, any color you are seeing in terms of that here in the U.S. would be helpful? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Look, there are flashpoints where you do see staffing as a challenge, but the hospital systems are getting better at dealing with it. And we saw through from September through to the end of the year, kind of a nice building of procedure and a steady kind of high volume. The demand is clearly there. There\u2019s no question that there\u2019s some pent-up demand and surgeons are booked out for a good three months, four months in general. And so we are seeing, I would call it, a nice, steady kind of improving trend and I think we will see a moderate tailwind throughout the rest of this year. These flashpoints tend to be very short and even in some of the -- if you look in Europe and some of the areas that had strikes and real causes for worry, they have kind of come and gone pretty quickly. And so we are feeling good about the outlook on a procedure standpoint and expect this to be a tailwind throughout the year. Steven Lichtman : Got it. Great. And then, Glenn, just real quickly, I know you don\u2019t want to provide specific margin guidance. But relative to inflation, did you call out or could you talk about what the impact was to gross margin in 2022 from inflationary headwinds and generally either directionally or specifically what you are looking for in 2023 on that front? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I think as you think about inflation, obviously, we felt the impact of the inflation numbers in the -- that were in Q3, especially that were very large. A moderation of that, I would say, occurred in Q4. But keep in mind, to the extent that we purchased raw materials or made inventory, those inflated raw material prices, that\u2019s capitalized in our inventory. The other place that we will feel inflation and that it carries over to in this year is really going to be labor costs that went up that are baked in now solidly for the year. We are still experiencing a pretty high inflation in our freight and transportation costs. Energy costs, especially in Europe, now have inflation baked into them, we will feel it there. I think what we are thinking, though, is we are not -- as we look at 2023, that we are not thinking that inflation will continue to be at the levels that it was showing in 2022. So we are feeling that, that will moderate and that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our guidance. Steven Lichtman : Sure. Understood. Thanks, guys. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Drew Ranieri : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, just for you to start. You have -- we have talked about the capital order book being stronger year-over-year. But can you maybe talk a little bit more specifically of what you are seeing in the hospital versus in the ASC setting? Any noticeable trends in -- even in procedures in the ASC as you are entering 2023? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. So, clearly, this trend towards procedures being shifted to the ASC is continuing. It really accelerated during the pandemic, but there\u2019s no signs of that slowing down. Even if I look at our Mako installations, I would say, this year, it\u2019s a record number in the ASC setting. So as procedures move to the ASC, they certainly want to use great technology and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to slow down. We are going to -- every hospital system you talk to has construction plans around ASCs and so I think that\u2019s just an undeniable future trend. Obviously, that takes -- it will take time to build out more and more capacity, but we saw that increase in Q4 versus Q3, which increased versus Q2. So it\u2019s just a steady gradual trend and I am talking mostly about hip and knee replacements, but we are also seeing even some spine procedures being done in the surgery centers to shoulders. And I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any slowdown, it\u2019s just going to continue over the next few years. Drew Ranieri : Got it. And then just for Glenn, you talked about the margin expansion for 2023. Could you maybe just highlight kind of what you are expecting for free cash flow generation, 2022 is obviously a tough year? It sounds like inventory will get better in the back half, but just any broad-based thoughts on free cash flow for 2023? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I think as you think about the biggest contributor to cash flow, honestly, it\u2019s earnings. So as we see progressive improvement in earnings throughout the year, I think, we will see that carry over into cash flow. There are some things that were maybe one-offs that we felt that we hope will get better in 2023. That bolus of AR that we had at the end of the year in 2022, obviously, we will collect that and kind of get back to a regular cadence of DSO. And then, finally, as inventory costs moderate and we feel more confident about supply, we will draw down on some of the safety stocks that we had pre-buy. We will also see just lower cost of inventory in raw materials and that should carry over to cash flow, too. And then the other area that I would highlight that maybe doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention is, we continue to work on our AP and AP days, and we have made incredible improvements over the past two years to three years in terms of working with vendors and pushing AP out to beyond 70 days and we will continue to work on that as well. So I think all of that bodes well for cash flow improvement. But generally, I think, what you will see is as you see progressive improvement in earnings. You will also see cash flow fall out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed. Michael Matson : Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess I want to ask one on M&A. So I think you called out that you would be looking to do some more tuck-ins. What are you seeing out there with regard to the valuation expectations from potential targets? It seems like there was -- in the past year, there\u2019s been sort of a disconnect between what the buyers are willing to pay and what the sellers want. I mean is that starting to get more realistic now and just maybe you can just comment generally what you are seeing there in terms of deal flow? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. But there\u2019s, obviously, the stock market reaction over the last year on companies that weren\u2019t making profits was pretty harsh. And it takes time for that, let\u2019s call it, a new reality to set in with people that want to sell. But as a company that is acquisitive and has been acquisitive over time. This could bode well for us over the next couple of years if valuations kind of stay at this level. Obviously, the tuck-ins that -- a lot of the tuck-ins we do tend to be private companies, not necessarily publicly traded companies. But we have an active list of companies that we look at. We are focused also on paying down debt, given that we took on a lot of debt for Wright Medical and Vocera, so that\u2019s kind of job one. Let\u2019s continue to keep paying down that term loan. We still have about $850 million left on the term loan. We want to pay that down. But if we see good opportunities and there of the tuck-in nature, we aren\u2019t going to wait, we will make sure we do that. We can do two things at the same time and continue to pay down debt, but also do some small tuck-ins. And so the divisions are actively pursuing those and we will be ready to strike if the prices are right. But I think this pricing environment is going to be positive. Now profits do matter and there was sort of a period of time where a lot of companies run away from us, to be honest, just on valuation, given that they were growing fast and the valuations were just out of sight. And we just won\u2019t pay just whatever for something, even if we like the technology, we have to make sure it\u2019s going to meet financial returns. So thanks for the question. We will continue to look and sort of thread the needle between paying down the debt and then being opportunistic where we can. Michael Matson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our following question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. You may proceed. Joanne Wuensch : There is a moment when you were rattling off, rattling maybe the wrong word, all the different growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnoology. And I could not get my head around some of these numbers and I am just sort of curious and maybe this has been addressed. How did this happen? Was this some level of pent-up demand in the capital equipment cycle, was it just the end of the year people have money in their budgets may want let go. Help me understand what this is and do you expect there to be more of a depleted effort in the beginning of this year? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Look, Joanne, one of the great news about this quarter. First of all, it felt like a pre-pandemic record quarter is the way I describe it, where our sales teams were kind of firing the way they normally do at Stryker. You have seen in the past and you have been covering us for some time. Having a big fourth quarter is not new for Stryker. We have had big fourth quarters many, many, many times. Our teams know how to finish. They chase their numbers. Our hospitals also kind of want to use up some of their budgets if they are on -- depending on their calendar cycle that they are on. And so that\u2019s not new. What\u2019s really exciting is that we were able to dig out of some of the backlog, specifically in medical, but not deplete. These are not pull-forward sales. We still have strong orders. We still have a growth momentum that\u2019s going to continue next year and that\u2019s why you saw such a, I would say, positive guide on organic sales growth. We are not calling for a soft Q1, and I think, Glenn even in the Q&A mentioned that we are not calling for a soft topline in Q1. Our implant businesses are continuing to hum. And these businesses are just their special businesses. We have these dedicated business units. We have split them many times. If I look at within Instruments, Instruments had 10% organic growth in 2022 and that\u2019s because we decided to split orthopedic instruments and circular technologies a few years ago and they are both growing extremely well. They both have new products, right? We have a new Neptune and we have a new power tool. In the old days, it was the same rep trying to sell both of those. Now we have different reps selling them. So our ability to scale those launches is so much better with specialization and dedication. That\u2019s kind of our formula, our growth formula and that\u2019s just -- it\u2019s absolutely happening in our company. So our leadership teams are terrific. Our dedicated e-business units are firing and the products are flowing. So I expect more of the same. But if you look back, even going back to 2016 as I mentioned before, and if you look at the kind of organic growth, it\u2019s of these three divisions, Instruments and Ortho and Medical, not to mention Neurocranial, which has been an absolute home run, right? And that\u2019s really run by instruments, but we report it separately. They are growing every year, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%. That\u2019s not unusual. And now that they have -- when you have new product launches that tends to be on the higher side of it. So, yeah, it\u2019s a good point to be a Stryker right now, especially in those businesses. Joanne Wuensch : If I may, you do discuss new product cycle a couple of times. You have got a new power tool. You have got a new Neptune. What else would you like to highlight? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. I mentioned before the camera, so in Endoscopy, a new camera. That\u2019s big sort of blockbuster flagship product. Sports Medicine has a number of new shoulder products that they are launching. Those are -- but that sort of helps fill out the bag. At the end of the year, we have the new defibrillator within our Emergency Care business. They launched a new -- I didn\u2019t even mention they launched a new power chair at the beginning of this year. So if you want to go up in these apartment buildings, we now have a powered chair, which is fabulous. It\u2019s called Expedition. I didn\u2019t even mention that one. I mean it\u2019s just -- there\u2019s no end. I mean we have invested pretty heavily in R&D over the past four years, five years, six years, seven years and spending close to 7% of sales and the new products are flowing. So those are -- I mentioned a couple of other ones before, Joanne, but that hopefully is a good look for you. Joanne Wuensch : It is. Thank you so much. Kevin Lobo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Anderson with Cowen. Please proceed. Eric Anderson : Hi. This is Eric on for Josh. Can you guys hear me? Kevin Lobo : Yes. We can. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Eric Anderson : Excellent. Maybe thinking about cementless knees. I think about half of your knees are now going in cementless, correct me if I am wrong there. Where do you think that rate could be exiting 2023 and then maybe thinking longer term, what portion of your needs do you think will ultimately be cementless? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. So we -- we have now -- we exited the year over 50% in the U.S. on our knees being cementless. The rate does vary in other countries of the world, but it\u2019s been a steady climb, frankly. They are going to be more conservative on cementless than hips just because it\u2019s weight-bearing versus hips. And do I think it will get to close to 100 like hips? Probably not, just because of bone quality, because it\u2019s weight-bearing. But we have not seen a slowdown. It\u2019s been just this kind of steady march. If you recall a few years ago, it was kind of 30%, then it moved up to 40%, now it\u2019s north of 50% now and I think you will just continue to see that kind of steady climb. Where we will end, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to predict, but probably somewhere in the 70%s is kind of what I would -- I think it will. So there\u2019s still room to run on cementless, and obviously, we have a proven system that\u2019s delivering terrific long-term results, given that we have done 1 million of them already. Eric Anderson : Understood. Thanks for that. And apologies if I missed it, but are there any selling day impacts in 2023 that we need to consider? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. There\u2019s one extra selling day, one less selling day in Q3. But for the full year, it\u2019s the same number of days. Eric Anderson : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Eric Fleming with Raymond James. You may proceed. Eric Fleming : Hey, guys. Eric on for Jayson from Raymond James. A quick question on your pricing outlook, are there any segments that have a particular impact or is it across all? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. The -- obviously, the segment that has the biggest impact is really our MedSurg businesses. We saw Q4 pretty much all positive pricing impacts across MedSurg and so we expect that to continue into 2023. I mean that being said, on the Ortho side, there\u2019s a lot of work around contracts and structures and rebates, and so we are seeing good momentum there as well on pricing. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that, pricing is legacy product over legacy product and so to the extent that we have these product launches, like Kevin was talking about, we generally will launch with premium pricing over the legacy product, but it won\u2019t be included in that pricing statistic. It really gets included in volume. So net-net, I think, you will see probably more favorable pricing coming out of the MedSurg businesses, but we are making great progress on the Ortho side, too. Operator : Thank you so much. There are no further questions. I will now pass it back over to Kevin Lobo for concluding remarks. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Great. So, first of all, I want to thank all of you for your patience working through our technical challenges. As you can see, we had a terrific finish to last year, a really good start this year and had a chance to be out with our sales teams across Stryker and I could tell you the momentum is palpable. It feels like it\u2019s going to be a strong year. We, obviously, have -- are going to continue to have some challenges around spotting this in the supply chain, but it certainly feels like the worst is behind us as we experienced last year. So I want to thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Todd and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release, that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before opening the call to Q&A. In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.6% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. Our international business continues to be a growth engine with strong results in all countries other than China, which had negative growth due to COVID and volume-based procurement. We are also seeing good traction with our pricing initiatives, delivering positive pricing overall in the first quarter. Importantly, we have begun to realize the gradual improvement of component availability and lessened supply chain constraints. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.14, reflecting 8.6% growth compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by our strong sales performance. With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, coming off a year with almost 10% organic sales growth. This continued sales momentum is a testament to our team's strong execution. We are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share to $10.5 a share to $10.25 a share. I remain pleased with our ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 13th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. I would like to thank our leaders for maintaining our positive culture through the significant growth that we have experienced over this period of time. In addition, we recently published our third annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitment and disclosures on our three pillars of corporate responsibility, stronger people, healthier planet, and good business. In July, we will share our virtual corporate responsibility roundtable with leaders from across the organization, bringing to life our progress and how these three pillars tied to our mission. Finally, we will be holding an Investor Day on November 8th in Mahwah, New Jersey. We will provide more details about this event in the coming months. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, product launches, updates on Mako and acquisitions. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the first quarter in most countries. As a reminder, Q1 of 2022 had softer volumes in many markets because of COVID related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures continue in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q4 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy, and Instruments divisions. Our capital order book remains strong as we head into Q2. Our product super cycle is underway and driving positive momentum. This began in late 2022 with the US launch of our System 9 power tools, which gained momentum in the quarter and is getting great customer feedback regarding ergonomics and quality. In mid-Q1, we launched the Neptune S waste management system. We've seen significant trialing already with positive customer feedback related to workflow advantages and environmental benefits. Also, some of our other launches this year, include the Xpedition powered stair chair, Mako 2.0 software for knees, Q Guidance for cranial procedures, and the Insignia Hip Stem pacing to be on track for 85% launched by year-end. Finally, we received 510(k) clearance on our 1788 Camera platform which will expand our Endoscopy's division addressable market in the new procedures, including the ability to visualize lung and other cancers. As a reminder, the launch of the 1788 Camera is set for late Q2. We continue to see steady progress with these launches and expect them to be a tailwind for growth in the coming quarters and years. Next, the progress of our Mako offense has resulted in continued growth of our installed base combined with high utilization rates. In the US, we realized strength in our rental contracts which resulted in lower upfront revenue for the quarter. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and our offering flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. Our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, is now included in our organic growth beginning in February of this year. Our expectation that sales will accelerate beginning in Q2 of this year remains unchanged. We will provide our next update on Vocera when we report our full year 2023 results. Lastly, we have obtained regulatory clearance regarding our acquisition of Cerus Endovascular and we expect the deal will close shortly. With that I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.6% in the quarter. The first quarter of 2023 had one more selling day than 2022, which is approximately a 1% benefit. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our US MedSurg businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 2.2% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, US organic sales growth was 12.6%. International organic sales growth was 16.6% impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.14 in the quarter was up 8.6% from 2022, driven by higher sales and a favorable adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.06. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 13.1%, with organic sales growth of 12.4%, which included 12.1% of US organic growth and 13.3% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 8.9% led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management, and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 16.2% driven by strong growth across most of its major businesses. The growth was highlighted by general surgery, sports medicine, sustainability, communications, and ProCare products. Medical had US organic sales growth of 13.2% reflecting solid performances across our acute care, emergency care, and Sage businesses and benefiting from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our US Neurovascular business returned to growth with organic sales growth of 7.3%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. The US Neurocranial business had organic sales growth of 9.1%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, Bipolar Forceps and Max Space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 13.3% reflecting double-digit growth in almost all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 15.1% with organic sales growth of 15.2% which included organic growth of 13.3% in the US and 20.3% internationally. Our US Hip business grew 16.2% organically reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our US Knee business grew 20.7% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in a robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our US Trauma and Extremities business grew 13.7% organically with strong performance across all three businesses. Our US Spine business grew 6.3% led by the performance in our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our US Other Ortho declined organically by 14.8% primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 20.3% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was unfavorable approximately 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting the impact of increased manufacturing and supply chain costs driven by inflationary pressures, somewhat offset by price and volume increases. Sequentially and compared to Q4 2022, we have improved our adjusted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points driven by mix, price decreases in spot prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which represents a 70 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher comparable in 2022, which related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 35.6% of sales, which was 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to normalization of sales force expansion and meetings. In summary for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.1% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the first quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $65 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022 mainly driven by a one-time benefit in 2022. The first quarter of 2023 had an effective tax rate of 12.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items, including stock compensation. For 2023, we now expect full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13.1 billion, approximately $100 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $445 million. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections in the first quarter. Considering our first quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9%, with pricing to be relatively neutral for the year. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipated sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year being more negative in the first half of the year. This is included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first quarter together with our strong sales momentum and further progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year, we now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.05 to $10.25. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a really impressive start to the year here. Kevin, I guess, I would just love to start with the growth rates we saw in Q1 in some of your businesses like both in Ortho and MedSurge. What in your view is, was there anything here that was a one-time here and what do you see that sustainable? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, thanks, Larry for the question. You saw we had a great fourth quarter of sales growth, another great quarter. This quarter of sales growth. We did benefit from some softer comparisons given that Omicron was present in a lot of markets last year. But I would tell you that the procedures are really ramping very nicely and they have been really since the second half of last year, that's continued, and the capital demand remains strong. So we really have strength kind of across the portfolio of our company and that's what gives us the optimism to raise our full year guide. Lawrence Biegelsen : So let me just follow up maybe for Glenn. If I'm doing the math right here, you raised the guidance by about 70 basis points to 80 basis points at the midpoint. The Q2 to Q4 organic growth, Glenn, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it implies about 7% at the midpoint. Is that close and kind of how are you thinking about the why the deceleration I guess and how -- and any color on the quarterly cadence from here? Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, Larry. I will trust your math. The one thing I will say is that, as Kevin mentioned, Q1 maybe had a little bit of a softer comparable. Moving forward, we're going to see stronger comparables. And right now, we're still in the first quarter. So we're anxious and excited about how the businesses are performing, but we're still mindful of the environment that we're in and so we feel like this is a strong guide and imply solid performance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. I'll also add my congratulations on a really impressive quarter here. Maybe I had to focus in Ortho. I was kind of blown away by how good the growth rates were in hip, knee, and extremity. Would love to get a little more color on exactly what you're seeing there, how much the anterior hip stem is helping you in hip? What's going on in knee and any color you could give on the Trauma and Extremities business and what's driving the trends there? Kevin Lobo : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Robbie. I would tell you that the knee performance is just a continuation of what you've seen for the past three or four years where all the Mako growth, the cementless growth, continues to fuel market leading growth. So that's not a new story. Some of the numbers OUS were pretty breathtaking. But part of that was due to softer comparables and part of that's due to really picking up Mako installations OUS. It continue to be strong in the US, but OUS has a much longer runway and started much later as you know. And so Mako will fuel that OUS growth in the same way that it's fueled our US growth for many years. So that's the knee part. On Hip, it's really a combination of the Insignia stem as well as Mako. The 4.0 software was launched within two years, in the last two years, that combined with Insignia really positions us beautifully for direct anterior and we really like the momentum that we're seeing in hips and we expect that to continue. Trauma and extremities has been a -- just a great story. The Wright Medical deal has turned out spectacularly well. The upper extremities business is absolutely on fire, the market leading business and grew very strong double-digit growth. And as well foot and ankle is really starting to pick up steam and had a very strong performance. So really all three of those Trauma and Extremities businesses, including Core Trauma had strong performances and the outlook for those businesses continues to be very positive. Robert Marcus : Maybe as a follow-up, Medical came in another really good quarter there ProCuity launch continued strong. We heard one of your competitors, particularly in the Bed Market talk about a weaker capital environment. So is that something you're seeing in some of the less revenue generating capital equipment items and any color you could give specifically in Medical and how the Beds are going. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, so far, we're still seeing very strong orders for all of our capital equipment businesses, large capital, small capital. We still have healthy order books across the board. There is a bit of noise here now that you hear from some hospitals saying while they're starting to think about capital, but we're not seeing it in our order book at least not yet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening and thank you for taking the question and quite a nice quarter and I'm going to agree with some of the growth rate in hips and knees, particularly in the US were quite strong. I just want to take out picture a few things. Can you give us an update on where you think you are in the ASC and I'll throw in my follow-up now on updated thoughts on use of cash? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. The ASC joint continues its trend that we've been seeing for some time, continued progression in both hips and knees. We're now in double-digit penetration in both hips and knee little bit more knees, but both continuing I call it a steady progression and I don't think that will slow down. I think that will just continue over the next few years with the expansion into ASCs with construction projects with more and more procedures moving out and we're even starting to see some of the extremity procedures move out even some spine procedures. So it's a trend that will continue, but it's not something that's going to ramp exponentially because it's gated by construction and building out of new ORs. So it just takes time. And then the second question was on? Jason Beach : Cash flow? Glenn Boehnlein : Use of cash. Joanne Wuensch : Well, use of call. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure, Joanne. I mean, it was honestly a strong quarter for cash flow for us, coming in at $445 million. I will tell you that we benefited from elevated receivable levels as we exited Q4 last year. As we think about sort of the priorities for cash flow, we really haven't changed, sort of how we think about first of all, we want to focus on paying down the term loan. We paid $100 million in Q1. The remaining balance of $750 million we will plan on paying-off during this year. We're also seeing. We're closing on Cerus Medical. That will happen fairly shortly here. And so we are allocating some cash to M&A. Teams are still working and we're still being fairly choosy in terms of looking at opportunities and making sure we're lining up things for when cash flow frees up a little. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really strong start here. Kevin, maybe my first question here on the performance here on the Ortho side. I guess there's a lot of moving parts. Is this -- there some thoughts on perhaps we're seeing a pull-forward of demand and recessionary fears as against the counter to that is share gain, given the new product momentum versus perhaps some of the backlog being here. Can you just lay out the different pieces here and what is happening in Ortho markets from Stryker's perspective. And related to that I'm curious on smart implants where Stryker on smart implants, given we just had an NTAP in that space. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions in there, Vijay. So let me start first by saying that there really isn't a new story, right? The knee business continues its strong performance. The hip business, as we said, once we get into the Insignia Stem launch, we're going to start to be able to grow above market when you combine it with Mako and with the right combine it with Stryker, we have just an incredibly strong position in Trauma and Extremities. We just executed extremely well. The market is better and we said that there was going to be a tailwind. There's no new news there. There is a tailwind. I don't think it's pull forward. I think you're going to see that tailwind last we said six quarters was our estimate. So this is the first of six quarters where you're seeing that tailwind. Keep in mind. The comps are part of the story, not just for Stryker, for the entire market. The comps were affected by COVID in the prior year. And so you're going to see an elevated market growth this quarter. But I do believe the tailwind will continue into second quarter, third quarter, again, a moderate tailwind, but our ability to take advantage of our product flow and of course our sales force execution is something that I don't see changing. I think we'll continue to be able to perform very well relative to the market and the market is going to be a little bit more elevated. And then the smart implant. So, no, we don't have any current plans for smart implant. We do have the motion sense that we've launched, which is a wearable that measures both on the femur and the tibia. And so we're an unlimited launch on that. And that is a way to make sure that you can monitor post-operatively all the types of measures that you would be thinking about after the procedure. So that's our approach versus having it implanted in the body. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful commentary, Kevin. Maybe one for Glenn here on gross margins in the quarter up sequentially. Glenn, how much of this is volume leverage given revenues came in you know above. I'm just thinking about fiscal '24 here. And again I'm not asking for guidance, but my understanding was Stryker is still seeing a lot of inflationary pressures here in '23. Most of it is the inventory flowing through the P&L, given pricing was positive and as inflationary impact a bit, how should we think about margin progression? Should we directionally be thinking of maybe perhaps above normal margin years for Stryker going forward? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. I mean, you know, first of all, we're pleased and we've made some incremental progress. And that's kind of why I wanted to call out sequentially as being maybe a little bit more important as you look at margin year-over-year. If you look at just sort of in just for the quarter, some of the big things are really price. We did see reduced spot buys. But keep in mind, we're still amortizing those 2022 spot buys. So that's going to hit us on into third quarter. We also as supply evened out, it just allowed our manufacturing to be a little more consistent and drive better efficiencies. And so we kind of got back on driving better manufacturing efficiencies. The other thing we're seeing is that freight rates are monitoring and we're seeing improvement in those rates. The other the couple pieces, I would say, mix was a bit of a tailwind. Obviously, if you think about Ortho and Spine and the kind of gross margins they drive versus MedSurge, that was a little bit of a tailwind. I think that will continue to be a little bit of a tailwind as the year progresses. We are still tempered in this environment, this inflationary environment, though. And so that will keep a tamper. We're early in the year, Vijay, and we're not thinking that we want to guide on gross margin yet. I think we see some daylight and we feel good about that. But it will be a work in progress as the whole year pushes forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to follow up a little bit on Larry's question on guidance. I share his math. As I look at the numbers, I think, you beat by a couple hundred million on the top line and kind of carry that through for the full year. And I think, Kevin, at Academy, you said you thought there would be a little bit of headwind on pricing. That might have just been an Ortho comment. But also staffing is getting better. So staffing better pricing seems like it's getting better. I think given where the stock was trading, people are expecting you to guide a little bit higher if you did beat. So why not guide a little bit higher for the full year or incrementally higher than the beat given what we're seeing in your markets and the supercycle just about to start? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Thanks. So first of all, I'd tell you that we started the year with a pretty good guide and obviously had a very strong quarter. And we raised and it's only one quarter the supply chain, to Glenn's point, there are still, let's call them brushfires happening all the time that we're having to tamp out. And there we are not completely out of the woods on supply chain issues, which can cause uncertainty. Launches have to actually occur on time and be able to deliver what we hope they can deliver. That creates uncertainty. We had roughly almost 10% organic sales growth last year with a monster Q4. And so there's a lot of reasons why, you know, let's just temper our enthusiasm. It was a great quarter. I'm very happy with it. But we've moved it up. Let's see how things play out over the next quarter or two quarters before we get ahead of ourselves. And you've seen us in the past. We're not afraid. We don't have to raise once for the full year if things go well in the future, if the launch is hit on the right time, if we're able to sustain this kind of price performance then we can think about raising. But it's a little too premature to do that right now. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. Makes sense. As a follow-up, Kevin. On Mako, I know more rentals. It just is because I look at the rest of the business on the capital side of things. You're not having any problem selling things. I know Mako is more expensive, but you've got [RAS] (ph) out there, you've got VELYS from J&J and now you're doing more rental contracts. So I guess the interpretation from most of the investors would be that, hey, they're seeing more pressure in terms of the ability to sell Mako. Is that fair or are we just not able to see that you're still capturing your fair share of Mako sales and placements within the marketplace? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Just to be clear, we are very bullish on the future of Mako, and we have been. And if you look at our hip and knee number, that's a pretty good indicator that a lot of our growth comes from accounts that had Makos installed. If the competitors offer things for free, that obviously causes the customer to say, do I need to pay something upfront. And we've always had rentals and financing within the mix of offerings. In the past, they would be much more inclined to purchase. They're now leaning much more towards rentals. And honestly I don't -- it doesn't bother me at all. And then Jason, any comments on rentals? Jason Beach : Yes. I think maybe just one additional comment relative to rentals. I think the thing to keep in mind is a large percentage of these rentals they'll flip to purchases, right? So it's not like they're going in and the units are coming back out. So, to Kevin's point, we feel really good about the Mako business. Kevin Lobo : What I'd say competitive pressures have caused a little bit of a shift in customer behavior. That doesn't concern us. We are winning at a very high rate. And the Makos that are being installed are being used at a very high rate. And that's, to me, what's critical. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for taking the questions. And let me add to everyone's sentiment. I want to ask the guidance. I think others are kind of getting that around the progression of quarters for the rest of the year. But if you look at the guidance on the top line relative to the growth in guidance on the bottom line, specifically for Glenn, I'm just curious. It's a little higher on the top line doesn't quite flow through. And if there's anything in there that maybe you're reinvesting in Glenn, that you want us to think about specific to the EPS growth at 8.6% relative to the top line. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. It's a good question, Ryan. I think first of all, if you look at sort of the midpoint of both guides, sales and EPS, we actually are starting to show leverage. So I think that's a positive direction. We're still very early in the year. And we are going to be mindful that we're still in, as Kevin referred to, somewhat volatile circumstances relative to supply chain, some other macroeconomic factors. And so that causes us to make sure that we're being smart about where we land in the guide. To that point, as we see the quarters play out over this year, if we see improvement, I think, we'll definitely feel compelled to take the guide up. Kevin Lobo : And we did have a little bit of a lower tax rate as you saw this quarter based on some discretes and stock comp and that's going -- we think start to get elevated over the next three quarters. So overall we really feel like we -- the guide is an appropriate lift both on the top and the bottom line. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. And then, Kevin, I'd love to get your perspective on the state of the spine market right now. There's obviously a lot of disruption, as you know. But NUVA Globus is progressing forward. As of right now, both parties voted to consummate that deal. Is there any disruption that you're able to capitalize on that we're seeing in your US spine numbers right now as they are starting to show some nice growth? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think it's too early right now for us to have really seen much in the way of disruption. I think the disruption will come once they start to bring the organizations together and decide which salespeople are calling on which surgeons and which products they're going to keep, et cetera. So there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption from both of the mergers that are just starting to happen in the space. I'm pleased about our Spine business momentum and it's really because of our own innovations. Some of the licensing deals that we've done, getting the Q guidance out, which is really getting very favorable attraction in enabling technologies. We've started to show our Mako Spine, which is also getting very, very good feedback, although that won't be launched until next year. But customers are warming up to that. So I think it's more about us focusing on our own business. And if we can bring the types of innovations that we need to the market, I think, we're going to continue to do well in Spine. Operator : Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hi there. This is Ken [Long] (ph) for Shagun Singh. Congrats on a nice quarter. Quick question on M&A. Can you talk about your appetite for M&A and remind us of the deal size that you would be willing to go for? And what respect the valuations you would look for as in the like what do you think about valuation right now? And then just for Kevin, can you call out interest -- like you've called out interest in our -- in five different adjacencies over the last couple of weeks in M&A. Can you talk about urology and women's health, the call point in that area? And if that makes sense for Stryker to have? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So let me start by saying that this year, to Glenn's previous remarks, we are focused on paying down debt and getting the term loan off the books. We are continuing to pursue what we call tuck-ins. And Cerus Endovascular is one of those tuck-ins, which we will close shortly. We have other tuck-ins that are in the works right now, and we'll see which ones of those happen this year. But this year is more of a year of tuck-in than it is doing billion type of deals. But as we get into next year, if we continue with the strong cash flow performance that we're currently experiencing, we will be back in the market for those larger size deals. The teams haven't slowed down their work. They're continuing to pursue discussions with many of our targets. Valuations are getting better, which is good. Interest rates are going up, which is bad. But on the overall basis, we think the market is still primed with many, many good targets. And we continue to believe that using our available cash for acquisitions as the first source of cash and the first use of our cash is the right strategy with Stryker is a key part of our growth formula. Specific to your question on women's health and urology, we do have a presence in urology with our Endoscopy division, and that is an interesting space that we'd like to build around over time. We do have some women's health presence also, a combination of part of the Instruments division as well as our Endoscopy division is present right now within breast care. So these are not markets where we're sort of absent, but we're already present to some degree. And if we could get a larger presence, that would be something that is one of many, as you mentioned, many adjacencies that we're looking at. And I think that's all I'll say for this earnings call. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Eric Anderson : Hi. This is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on your Mako shoulder and spine applications. I know we're still a ways off from commercial launch there. But could you just talk about the next steps in terms of development and the regulatory processes there? Are there any milestones that we should have on our radar for those applications? And the follow-up would just be on, are you able to share what sort of submission those applications would be to get clearance? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, we're not going to get into all the details of the launch or specific milestones. Suffice to say that we are still very much on track with the time lines that we laid out last quarter. No change and continued really positive feedback from customers that we are exposing to the technology. We feel the regulatory path has gotten more certain, which is why we never provided dates prior because we weren't as confident on the regulatory path. These are complex launches. If something changes, we'll let you know. But right now, everything remains on track as per the last discussion we had. Eric Anderson : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matt Miksic : Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question and I have to say, I'm not sure that congrats on the quarter quite adequately covers these numbers. I mean they're really just out of balance, I guess, in terms of these end markets. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could. It looks -- just looking at US knees kind of as one line item. It looks like you accelerated on -- obviously, just year-over-year, but also on a two-year stack basis into the first quarter. And just thinking about the drivers there and how sustainable they are. You obviously had a big leading market in robotics. We all know how that has worked out. Wondering if you could talk about how you feel about the lead you have in ASPs, and whether this could shape up to be kind of a similar long-term driver? And then just also on that subject, rentals came up earlier. I'm wondering what -- to what degree this rentals are really showing up more in the ASPs? I know there's a couple of questions in there, but I do have one follow-up on MedSurg, if I could. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. Thank you. Yes, we have a very significant lead in robotics. We have a significant lead in cementless, and we have a significant lead in the ASC. So we have all three of those factors are at play and contributing to strong performance. And you are right, in the ASC, they tend to shift much more towards rentals or let's call it, forms of financing that -- because there's always physician ownership as part of these deals, and they don't have the capital budget that hospitals do to make a purchase, so they do prefer financing. And so you'll continue to see that with ASCs much more of a shift towards rentals. And we're seeing with ASC's strong demand for Mako, which is really exciting for us. And so if there's a there OR orthopedic ASC, usually, at least one of those will have a Mako in them. And that our offense plays very well for that given all the other technology we can provide for the ASC. So those -- I would say all three of those factors are really at play having significant leads across those three tenants. Matt Miksic : That's super helpful. Thank you for the color. And then on MedSurg, just specifically, your back order, your order condition as they're sort of stable. I'm wondering, have you started to see some of the back orders specifically start to move or accelerate or thoughts and timing on that? And then the factors you mentioned still expecting Vocera to accelerate. Maybe just an update on some of the factors that you're expecting to drive that acceleration? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So back -- if you think about medical, medical is going to have another very strong year this year. Even though you saw a boomer in the fourth quarter, I did signal that medical will still have another strong year. They have the largest backlog of all the divisions of our company right now and that's across emergency care as well as acute care. The largest is within medical. And so we're still fighting the supply chain is getting better every month, but it's still not easy. Out there in the supply chain for medical, and then the other capital businesses follow behind medical. So still a very, very strong order book. And what was the second? And on Vocera, yes, we're really pleased. We predicted this, right? If you go back to second quarter of last year, we said -- we're going through some disruption or making changes to the way that we go to market and in the commercial model. We're pushing much more towards the cloud. So very intentional decisions and things have played out basically as we thought. Their orders are also -- have also picked up pretty meaningfully. And we do expect to see an acceleration starting in Q2 based on the orders we already have in the system. We know that, that's going to start to be a nice contributor. And then given how much we pay for Vocera, we will provide some more metrics on that at the end of the year, and we plan to probably do that on an annual basis as we do with Mako. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess and congrats on another quarter as well. I wanted to break down Q1 a bit more. A lot of companies have mentioned January was really the strong month where there was a comp benefit. So curious how you saw February and March shape up and even April. And I heard you say procedures were ramping over the quarter. So that implies April even kind of better in February and March. Just any kind of color you can give on the shape of the quarter and how things are trending across the different businesses would be helpful? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I'd say January and February are both very strong versus prior year because they were -- those two months were more affected. Last year, March was a little bit, let's say, more muted than the first two months. And then I would say April has continued at good levels. So when I say ramping, it was really sort of over last year's fourth quarter into this year's first quarter, April continues to be strong. Just these elevated procedure levels are not that different between January, February, March or April. It's just more about what the comparators were in the prior period. But continue to expect good volumes overall. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. And then -- and Glenn, maybe touch a bit more on the margins. If you can help quantify some of the supply chain purchasing improvements we've seen so far [Technical Difficulty] but just come from the higher costs rolling off. And then maybe longer term, the path back to the -- is there a path back to the 2019 gross and operating margins? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, sure. A couple of things. Like as we think about spot buys just in absolute dollar terms, we had a significantly less amount of purchases through that spot buy channel in Q1. And so we know that as we see 2022 impact amortize off, we're not really adding to that. So I do know that, that will give us a little bit of lift in the back half of the year. I also think mix is helpful as Ortho procedures continue to ramp, as Kevin mentioned. The other big thing will be these new product launches. We usually gain price on these sort of next-gen products that we put out there. And while that's not specifically in the price component that we quote, it definitely will help margin. In terms of the path back to 2019, that is a question that we get fairly frequently. I would tell you that we're hyper focused on regaining sort of our position on gross margin, obviously, going after that by being as aggressive as we can on price and putting in really good programs that will help on the price side. We're seeing improved manufacturing efficiencies in other areas, which also are going to drive. I don't foresee that, that would happen this year. But that, beyond this year, we definitely are focused on what the pathway would be back to that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Congratulations, guys. I guess, Kevin, tracking comps over the past three years, obviously, has been a challenge. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on where you think underlying volume growth is for the joint recon market now. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think if you go back to 2019 and call that the last normal year that we've had. I would say we are fully backed to 2019 and actually growing from that. So you're right, it's very difficult to look at comps. You've got -- just look at last year, you have to look at how it was last year versus the year before. So it has been very tricky, to your point. But I think we're now in a kind of post-pandemic world. Even though we do have staffing shortages here and there, the surgeons are as busy as they've ever been. If they had sometimes some more stuff, I think you do even more. But I would say we're in a very good position in the market. There's healthy demand. Hospitals are learning how to get more procedures done. And so I would say we're fully back to the 2019 in most parts of the world. Maybe China is a little different. Outside of China, everything else is kind of fully back and building kind of what I'll call a normal growth rate off of being fully back. And of course there is pent-up demand. Steven Lichtman : Right. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. You talked about the pricing actions last quarter, and obviously, those have kicked in, as you noted, particularly in Orthopedics, a nice step. What is the sustainability of that sort of level of pricing you're able to hold here this year, particularly in Orthopedics? Is this something that we could see sort of steadily fold in over the next few years? Is there some kind of catch-up this year that we maybe shouldn't count on as we look beyond? Any sort of color on that would be helpful. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. I mean, first off, we're super excited that these pricing programs that we put in place last year are really starting to take hold and we're seeing an impact. MSNT continues to perform fairly positive. I would expect that they'll continue to perform at a positive or near positive level throughout the full year. Ortho is a little bit more complex. It's heavily driven by contracts. The impact of pricing can vary depending on the anniversary of those contracts. So really going after Ortho and just trying to manage that to be a little less negative. And then as you look at that price that we put out, it's impacted by mix. These product introductions are going to impact that. And I would say that all of these factors kind of go into where our forecast was that, yes, Q1 was great. But as we anniversary these pricing programs, as we see new products come out, we're going to see a little moderation of the impact of that price and that's where we're holding right now as the year progresses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise : Good afternoon. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Glenn, I want to ask for a little more color, if we could, on SG&A. I know you're reluctant to get into forecasting or talking in too much detail about specific lines. But the SG&A was a lot higher than I expected this quarter. Yes, volumes were higher, so was it higher commissions? And as I look at last year, and I know there's a million moving pieces here, but you started out $1.5 billion in SG&A. And it was roughly approximately that in each quarter. So is this start to the year giving us some sense of how to think about SG&A in the second, third, fourth quarters as well? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah, that was great question. I mean first and foremost, as you mentioned, the most variable item in SG&A really relates to sales commissions, and relates to these tiered programs that we have for our reps. And as they really perform and perform at quota, we pay them well. I think the second thing, some of the things that happened in first quarter, we invested in order to support these high-growth levels, and this means hiring sales reps. This means full on national sales meetings, and you're seeing the sort of quarter-over-quarter impact of those things. I think in the background, we definitely still have this inflationary environment that obviously impacts some of those things that flow through SG&A. We had merit increases that also hit in Q1. I think that SG&A should moderate -- moderate somewhat over the remainder of the year and Q1 is a little higher because of those factors I mentioned. But I also would say that we are sort of trending toward a more kind of normalized, pre-pandemic level of SG&A spend as it relates to a percent of sales. Rick Wise : Great. And one other question to touch on sort of a side topic a little bit. But smoke evacuation, I know you've talked about a lot in the past, Kevin, and we've seen three states. I think if I'm remembering correctly, Oregon, New York, New Jersey, smoke bills going into effect this year, 10 additional states in the pipeline. I know it's not all driven by state legislation, but nurse associations, et cetera, continue to want to move in this direction. Any update there? Are you still excited about this? Is this still going to be an above-average growth area for Stryker? Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Rick. Definitely excited about smoke evacuation. We now are at 11 states that mandate smoke evacuation with another roughly 10 that have sort of legislation that's pending, that will likely pass. It will be a tailwind for growth, for sure. We have that business captured in both a little bit of endoscopy and also in instruments just based on our portfolio of products. Both grew well north of 20% in the first quarter and that will continue as more and more states adopt. So definitely bullish on smoke evacuation. We're still in the early stages. And absolutely with nursing shortages and nursing demands for safety, it plays very, very well. Rick Wise : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Matthew Mishan : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Not to harp on like the one outlier, but I guess on neurovascular. Could you comment on like on some of the weakness there? And how you expect that to progress through kind of 2023? Jason Beach : Yeah, Matt, it's Jason. I'll take this one. And I'd say a couple of different things as you think about neurovascular. First off, in the US, you obviously saw in the first quarter, we returned back to growth. As we look at the rest of the year, we're pleased with the progress in the first quarter, and we think that will continue throughout the year in the US. As you think about international, right? As you all know, it's a dynamic environment in China with VBP. So that will be volatile. We did experience some VBP activity in the first quarter. You also know that China overall is a bit of material, so I won't get into the specifics of the impact in China, but it is included in our guidance. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. For NV, China was a pretty significant business. For overall Stryker not so much, but it was for NV. And so that negative you're seeing is really entirely driven by China in the international Neurovascular business. Matthew Mishan : Okay. Excellent. And then just on the other line where Mako is and I realize it's not all Mako in there. Just at what point do you expect to lap how customers are purchasing Mako and potentially start showing some growth in that line? Jason Beach : Yes. I'll take this one. As you can imagine, when you think about deal mix and some of the things that go into that line, it will continue to move around as we go throughout this year. And as you start to get into next year, certainly, you would expect to see that line turn to positive. But it is going to be driven by deal mix as we go throughout this year. Matthew Mishan : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank. Imron Zafar : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the 1788 Camera in Endoscopy. Can you just quantify first how TAM expensive that could be? And then how much potential there is for share gain with that camera? Once it sounds like it could be a little bit more needle moving than we've seen in prior launches for HD cameras? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. I wouldn't think so much about expansion of TAM, I would think much more about share gain. Because we're still basically in procedures that are using visualization. We're not creating new visualization for new procedures. But the reason I think it plays well for share gain is we have much better solutions for both sports medicine as well as neuro procedures. We were always fabulous with abdominal surgery, general surgery, but not quite as strong in those two specialties. And then being able to light up new fluoro force, new imaging agents to be able to detect cancer, that's game changing, right? We will be first to the market in being able to identify new forms of cancer. We will share that when those launches occur. We'll actually share that with you. But that will be a tremendous catalyst to drive share gain when you can identify critical parts of the anatomy much more precisely than the human eye can. And so we're very bullish on the long-term future for 1788. Imron Zafar : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Richard Newitter : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Kevin, just on Mako and ASCs, and forgive me if this is a naive question, just not the way things work. But just given that you're involved so early with so many instances where ASCs are getting resurrected or built out. I'm curious, does that give you an opportunity to feed or get a robotics conversation or consideration, capital placement conversation going very early? And I'm just wondering if that is kind of happening right now? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Being on the ground floor for ASCs is helpful for all of our capital equipment. And the fact that we can provide a lot of what they need really helps -- it puts us in a good position, because we're on the ground floor. And Mako speaks for itself. It's brand. It's very strong in the market. [The turns] [4:24] 13 are very well aware of Mako and they're asking for it. But I think it gives us an advantage, frankly, not just for Mako, but for all of our capital equipment businesses. Being so involved we're in the conversation, making it easy for the ASC to be able to not only design the ASCs, but actually be able to speed up the construction of the ASC if they partner with one company that can provide a lot of what they need. Richard Newitter : Yes. And kind of a similar tag-on question to that. You've been asked in the past about cross-selling or across service lines. You've said that just hospitals haven't moved as quickly along the path of being able to negotiate one product area for another and thinking along those lines. Is the ASC kind of further along on that negotiation process? And I'm just curious if you guys have an advantage there where if you start to tack on additional adjacencies, you might be able to actually facilitate cross-selling with your strong foothold with the procedures that you're already in now and you\u2019re -- the capital equipment businesses? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Certainly, for the ASCs, within orthopedic ASCs, they are buying really across product lines. They're still within the service line, but yes, they are buying capital. They're buying disposables, they're buying implants. And versus hospitals, that tend to stick at the product category level. This has been a shift with ASC for sure. But they're not buying across into a new service line like orthopedics or general surgery, because these ASCs are either orthopedic ASCs or they are GI ASCs or general surgery ASCs. So they are quite specific. But within Orthopedics and the Orthopedic ASC, they are absolutely buying across product categories and that definitely plays to our advantage because we're very deep within these service line, service line of orthopedics and obviously, neuro. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong start to the year. Just one quick question for me and sorry to harp on this, it has come up a few times on the call. But -- just as we look at the margins, not a lot of margin upside in the quarter. I appreciate you still have inflationary pressures and inventory rolling off the balance sheet that's impacting that. But wondering if you could talk a little bit more about anything specific that happened in the quarter given such a strong sales beat and you're talking positive pricing commentary. So just sort of reconciling in line margins given the extent of the sales beat. Thanks so much. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Danielle, good question. I hate to kind of be a broken record and reiterate some of the things that we did talk about. But I would tell you that -- you're absolutely right. We are feeling the higher product cost that came through towards the end of last year is now flowing through this quarter. And not a lot of upside is going to come from that. As I look at sort of upsides that we did see, this price is an upside that certainly helped us with margin. I would also say and I don't want to make light of it, but these improved manufacturing efficiencies and improved freight rates, although smaller, still incrementally helped us as well. And as the year goes on, as we feel the impact of those will become more significant. And so I think you'll see moderate improvements as the year goes on. Keep in mind, though, that mix is going to cause some fluctuation. And then we do have this underlying kind of inflationary environment that is a little bit of a headwind. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Two quick Mako questions here. Just, Glenn, first, what are the margin implications on kind of this leasing, this pickup in leasing on Mako? Is there anything good or bad that, that does the margin line? And when these contracts convert over to a sale, let's say, in six or 12 months, any margin implications then? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Honestly, rentals have been part of our plan. And so as we look at sort of how we're attacking the market, we're focused on placements. And to Jason's point, if customers prefer rentals or if they are less inclined to put the upfront money forward just because maybe competitors are placing products for free or things like that, we're more than willing to spread out this purchase price over any period of time that they're interested in. I mean oftentimes these rentals convert within a one year or two year to a purchase, and then we'll gain back the purchase price. I would tell you that in the context of our entire sales portfolio, it's just not a material number in terms of how it could move. So we are very happy to do rentals. Honestly, we want to just increase the Mako footprint. Jeffrey Johnson : All right. Fair enough. And then discussion here on competition and if competitors are going to offer no cost rentals or whatever no upfront, but then you guys as well, when you're happy with that as well. I guess the other thing I keep hearing out in the field, and we just want to cross check this with you. I mean the hospitals are kind of allocating more capital towards procedural tools, things that take care of the patients that are coming back in the hospital, less towards nonrevenue generating CapEx. I would assume that's another kind of thing that's impacting Mako at this point, too, right? I mean the hospital can put more towards your power tools in your Endo camera and get the rental upfront, it's a good allocation for them to go that direction and get kind of the best of both worlds. So I assume it's not just competition. There's a little bit here of just hospitals reallocating the procedural tools right now in the current cycle we're in. Jason Beach : Yes, Jeff, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. I mean what I would say is, to your point, there's different buckets of money that a hospital has to defense here, right? And so if they have operational expense, if you will, that they can use to place a Mako or something like that, and they may be a little tighter on the CapEx side, it certainly is a lever that they have. And to Glenn's point, we're super happy to help them with that. So it is an option for them. And again, one that we're certainly happy to partner with them on. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I realize we're getting a little late here. But I wanted to get back to the Ortho strength, but maybe come at it from an international angle. The growth in the quarter was quite strong, admittedly off a lower base. But are there similar factors relative to the US driving the growth, meaning a better staffing environment, backlog capture? Or is there another kind of more dominant factor driving the international Ortho growth? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I'd say it's really the same factors. So the nursing situation has gotten better. Just dealing with COVID, that did affect us in the first two months of last year, in Australia, in Europe, in many of these markets. And I would say that Mako is now really starting to pick up steam in many of these markets. It took a little longer than it has in the United States, but that's a contributor. Cementless is also growing pretty rapidly in certain markets around the world, some slower than others. But I would say it's the same factors at play. Not ASCs so much. I know in the UK, they're looking at potentially starting to have some ASCs. That's a very small factor outside the United States. But the other two factors of really getting procedures back up and running, doing a better job dealing with nursing, there are still issues here and there. But getting those back patients or as a patient backlog like there is here in the United States, so people who have been putting off their procedures now wanting to get their procedures done. So I would say it's a very similar dynamic in other parts of the world. But again, our head starting robotics, our head start in cementless does position us well, and we are extremely pleased with the performance internationally in the first quarter. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick one for Glenn. You kind of touched on this earlier, but pricing, it was what, 70 basis point good guy in 1Q, the annual guidance calls for a relatively neutral pricing for the year. Is it primarily a mix dynamic, acting as the biggest potential weight on price over the next few quarters? I'm just kind of wondering what would pressure price over the next three quarters? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I mean it's -- mix is one factor. I think some of the other things are -- these pricing programs are going to anniversary in Q3 when we kick them off. So year-over-year, it just won't show up as a big a difference. The other thing I would say is on this product super cycle, those products are launched. They're not included in the pricing calculation because they're next-gen models of the previous old models. And we really only compare like-for-like. So that's a little bit of a factor that, honestly, will help us on the top line because those products generally go out at much higher prices than the predicate product. And so I think if you take all that together, we just believe right now that we anticipate landing prices neutral for the full year, which honestly we'll still take as a win. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Kyle Rose : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask overall on the capital side. I mean, obviously, you've talked about the capital super cycle that you have. I'm just wondering if you could compare and contrast some of the maybe new build out demand versus replacement demand? I think if I remember correctly, Kevin, last year, there were staffing shortages on things like the construction side of things. So just if you could help us understand what the new build out demand looks like. And then overall split between small and large capital would be very helpful. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So sure, most of our demand comes from replacement, certainly on small capital by far. On large capital, there's -- it does tilt quite a bit more towards construction. There are still a lot of construction activities that are still underway. Some of them got delayed because they just couldn't get supplies, because they had staffing challenges. So there was a bit of push in some cases. But we have a really healthy order book, whether it's Mako, whether it's Beds, whether it's our booms and lights, pretty healthy order book. And those businesses have been performing very well. So -- and those tend to be kind of a six month, we have a forward look for about six months. And so right now, we're seeing pretty healthy demand across all of our small capital as well as large capital businesses. And we'll see how that plays out in the future. But at least we have pretty good visibility, at least for the next six months, that things are good, and we're going to expect continued strong performance in all of our capital business. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Lobo for any additional or closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : So thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter. We've raised our guidance and we look forward to showing our Q2 results with you in August. Thank you. Operator *: This concludes today's call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Todd and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the diverse and attractive markets that we play in and our ability to drive growth through strong commercial execution. We are also pleased with the continued positive outcomes of our globalization efforts. Our international business demonstrated strong performance with double-digit growth, complementing our strong and fast-growing U.S. business. In addition, we continue to see traction with our pricing initiatives, again delivering positive pricing in the second quarter. During the quarter, we continued to realize improvements in component availability, although disruptions remain in parts of our business. Our teams have demonstrated good agility in addressing these situations, proactively mitigating much of their impact. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.54 a share, reflecting 13% growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also marks the beginning of our margin recovery. We expect margins to continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, with half the year behind us and our solid momentum, we have increased our expected full year organic sales growth to a range of 9.5% to 10.5% and increased our expected earnings per share to $10.25 to $10.45 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako, acquisitions and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in most countries. And while volumes are strong, patient backlog still remains, and we believe the elevated orthopedic procedural demand will continue well into 2024. While volumes have largely recovered, hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe. These challenges are resolving gradually as we expected and will continue to be a moderate tailwind as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as evidenced from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Instruments and Neuro Cranial divisions. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international performances, which is helping drive our continued growth in hips and knees. Next, capital order backlog remains elevated, well above normal levels. Also, during the quarter, we executed a small tuck-in deal and also closed on the Cerus Endovascular acquisition. Furthermore, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In late Q2, we successfully completed a limited launch of our 1788 camera platform and are poised for full launch in Q3. We also received FDA clearance for Cranial Guidance, our newest application under our Q Guidance platform. This empowers surgeons to quickly plan a safe surgical approach using multiple imaging modalities and then navigate instruments with specific surgical procedures. Finally, we remain on track for the launch of our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year and in the U.S. in early 2024. These launches will continue to support growth over multiple years. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.9% in the quarter. The second quarter\u2019s average selling days were in line with 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.5%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12%, International organic sales growth was 11.4%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Adjusted EPS of $2.54 in the quarter was up 12.9% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.03. Now, I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology has both constant currency and organic sales growth of 12.9%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 10.9% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and surge account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 3.5% against a strong comparable. This included strong growth in its ProCare sustainability and sports medicine businesses. The Endoscopy business completed its limited launch of the 1788 camera late in the second quarter. Consistent with prior camera launches and the related transition period between the legacy camera and the new camera, this also contributed to muted growth in Q2. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 27.2%, reflecting very strong performances in all three of its businesses, acute care, emergency care and Sage, and benefited from continued improvement in product supply during the quarter. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.6%, which included double-digit growth in our Bone Mill, bipolar forceps and Max Space product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 10.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in our medical and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and Canada. Neurovascular\u2019s growth continues to be negatively impacted by VBP in China. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.6%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 12.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 10.6% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business grew 8.8% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia hip stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 14.3% organically with strong performances across all businesses led by very strong growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.2%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our U.S. Other Ortho declined organically 1.6%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 12.1% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets. Now, I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorable, approximately 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and 70 basis points sequentially compared to Q1 2023. This change was primarily driven by the slight easing of certain cost pressures, decreases in spot buy purchases, improved productivity and the benefit of price, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.4% of sales, which represents an 80 basis points decrease from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was 70 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022, due to a disciplined ramp of spend and investment to support our growth. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.3% of sales which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $66 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense. The second quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we reiterate our full year effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.9 billion. Approximately $100 million of the term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, reflecting year-to-date payments of $200 million and a remaining balance of $650 million. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. Considering our year-to-date results, our strong backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% with pricing to be slightly positive for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Congrats on a great quarter here. Two for me. First, a great quarter. It looks like you\u2019re raising more than the beat on both the top and bottom line. Looks like you\u2019re taking a good amount of share still in Ortho across hips, knees and extremities, trauma. Just as we think about the balance of the year, you touched on some of them, but would love to get a sense of what gives you the confidence these elevated trends are going to continue. And any visibility on the margin side that gets you comfortable moving it up more than the beat? Kevin Lobo : Hi Robbie, it\u2019s Kevin. I\u2019ll start off with sort of the confidence in the procedures. We\u2019ve talked about this since the third quarter of last year, a good sense based on surgery backlogs, talking to physicians and seeing that there was pent-up demand through the pandemic. So, we expected elevated procedures coming into the year. That has certainly played out. You\u2019ve heard even similar comments from some of the providers in the space. And these surgery backlogs are long -- they longer, probably a two-month surgery backlog is more like four months. And so that gives us confidence that through the end of this year and into next year that we\u2019re going to continue to see elevated procedural growth. And we also see that in the demand for our small capital, which again, there\u2019s equipment that\u2019s used for ongoing procedures. And then, I\u2019ll turn to Glenn for margins. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hey Robbie. As we got through the quarter, as I mentioned, we really started to see some positive and easing of some of the cost pressures that we had felt in Q1 and certainly last year. I think we also are starting to feel some of the improvements in supply chain. That\u2019s not to say that everything is rosy. We are still feeling inflationary pressures in transportation, some of our commodities, labor, certain electronics. But I will say that spot buys in Q1, spot buys in Q2 have not been material. And we\u2019re getting near the amortization of the impact of spot buys from last year. So I feel like that gives me good confidence that I think we\u2019ll see continued improvement in our gross margin as we move into Q3 and Q4. And so, we really will feel that gradual improvement, and we\u2019ll feel it all the way down to the op margin line. Robbie Marcus : Great. And maybe just a follow-up for me for both of you or however you want to take it. People are really happy so far with the year, but unfortunately, we\u2019re always focused on the future and looking out to next year already. You talked about, Kevin, these trends continuing. You have the super cycle in MedSurg. Just any kind of thoughts on how we should think about these elevated trends continuing and thoughts? I know you\u2019re laser-focused on getting back to your 2016 -- or 2019 operating margin of 26.3%. How do we think about how far out that might be? Kevin Lobo : Well, I think Jason\u2019s comments in the openings say we do expect the procedural positive trends to continue well into next year. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball exactly, will that be 100 basis points or 200 basis points more elevated than it was back through the pandemic in last year. So -- but we expect that to be elevated. The super cycle of products is widely exciting, something like -- look at Neptune S is off to a great start within instruments, the 1788 [ph] is only going to start kind of the latter part of this quarter. So, that\u2019s going to b a big impact next year, got a new defibrillator coming that\u2019s more next. So, these are launches, ProCuity is multiple year. We have the stair chair of the Xpedition. Amazing product that medical launch brand new and it\u2019s new category altogether that launched Q1 of this year, that will continue into next year. So, a lot of continuation of really strong growth across our businesses. So, you should expect what -- going to continue to be a high-growth company going into next year. Yes. Let me just -- sorry, let me finish. I forgot it was a long question. So yes, we are absolutely committed to returning to pre-COVID margins and then growing our margins thereafter. This quarter marked a really important step, a very big first step in that evolution. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the question. And I\u2019ll echo Robbie\u2019s congratulations on a very impressive quarter here. So Kevin, I wanted to start on MedSurg, the new products. Just talk about how the new camera in endoscopy might have impacted Q2? And what you expect the impact to be from that in \u201823 and \u201824? And Medical growing 27% organically after Vocera anniversaried. What drove that? And how did Vocera do in the second quarter? And what\u2019s the outlook? And I had one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Okay. You got a few in there already, and you got a follow-up. But okay, that\u2019s fine. Listen, we\u2019re really excited about the performance of our MedSurg business, continues to be really a great segment of our company. What I\u2019d tell you on the endo side is the camera had really no impact. It was a limited launch, really just making sure that the product is performing as we thought. And the test cases have gone extremely well. And really, the full launch hasn\u2019t started. That will start in the back half of the Q3. So you\u2019ll start to see some impact in Q3, and that will accelerate in Q4 and that will even accelerate more next year. As you know, you\u2019ve seen these launches in the past. So it really picks up year one, sometimes even year two, be even higher than year one. So, we\u2019re going to see a lot of impact next year. There\u2019ll be some impact in Q3, but -- in Q4, but really, it will start to ramp. So it\u2019s really no impact in Q3 on endoscopy. And that\u2019s why endoscopy is a little bit softer, had a big comp from last year, too, but at the end of these camera launches, you do see it start to slow down and then it really picks up with the new product. Medical had an absolutely stellar quarter, another 25-plus percent growth, and we had that in the fourth quarter, if you recall, as well. And Medical has really over the past six years, become a large, consistent high-growth division. It does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, if you look at a rolling 4 quarters, rolling 8 quarters, this is a real high-growth business. Now I think it\u2019s probably one of the most misunderstood businesses, honestly, or I would say, underestimated business in our portfolio. You\u2019ve got the integration of Sage, Physio-Control, Vocera, which you referenced. But you\u2019ve got new launches, Power-PRO 2 as a new ambulance cot at the beginning of last year. ProCuity bed frame still gaining steam. Sage has PrimoFit. You have Xpedition\u2019s stair chair that I mentioned. And then there\u2019s also a lot more awareness on safety. So our AED portfolio, there\u2019s a lot more awareness. So I would say new demand for AEDs based on all the safety, the LUCAS automatic chest compression product and really a fantastic management team in Medical. So, will I expect 25% again next quarter? Probably not. But I do expect that Medical will continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. And then specifically related to Vocera, it -- both sales and orders ramped in the quarter as we expected. So you remember, we sort of talked to you about Q3 -- Q3, Q4 and Q1 of this year kind of being flat after we sort of went through the integration and we said it\u2019s going to pick up meaningfully, both picked up meaningfully in Q2, both sales as well as orders. And so they are also a contributor, but really strength across the entire portfolio. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. And just I\u2019ll keep my follow-up really brief. Glenn, the comps are very different in Q3 and Q4. Should we be thinking about stronger growth in Q3 relative to Q4? Just the cadence for the rest of the year? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I mean, a couple of things. Q3 seasonally is usually not a super strong quarter, but I think if you focus on Q4 and you look at the comp that we\u2019re up against, that probably plays into how much we\u2019re going to grow against that comp. The big number last year, it was $5.2 billion in the quarter, which is a big number. So, I think what you\u2019ll see is you\u2019ll see slightly higher growth in Q3, and then that that will come down a little bit because of the comp, but I think we\u2019ll end the year nicely, well within our guidance. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Very nice quarter. A follow-up on the Medical. Can you talk about the CapEx environment? How much has changed in the last sort of 90 days or so and possible increase in CapEx as the revenues and costs are looking pretty good for hospitals? And on the backlog, did you guys reduce the backlog in the quarter? And was that a bolus for 2Q and should that be normalizing in the back half of the year? And then also on Microchips, is that should we view that getting better as a gross margin improvement from lower costs or increasing revenues as you reduce that backlog? Jason Beach : It\u2019s Jason. I\u2019ll start here and then maybe some follow on. But as we think about the capital environment, we continue to see great strength from a capital environment standpoint. And even as you think about the backlog in our business, I think your question was, was there a bolus. But if you look at our backlog, it continues to be at very high levels, higher than what we came into the year with. So, still strength there on the capital side. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then one more on gross margin. It sounds like a lot of tailwinds in 2Q were pretty much permanent in nature, and you said that the gross margin should improve in the back half of the year. Can you refresh us on how many months of inventory you guys have on the balance sheet? And when those -- these deflation pressures we\u2019re seeing, start transferring to the P&L. Just wondering if that\u2019s sort of the key driver of the gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter simply by duration by waiting for that to transfer. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think the big thing that really sits in inventory and worked its way through sort of in the first quarter and the second quarter was the impact of those spot buys. And generally, inventory turns depending on the product, anywhere from 6 to 9 months. So yes, we will generally see the impact of spot buys reduced for the rest of this year. Keep in mind that we still have this sort of inflationary headwind that we will be working against in Q3 and Q4. But just the mere fact that I feel like we\u2019re getting to the end of the impact of spot buys, gives me confidence that we should see gradual gross margin improvement in the rest of this year. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Kevin, the guidance is pretty impressive, 10% organic. Are comps something that we should worry about from a fiscal \u201824 perspective? I know you mentioned certain product tailwinds. Just help us contextualize that 10%. And given that some of these procedure trends, it looks like it could sustain into \u201824. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Vijay. Remember, we grew 9.7% organically last year. So, we had a pretty good year last year as well and we\u2019re growing on top of that. Again, this innovation cycle we have is tremendous. The procedure demands are strong. We\u2019re -- as you see, we\u2019re growing very fast even though the markets elevated, we\u2019re growing above market in virtually every one of our businesses. So that gives us confidence that we\u2019re going to continue to be able to grow at the high end of Medtech. And for this year, we\u2019ve -- already half the year is already in the bag. And yes, the Q4 last year was abnormally fast, growing over 13%. So we -- in our guidance, we do reflect a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate just related to those comps. But we do expect, based on backlog of surgery demand, aging population, more people playing pick a ball, you name it, right, activity, causing injuries. So this will continue to be a tailwind. And we think through much of next year -- that\u2019s our current visibility. I mean obviously, that could change, but that\u2019s how we see it. And we kind of called this, if you recall, Q3 of last year, we sort of called that this is what we were going to see. It\u2019s actually materializing, frankly, a little better than we expected in terms of the flow-through in procedures and hospital staffing. They\u2019re dealing with it much better than we expected. There are still flare-ups here and there, but it\u2019s certainly gotten better, hospitals are better equipped and patients are anxious to get their procedures done. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. It looks like we\u2019re on track, actually well north of 50 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal \u201823. Is this something that\u2019s sustainable when you look at the operating model, assuming there\u2019s nothing crazy on the inflation side for next year. I\u2019m curious how we should be thinking about leverage. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. We -- you\u2019re going to force me to divulge all the things we want to tell you in our investor meeting. But I would say, our old mantra of expanding 30 to 50 basis points every year was absolutely doable, and it\u2019s absolutely something that we are planning on getting back to. We\u2019re working through some of these higher costs through the P&L. There\u2019s this ongoing inflation that we will solve for. But I don\u2019t think that as we look forward over the longer term, the margin expansion is something that I think you\u2019ll continue to see out of us. I don\u2019t want to pinpoint a number just yet. But yes, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to have. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The one thing I would add, so Glenn wasn\u2019t necessarily referring to \u201824, when you said 30 to 50. We\u2019re on a ramp and on a major focus to get back to that 26.3%. And then thereafter kind of get into a normal rhythm. So, we\u2019ll give you more clarity around that at the Analyst Day in November. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O\u2019Brien: I really don\u2019t want to make too much out of one quarter here. But when I look at the two-year stacked growth rate for you guys versus your biggest competitor in hips in knees, you had been outperforming them massively in the last several quarters. This quarter, it really tightened up the delta between you two, specifically in knees. So I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re seeing competitively, maybe in cementless or on the robotics side, that you should call out or that we should think about as you go forward, just in terms of being able to significantly outperform the market in hips and knees over the next year or so? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, I\u2019m actually pretty happy with double-digit growth in our Knee business. And look at OUS, we\u2019re really starting to ramp the OUS. Mako is just getting going. It\u2019s really getting started. So that massive outperformance you saw before was on the backs of Mako and cementless. And we\u2019re probably going to see some of that outside the United States. And the U.S. performance is very strong. In one quarter, I\u2019m not going to get overly excited. We\u2019re still the fastest growing Hip and Knee company. And you remember from the past, you used to be -- grew well in one, you didn\u2019t grow well in the other, and we covered both, hips and knees. It wasn\u2019t hips or knees, hips and knees in Q2. So, no, we\u2019re not seeing anything as really different. We focus on our own execution with our market-leading robotics and our strong portfolio continue the rollout in Insignia, which has been an absolute home run. We\u2019re going to continue to perform very well. Matthew O\u2019Brien: I appreciate that, Kevin. And then on the pricing side, I know it\u2019s now flipped from kind of a headwind this year to a tailwind. But I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re working through some of those benefits. So, is pricing going to be another tailwind or positive for Stryker into \u201824 and even \u201825 as well as you\u2019ve got these long-term contracts? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think I\u2019ll make some couple of comments around that without maybe providing exact guidance on 2024. But, if we look at the initiatives that we executed this year, we had a very targeted program that looked kind of product by product. And in general, what we\u2019re seeing is MSNT is generally gaining positive price. And I would say Ortho is less negative and has much larger, longer-term contract negotiations. Keep in mind too that our price comparison that we report on includes sort of same product sales compared to prior year. So, if you think about increases that we gain on prices, say, on next-gen products that we\u2019re going to launch, that\u2019s not necessarily included in the number we say for price. But I would tell you that we generally see meaningful price increases on these next-gen products, especially when we bring newer technology to the market or a feature set that currently isn\u2019t provided. So, I do think that we\u2019ll continue to see price as a tailwind. It\u2019s a muscle that we\u2019ve certainly grown this year, and I think it\u2019s going to be part of our game plan for sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Congrats on a really nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask, Kevin, a little bit about the Cerus deal and Neurovascular. It was slower before, but 9% organic growth in the U.S. is really nice to see, especially in hemorrhagic. When we look at what Cerus has done in the UK, it\u2019s been pretty impressive. And so, I\u2019m curious kind of what your expectations are for the contribution in the U.S. and when we start to really see that in numbers, especially if you\u2019re doing 9% U.S. organic growth in Neurovascular. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So the first thing I\u2019d say is that Cerus has not yet approved in the United States. So, that 9% growth had no benefit from Cerus, right? So I think you know that. I just want to make that clear to everybody that the trials are ongoing right now. We look forward to that approval in the United States. We\u2019ve launched two new products. We had a Tetra small coil as well as 46 catheter -- 46 size catheter, Vecta catheter. So two new products that helps in terms of driving the hemorrhagic growth. And the U.S. has been a little bit of a challenge for us more if you look back at the last few quarters, and really pleased to see that step up in this quarter, and we\u2019re very excited that -- and we closed the deal. Obviously, it was during the quarter. It hasn\u2019t had been a big impact at all. But a lot of excitement at the product we know performs extremely well based on what\u2019s happening in OUS, and we can\u2019t wait for the approval. It\u2019s definitely going to be a shot in the arm when it does happen in the United States. Ryan Zimmerman : Yes. No question. We saw that at SNIS this week. I wanted to ask a follow-up on robotics. We didn\u2019t hear you say much on your Shoulder and Spine programs. And just given that there is some other commentary out there from competitors about kind of Shoulders and Spine. What\u2019s your latest thinking about potential timing, launch cycles and so forth on Mako shoulder and/or spine. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Great. Nothing new to report. We\u2019re kind of on schedule with what we had said before. Spine in the back half of next year and shoulder towards the end of next year. And frankly, we\u2019re not really concerned about competitive activity in this space. We already know Globus and Medtronic have robots in spine. We are really excited about our overall enabling technology starting with Q Guidance. We have an additional product that we\u2019ll be launching and Mako Spine. So, by the end of next year we\u2019ll have a really compelling suite of enabling technology tools for Spine, which we\u2019re really excited about. If someone else is first in shoulder it doesn\u2019t concern me in the least. We have Blueprint already. We already have a very powerful enabling tech platform for shoulder, whether it\u2019s patient matched ID, whether it\u2019s using HoloLens to do the procedure with virtual reality, whether it\u2019s the Blueprint technology, which is amazing. And we\u2019re going to use that amazing Blueprint technology to feed Mako, and that will just be icing on the cake on an upper extremity business that is cooking on gas right now with amazing growth quarter after quarter after quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC. Shagun Singh : I was just wondering if you could refresh us on your capital allocation priorities and M&A just in terms of deal size valuation in areas of interest? And then on the product side, if you could just touch on trauma and what\u2019s driving the strong growth there and the durability? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So as we\u2019ve said in the past, we -- our first focus on capital allocation right now is paying down debt, given the debt that we built up on Wright Medical as well as Vocera. That does not stop us from doing little deals. We did one small deal within instruments, and then we close on Cerus. So we\u2019re still looking at tuck-ins primarily this year. But the deal teams are all very active. They\u2019re having discussions. They\u2019re out building their lists and they\u2019re all really having nice pipelines. And so as our cash position gets strong, again, we\u2019ll be back on offense. That will be the first use of our cash. I mean, we\u2019ve had a really terrific track record of M&A, and we can\u2019t wait to be able to get back on offense with M&A. But first priority is certainly paying down debt at the moment, and we\u2019re doing that. So, what\u2019s the second part? Jason Beach : Trauma. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So trauma, I\u2019ll tell you this Wright Medical acquisition has been spectacular. The upper extremities business growing very strong double-digit growth every quarter. Foot and Ankle really starting to pick up. So we\u2019re really excited about the performance this quarter was terrific in Foot and Ankle with strong double-digit growth. And then core trauma has actually been a big beneficiary of Wright Medical. So in the past, our core trauma business was really diluted in its focus. It was focusing on Foot and Ankle, focusing more on extremities because they\u2019re faster growing. And we were sort of not paying as much attention to core trauma. We have a great leadership team on core trauma with now dedicated focused R&D resources. And obviously, they launched Gamma4. We had the T2 Alpha product launch. We\u2019re going to have PeriPRO products launch soon, excited about some other innovations we plan to show at OTA later in the fall. So, really refreshing the portfolio, great focus on core trauma and they had a really excellent quarter as well. So, all three business units performed very well in the quarter. And again, the Wright Medical deal, it\u2019s not just benefiting our extremities business, it\u2019s actually providing more focus core trauma, which is fueling terrific growth in core trauma. So trauma, we expect to continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Eric Anderson : This is Eric on for Josh. I was curious to hear your thoughts around smart implants. One of your competitors is moving closer to a full launch of a smart implant technology, and I was just curious to hear your updated thoughts there. And if there are any updates to share from your work around OrthoSensor, that would be great to hear as well. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, I think smart implants is interesting. We obviously have MotionSense which is a wearable on the outside to measure basically similar dynamics that are going to be measured from the smart implant. So I think range of motion, all these factors, it\u2019s interesting. We\u2019re not quite sure yet what to do with that data. How compelling that will be, will that affect patient selection? Will it affect approaches to procedure? So I would call it something that is more investigational and more of a learning that we\u2019re going to have. And -- but I do think it\u2019s something that could be important in the future. So not discounting it. I don\u2019t have anything more to share on OrthoSensor other than we are -- we have launched MotionSense, which is the wearable which attaches to both the femur as well as tibia to track mobility and a range of other metrics. And we\u2019re going to learn a lot, we will and so others in the industry about what is it that really matters that you\u2019re measuring in the post-surgery period, and really how does that affect the patient care, patient -- maybe patient selection, maybe what implants they should be using, is there a feedback loop that\u2019s meaningful. We don\u2019t know -- we don\u2019t have answers. We have a lot of questions, and it\u2019s going to give us new data that we can then learn from. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d characterize at the moment. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matt Miksic : I wanted to ask a question on Mako, one of the comments that you made, and I apologize if this came up already, hoping back and forth really, because a lot of folks tonight and different calls. But you mentioned an increase in deal mix, I guess, an increase in rental deal mix affecting the dollar revenues that came in from Mako in other -- this quarter. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve heard from other folks as well as you\u2019re I\u2019m sure aware in terms of robots, more sort of hospitals taking a flexible option to leasing or as-you-go arrangements for robots. First, I\u2019m wondering how tightly correlated that with sort of growth in the ASC? And the second, in the past, Kevin, I think you talked about like early on, well, some hospitals are capital rich, some hospitals are operating in commercial and have endowments or whatever, there\u2019s different hospitals have a different preference on how they want to pay for -- that was sort of like how we used to think about this. I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019re seeing sort of hybridization of that? In other words, we want to know Mako, you could pay for it, but let\u2019s scale into it, with a lease arrangement or something. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing that kind of shift in the market. And I have one follow-up, if I could. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. Thanks. So what I would tell you is the ASC\u2019s growth is obviously increasing in the ASCs with Mako and virtually all of the ASC deals are financed because physician ownership is part of the ASC scenario. They don\u2019t have the capital budgets the hospitals do. So yes, as ASC penetration increases, more financing, rental type deals are automatically going to happen because they\u2019re virtually all financed, the ASC. Your question around the hospital dynamic, I think it\u2019s just if you have competitive systems that are not sort of being charged for, then the hospital says, well, maybe I don\u2019t need to spend the capital, even if I have the capital and maybe I -- let me talk to you about what you do. And so, we offer them the full suite. And yes, some are opting to go for the financing route that maybe in the past would have purchased, but we have a healthy order book, and we\u2019re not really agnostic to whether they want to buy cash or where they want to finance it. It really doesn\u2019t matter to us because we get the value from that. Whether we get the value on cash on day one and get the cash over time doesn\u2019t really concern us, and it certainly has been fuel for our strong implant growth. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s great. And just quickly on -- you mentioned endoscopy later in the camera and not really having an effect yet, but quite differentiated and quite different this cycle with the sort of opportunity to test surgical margins around tumors and things that really represent kind of a new phase of sort of camera and imaging functionality. Any sense -- I know it\u2019s early but -- of what that does to the shape of this product cycle versus what we\u2019ve experienced in the past? I mean fluorescence imaging was pretty big for you in the last launch, this sort of takes that up a notch, just any color you can provide in terms of what your expectations are and the early interest, et cetera, on the camera side. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. Look, it\u2019s a little early still for me to get too ahead of myself, but the fluorescence imaging was a big deal, right, first in 1588 and then 1688 when you had the overlay from fluorescence where you didn\u2019t have to toggle between black and white and fluorescence. That was pretty meaningful. So those are pretty big steps. But you\u2019re right, this -- with the tumor margin ability -- the ability to use new dies beyond ICG, wildly exciting to get into lung, to get into bladder. This is really, really exciting with pharmacological agents. It\u2019s also a camera that is extremely good in neuro and sports where historically, we weren\u2019t as strong. We had -- it was fabulous for general surgery, but not quite as good. This camera addresses those issues. So, I\u2019m really excited about it. But it\u2019s a little early that the test cases have gone very well. I wouldn\u2019t expect this to be any less performing than our prior launches, potentially could be even more. The feedback so far is pretty exciting. Yes, we have some really good features in this front. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : I apologize, there\u2019s a lot going on tonight. But your operating margins were really impressive. And I\u2019m curious how we should think about those for the back half of the year? And if you can give a full year guide on it, or even how we should think about this into next year, if you\u2019re willing to waive that far? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Joanne, we -- yes. We really -- if you think about operating margins, especially our performance in Q2, we saw a really sort of good improvement, honestly, in gross margin just in terms of some easing of some of the cost pressures, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, spot buys are not material. They weren\u2019t material in Q1, and they\u2019re not material in Q2. I think the other thing, too, that we\u2019re feeling is just that now that we have more evening of supply, we\u2019re also back to sort of better productivity gains. And so all of those things give us good confidence that we should see gross margins improve in the back half of this year, and they\u2019ll gradually improve because we\u2019re still feeling some of this inflation, but that kind of gives us the confidence. And obviously, some of that will roll into next year as you think about our performance for next year. But we -- at this point, we\u2019re not going to guide on that other than to say that we do think we\u2019ll see some gradual improvement for the rest of this year. Joanne Wuensch : Maybe this is an analyst question at the meeting or the next time you gather all together for an update. But how do you think about in a more normalized post-pandemic environment sort of operating margin expansion on a regular go-forward, maybe even year-over-year basis? Kevin Lobo : Yes, Joanne, earlier in the call, I think this question was asked, I\u2019ll just repeat that we are laser-focused on, I would say, trying to sprint back to the 26.3% that we had in 2019. And so we\u2019re going to try to move margins on a more ambitious way to get back to that. And then once we get back to that kind of level, I think you\u2019re going to see us wanting to expand margins in a kind of a more consistent way. I don\u2019t know the exact number, something like 50 bps. We\u2019ll get more specific as time passes. But more like an annual, more moderate, nice progression year after year after year, especially with this kind of high growth that we\u2019re experiencing organically. You\u2019re going to expect to see more normalized margin expansion. But in the meantime, we\u2019re looking to move at a faster clip given the falloff that we\u2019ve had since \u201819 and try to restore those margins. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel. Rick Wise : Kevin, I was hoping you would just give us a little more color and perspective on really your very solid international performance double digits, obviously, almost the as strong as U.S. performance, but a little slower than the first quarter\u2019s pace. You highlighted the strong emerging markets. How -- I\u2019m just going to ask one question with a couple of parts. How sustainable is this? You talked about some of your key initiatives? And just maybe just your perspectives on the sustainability, what\u2019s the drivers here? And maybe where we are in terms of procedure volume recovery back to normal in Europe just in a larger picture sense? Thanks so much. And great to see the excellent quarter. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thank you. Look, international has -- it took us a while, but the last five years, international growth has exceeded the U.S. growth. Now obviously, the U.S. growth this quarter was pretty spectacular. But we\u2019re absolutely a believer and continue to have very good international growth in the years ahead, frankly, making up for lost time because our market shares are still below what we have in the U.S. in most of the international markets. And so we have significant upside in front of us. Procedure volumes are pretty much back to normal everywhere. They\u2019re back normally in Europe. They\u2019re back to normal in Australia. They\u2019re back to normal pretty much in Japan. So, the market that hurt us, frankly, in the quarter was China. So that China continues to be a drag because of VBP both in neurovascular having an impact, also impacting our Spine business. So China continues to be a bit of a drag. But in spite of that, we had really terrific growth in international. And I\u2019d say that Mako is really starting to pick up steam in Asia Pacific. So we already have a pretty good presence in Europe. But in Asia Pacific, it\u2019s Japan, India, China, it\u2019s really starting to pick up. And I think that\u2019s a great leading indicator that will produce really terrific growth both in hips and knees for many quarters to come as that momentum continues. And then as well, the camera launches of 78, that\u2019s also really exciting for the international market. So, we\u2019re going to continue the progress. Even Europe had another strong quarter. That\u2019s just kind of expected now. It\u2019s steady and strong growth every quarter, and we\u2019re still not where we\u2019d like to be in Europe. So, this is just one of those things that takes time. But if you think about something like cameras, where when we started the Transatlantic model, we were number 5 or 6, and we expect to take over number 1 sometime this year. Our power tools share was in the low 30s, and it\u2019s crossed 50%, but it\u2019s still not where it is in the United States. It\u2019s not where it is in Australia. So, international should be something that continues in a very steady way. Just as it has the last five years, it\u2019s been kind of very consistent. And in emerging markets, that\u2019s the area we have the most opportunity, where we\u2019re still very, very small, growing nicely, but off a small base. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll ask both of mine up upfront. Some of the payers and providers have talked about a slower July. I was just curious if you could kind of frame some of the summer seasonality, if you\u2019re seeing more normal seasonality or how it kind of compares given some of those payer comments? And then a margin question for you, Glenn. Just curious if we should use the second half operating margin this year as kind of a new jumping off point since this is the more normal cost environment in the second half? Kevin Lobo : Listen, sorry, your sound quality was a little hard hearing you. I think you\u2019re asking about July if we saw something strange seasonality in July. And look -- we don\u2019t normally comment on one month. And I would tell you -- you saw our raised guidance like we\u2019re expecting a pretty good second half of the year. And I don\u2019t really want to get into one month. And the -- sometimes you do have certain dynamics that happen. But there\u2019s nothing really important that I want to call out for the month of July. And then I think the second part was margin. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Travis, can you repeat that in terms of the operating margin question? Travis Steed : Yes, sorry. I\u2019m just curious if the second half of this year is kind of the new jumping off point for margins going forward, just given that this is a more normalized cost environment in the second half? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, I would say a couple of things. First of all, Q4 is always seasonally higher. It\u2019s our highest op margin performing quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that that should be the jumping off. I think if you back up from where our guidance is, you could sort of figure out kind of where we\u2019re angling to end the year at, and that would be the good jumping off point. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : This is Simon Hagan [ph] on for Danielle. Congrats on the strong quarter. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes to the underlying ortho market growth when you look at factors such as pricing, innovation and potential trend towards treating both much younger and older -- much older patients? And I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, the trends aren\u2019t different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. It\u2019s surgery demand backlogs of surgeons that people -- frankly, the older patients who\u2019ve been -- now really want to get procedures done, there are more active people out there, as I kind of referenced earlier, who want to get their procedures done. So innovation wins the day, right? So the robotics continues to be a real terrific for us, and we continue to see increased utilization. Percent of Mako procedures done continues to rise. Percent of cementless continues to rise. Percent of hips being done on Mako continues to rise. So that\u2019s not new. Those are a continuation of prior trends. And so there isn\u2019t some kind of new dynamic. It\u2019s just the pent-up demand of patients that we kept waiting for, they\u2019re coming and they\u2019re going to continue to come for some period of time. And the aging population, people every day, some 10,000 turn 65. And so there is demographics that are on our side. There is the hangover from COVID that\u2019s on our side. And for Stryker, we have a portfolio that we\u2019re really excited about. In addressing the Direct Anterior with our Insignia stem was critically important, and we\u2019ve done that, and we\u2019re seeing fantastic uptake of that hip stem, which is driving terrific growth in hips. So that\u2019s kind of new for us as to -- if you look in the last year, our growth has really picked up, and that was really because of the product that we launched really addressing an important and growing segment of the procedures in hips. Unidentified Analyst : And just one follow-up, really off of what you were just talking about. Looking at the competitive position in large joints in the United States, how do you expect to continue driving share gains, and where do you see yourself given continued innovation? Kevin Lobo : Look, we really like our chances. A huge demand for Mako hasn\u2019t stopped. We know we have the best system on the market, which we\u2019re really excited about. We\u2019ve filled our gap with Insignia on the hip side. We have an awesome 3D-printed hip cup with Trident II. We have the cementless offering, which, of course, we\u2019re way ahead, a huge head start on cementless. Terrific publications coming out with excellent five-year data on cementless, which will give surgeons even more confidence in that in the future. And so there\u2019s other things the team are looking at. We have some really exciting products -- our hinge product that we\u2019re going to come out with later this year to shore up revision. And that\u2019s pretty exciting. We have plans to have revision on Mako as well in the not-too-distant future. So we\u2019re not going to sort of sit tight on just everything we\u2019ve already done. There are incremental additions. We just not so long ago launched that 2.0 software for -- to improve the user experience, improve the training of residents. And so, we think we have a winning hand, and we\u2019re going to continue to play that hand. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Mike Matson : I want to ask one about the Q Guidance System in spine. It sounds like it\u2019s doing well. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe give us sort of an overview of it. I know you\u2019ve had navigation systems time before. Is this something kind of different, or is it more just the latest version? And then how does it kind of fit in when you do bring Mako into spine? Kevin Lobo : Yes. What I\u2019d tell you is this has the fastest camera on the market. Homegrown, we didn\u2019t use a third party to do this camera. It is lightning quick. And that camera will eventually be ported to the Mako as well. So that make will have that same terrific camera. It really -- the user experience is terrific in terms of being able to see and be able to do your procedure. So, the feedback we\u2019ve gotten is outstanding. So, we\u2019ve always been good at navigation, but this is sort of really putting our best foot forward. And this user experience that you\u2019re going to have with Q will transfer to the Mako spine, and that we\u2019re really excited about. So this is -- this even before Mako is already having an impact. And we think once Mako\u2019s launched, it will really fill this important need in the market for us to have a robotic application. We also have another product in enabling technology coming out of our instruments vision that\u2019s going to be used by the Spine group. A little early for me to give you details on what that is. But at the appropriate time, we\u2019ll tell you about that. So that, combined with Mako is going to give us very compelling enabling technology platform for Spine. Mike Matson : Okay. Got it. And then just given the guidance, I assume this is early, kind of material issue, but I thought I\u2019d ask about it anyway because we\u2019ve heard about it from some other companies. But can you just comment on any Russia exposure you have and whether or not there\u2019s the latest sanctions are having any sort of impact on your business? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Obviously, we\u2019re abiding by all the sanctions, as you would expect, and working in lockstep with the industry on industry-wide response to what should be humanitarian products and should be -- should they go through the approval process. That\u2019s obviously very lengthy. It did have a negative impact. But honestly, our Russia business is so small that it\u2019s kind of meaningless in the overall picture of Stryker. But yes, we are abiding by the sanctions. Yes, it did have a negative impact, but it was really -- it\u2019s not a material business for Stryker. Operator : Our last question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Richard Newitter : Congrats on the quarter. Kevin, I think a few months back in the first quarter, you were asked a question at an investor conference about what areas could be of interest to you? There\u2019s so much going, right, across your existing businesses. So obviously, M&A, though, is still top of mind. So I\u2019m just curious kind of where are the holes? And where do you think the investment could be most incremental for you? Kevin Lobo : Look, it\u2019s a good question. I think I\u2019ve talked about the adjacencies that we\u2019re interested in. First and foremost, there\u2019s a lot of tuck-in demand. Each of our businesses are building their wish lists and sort of evaluating different targets. And I think that\u2019s job one is looking at those near-term targets that tuck-in. Those create tremendous financial returns for Stryker. They don\u2019t always move the needle for the overall growth, but they\u2019re really terrific financials for us to do. And when you feed our existing sales force of Stryker, we know how to sell, and we\u2019re able to really do that very, very well. I would tell you, in the adjacency space, no change to the adjacencies that we\u2019re interested in. I think I\u2019ve mentioned them before. What I would tell you is neuromodulation\u2019s one I\u2019ve talked about in the past. And within neuromodulation, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of different parts to that. There\u2019s spinal cord stimulation, there\u2019s deep brain stimulation, there\u2019s peripheral nerve stimulation, and stimulation as you know in sleep apnea. And I do believe electrical treatment is going to be a big part of the future. Over time, we\u2019ve been a little hot cold on spinal cord stimulation. I would tell you right now, we\u2019re probably a little bit more cold on it, just kind of a challenging market and -- so that\u2019s the way the only thing maybe I haven\u2019t said in the past. But otherwise, every other adjacency that I talked about in Q1 are still very much on our radar screen. And as our cash frees up, probably more into next year. If the tuck-ins aren\u2019t of a significant size and we have cash starting to build up and our debt position better, hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to make a move in one of those adjacencies that I\u2019ve talked about in the past. Richard Newitter : Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on Spine. It\u2019s one of the few businesses that\u2019s not back in the high single digits or better yet but you obviously have pretty good line of sight to seemingly transformative technologies and product rollouts with Mako, but that\u2019s 1 year, 1.5 years away. So I guess, do we just kind of think of spine as a grind from here higher or stabilization and then look out when \u201825 comes around? Kevin Lobo : Yes. I think the word stabilization, I\u2019d probably prefer that than grind, but yes, it\u2019s probably both, right? So Spine is a tough market, no question about it. But already with Q Guidance, we\u2019re feeling good about that. We\u2019ve bolstered our expandable portfolio a bit. We still have a couple of gaps that we\u2019re looking at. Obviously, we would like to fill. But the enabling tech is really what gets us excited. And so I think the robotic platform will put us on a par at least with the competitors and then this other secret launch I talked about from coming out of instruments, which we\u2019ve shown some surgeons kind of will put us ahead of the game on enabling technology. But yes, we have to wait. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not ready yet. It\u2019s coming. The instrument launch will probably come in before the Mako, and that will be able to be used with the Q Guidance. It will be compatible with Q. So that\u2019s where -- you\u2019ll hear about that probably earlier than you\u2019ll hear about Mako. But yes, I wouldn\u2019t assume we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to try to kind of keep in line with market growth, which is kind of what we\u2019re doing right now, hold our own until we get to that period of time, and then we could start to grow more like a typical business of Stryker. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in early November. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s Stryker\u2019s second quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Krista, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. Before I discuss the quarter, I would like to address the concerns around GLP-1 and what is being misunderstood. Our knee business is not at risk for a slowdown. There is an oversimplification taking place as it relates to the relationship between weight and knee replacements. This ignores the more important aspects of activity level and genetics. We are, in fact, optimistic about the positive impacts of these drugs in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, it will help to make ineligible people eligible for surgery sooner. And in the long term, it will likely lead to more surgery as people increase their activity levels. With that said, the rate and persistence of adoption of these medicines is still a large unknown as there are significant barriers to this taking place.  Lastly, as a reminder, we have a very diversified business, with knees representing about 10% of our sales. Now moving to our third quarter results. We delivered strong organic sales growth of 9.2% against last year's nearly 10% comparable despite one less selling day versus 2022. This performance included double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopedics and Spine, reflecting a sustained robust demand environment and our team's strong commercial execution. Our results were strong across the globe with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets. In addition, we remain focused on our pricing initiatives, once again realizing positive overall price. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.46, reflecting a 16% growth compared to the third quarter of 2022. This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also demonstrates continued margin recovery.  Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2023 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now expect full year organic sales growth of 10% to 10.5% and earnings per share of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. Coming off full year 2022 organic sales growth of nearly 10%, a 10-plus percent organic sales growth in 2023 reflects the strength of our of innovation, and our team's sustained high performance, and we are encouraged by an important step in our margin improvement this year. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes remain strong, and we continue to expect patient backlog will support elevated orthopedic procedural demand through 2024. And while hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, these challenges are resolving gradually and will continue to be a tailwind through the end of the year and into 2024. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in our Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. Our capital order backlog remains consistent with Q2 and elevated well above normal levels. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and international installations, which will continue to drive our hips and knees business. Next, our product super cycle continues to drive positive momentum. In Q3, our 1788 camera platform moved to its full launch, which is gaining traction in the market and driving strong order growth. In addition, we received 510(k) approval for our Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division. Pangea will be the largest launch in trauma's history and is a very comprehensive system that will facilitate complete hospital conversions. We are gearing up for a full launch in the second quarter of 2024. We have also extended the capabilities of our Vocera platform to now be compatible with our newly approved Prime Connect stretchers, the first wireless stretcher on the market. This wireless feature can be added to existing and new stretchers and will help address patient safety in the emergency room setting. These launches will continue to support our growth for multiple years. Our Mako spine and shoulder applications are on track, and we've received positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to the technology.  As a reminder, on November 8, we are hosting our Investor Day with the theme : Delivering Leading Growth, which will be webcast live on the Investor Relations page at stryker.com. We will have prepared remarks from numerous leaders across Stryker, followed by a guided product tour for those attending live. We will showcase several of our exciting product launches with investors and analysts having the opportunity to interact with many members of our leadership. We're excited to provide our priorities and expectations for Stryker in the coming years. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9.2% in the quarter, the third quarter of 2023 had one less selling day than 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.3%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 9.3%. International organic sales growth was 8.9% and impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Europe and emerging markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.46 in the quarter was up 16% from 2022 driven by higher sales, operating margin expansion and a lower adjusted income tax rate, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.02.  Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 10.3% and organic sales growth of 10.1% which included 10.9% of U.S. organic growth and 7.4% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.3%, and with strong double-digit growth across both its Surgical Technologies and Orthopedic instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Power Tools, SteriShield Waste Management smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.6% with strong double-digit growth in its communications and sustainability businesses. In September, the Endoscopy business continued its full launch of the 1788 camera system, which provided strong sales momentum at the end of the quarter. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 5.7%, led by performances in its emergency care and stage businesses and was impacted by a strong comparable -- growth comparable in 2022 of almost 14%.  Medical continues to have a large backlog of capital orders, and we expect a solid Q4 despite a huge Q4 comparable. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 8.7%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14.5% which included double-digit growth in all 3 business units, neurosurgical, CMF and ENT. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 7.4% and reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments, endoscopy and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Europe and most emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 6.9% in the U.S. and 10.6% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 5.3% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. hip business grew 3% organically, reflecting solid primary HIF growth fueled by our insignia hip Sam. The growth for both our knee and hip businesses reflects one less selling day in the quarter and a very strong comparable in 2022 of 12.4% per hips and 14% for knees. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.5% organically with strong performances across all businesses, led by upper extremities and foot and ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.4%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses including the recently launched Q guidance navigation system. Our U.S. other ortho increased organically by 1.8% due to higher Mako placements in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.6% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.7% was favorable, approximately 210 basis points from the third quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in 2022, decreases in spot by purchases and the benefit of price and mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which represents a 30 basis point decrease from the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a higher comparable in 2022 related to the ramping of cost for product launches. Our adjusted SG&A was 34.5% of sales, which was 140 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. We expect our full year SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth.  In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 23.4% of sales, which was approximately 110 basis points favorable to the third quarter of 2022. This performance is driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin. Adjusted other income and expense of $61 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense partially offset by higher interest income. The third quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of debt. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.2 billion, this performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections.  Considering our year-to-date results, our robust backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedure trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%. We expect pricing to be slightly positive for the full year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.10 to $0.15 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.45 per share. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, you may begin. Lawrence Biegelsen : Congrats on another good quarter here. Kevin or Glenn, you're guiding to over 10% organic growth this year. What are some of the puts and takes to consider for next year on the top line in the bottom line. Any color on currency at this time. And we've seen a lot of companies increase their tax rate beyond '23 or guide to higher tax rate beyond '23. Anything we should be aware of with Stryker. And I had one quick follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Larry, I'll start out here and then Kevin can pile on. First of all, we're super excited about 10% to 10.5% growth for the full year 2023. And stay tuned to January, and we'll guide on 2024. As I think about currency, it's -- it was a little bit of a headwind in Q3. It's a little bit of a headwind in Q4. We don't necessarily think that it's going to get worse, but it's probably going to stay right where it is. We'll assess that for 2024 when we get to January for that guidance. And then on tax, we just continue to have some favorability on some of our discrete items and also the way our sort of global mix of taxable income is rolling up, and that has helped us tax as it relates to Pillar 2, at this point, we're not projecting really anything negative next year, if you think about our overall tax position. But of course, we'll include that in our guidance early next year. Thinking ahead, I keep talking about the super cycle of innovation. And it is really in full swing. You've seen that with the camera launch. You saw that with the amazing instruments performance in Q3 on the backs of the Neptune S launch and the power tool launch, which is really gaining momentum. And then we've got a very exciting next-generation professional defibrillator launch starting early next year. So we feel very good about our momentum really driven behind innovation and strong commercial execution. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And just one on the margins. I know you're going to talk about the long term, sprinting back to pre-COVID operating margins to next week at the analyst meeting. So I don't -- I know you're not going to front run that. But my question is, how much visibility do you have? And what's driving that getting back to pre-COVID margins? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. That's a good question, Larry. And we will give you more color on it next week at the analyst meeting. What I can say for now, though, is that we have pretty good visibility to the sort of our supply chain our raw material purchases. To the extent possible, we enter fixed contracts related to the pricing of that, which certainly impacts our outlook for 2024. We're not seeing any more spot buys. They basically have gone away for Q3. And so we do feel pretty positive about that. We're also feeling better about our freight as things get a little more normalized, and we're seeing less expediting of raw materials or even products. So we're in a good position there. I would tell you that all of this has a backdrop of inflation that we know we have to offset as we move forward. And as we sprint back to 2019. So we are working on that. Part of the strategy around that has really been a lot of the positive momentum that we've seen in pricing, and we will continue to work on our pricing strategies as we enter next year. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. I wanted to start on Ortho and hips and knees, and we've seen this a lot this quarter with increased seasonality. Wondering if you could speak to the trends in the quarter. Do you think you're still gaining share? And do you expect normal seasonality to return in fourth quarter? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. I'll take this question. I would say we did see what I'll call the more normal seasonality after the last few years of turbulence, starting with the pandemic. And so what that means is we think Q4 is going to be strong, seasonally strong as it was going back to '17, '18, '19. We're already seeing that kind of with the month of October. So I think we're doing fine. Our business is -- did not surprise us in terms of the results that we had. And obviously, we had giant comps from last year. If you look at the growth we had in Q3 of last year, feel very good about our position in both hips and knees and expect to have a good fourth quarter. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe following up, same line of thought. Other ortho had a nice quarter. Maybe you could just speak to trends in robotics and Mako and placements and just the capital equipment environment overall? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, the capital equipment environment overall is healthy. And you see that in Endoscopy and Instruments numbers, even medical. The full year medical is going to be double-digit growth. It will be our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in medical. Obviously, Q3 was a little softer than Q2, which was huge. And large capital does -- will vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the environment is healthy. You saw the OUS numbers for other ortho are very big. So Mako is really picking up in both Asia Pacific as well as EMEA. But what we are -- so overall, just tremendous momentum across our business on the capital side. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : It's Pito. On the margins. I realized that you're not giving us margins sort of for 2024 yet. So focus on the third quarter gross margins. Can you bridge us on how you grew 220 basis points year-over-year. And how that compares to the guidance last quarter about gradual margin improvement. Are there any one timers in there? Because you're already sort of within 100 basis points of where you were in third quarter '19. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. There's a couple of pieces here. Obviously, one of the pieces is where we were a year ago as you looked at Q3 and the impacts we were feeling pretty severely from spot buys. Fast forward to where we are now, we're not seeing any spot buys. A lot of that is flushed through the income statement already. So that's some given improvement right there. We're also seeing sort of a more normalization of supply chain management. So a lot of that means we can get back to things like ocean freight and not air freighting all the time. We can have regular manufacturing scheduling and cadence which means that we don't have people cycling in and out, which is really inefficient. And so I think that combined a little bit with sort of the mix that we saw within the quarter just really helped us give a lift to the gross margin. I mean we still expect gradual improvement. And I think that's what you'll see. Keep in mind for Q4, seasonally, it's a big MS&T quarter. And so we'll feel that mix impact in Q4 in the gross margin. Philip Chickering : Okay. And the follow-up question, like you talked about a big backlog in medical. Are you seeing hospital CapEx continue to grow as margins improve from hospitals? Or are you seeing any impact in the rising rate environment and/or additional pressure on physician compensation changing of hospitals to CapEx in the near term? Jason Beach : Peter, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I think just to build on what Kevin said from a capital environment standpoint, it continues to be strong for us. And I think just to remind you, as you think about our capital, right, the large percentage of our capital is this revenue-generating capital that has to be replaced with procedures. And so that continues to be strong. And then, again, to Kevin's point on Medical, as you think about a double-digit year, the large capital continues to be strong. So really no change of tone for us as it relates to the capital environment. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : Number one, can you quantify the impact of the fewer selling days. And number two, you said that the shoulder and spine applications or may go on track. Could you remind us what on track means? And how do you see those products adopting and ramping over time? Kevin Lobo : Okay. Great. Thanks, Joanne. What we've always said about a 1-day impact, it's roughly 1% total company. It obviously has a higher impact on implants than it does on capital equipment. But approximately a 1% total company impact. And we benefited from a day earlier in the year, I think it was Q1. And then this quarter, we lost today. The full year will be the same number of days. What we said around the timing is we expect Mako spine kind of around the middle of the year next year. That's on track. We were able to show that to some surgeons at NASS and got very good feedback on that. And that product will obviously be -- there will be a Mako application, which I've gotten to see, which is terrific. But it will also include an additional product that's coming out of our insurance division that will be used by spine surgeons as well. So we'll have a pretty tremendous ecosystem. And then shoulder will be towards the end of the year. We'll have an initial launch of shoulder. So those are the time lines we communicated previously, and we are pacing on track on both of those products. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Kevin, maybe on that last question on the Mako spine and shoulder, can you compare and contrast what a Mako application for spine and shoulder, what the launch curve should look like versus hip and knees. Are there any differences between hip and knee surgeons versus the spine market and shorter market? Kevin Lobo : Well, I wouldn't say there's much of a difference, to be honest with you. In the case of Spine, you have to remember, we were first, right? So Mako was first. And when you're first, the uptake tends to be a little slower, to be honest. Overcoming people's objections, having to have to change management. I think if we think about spine, there are already a couple of players in the market, and we already have a very large footprint of robots in the market. So to me, that should be a faster ramp than what we saw with hips and knees. Shoulder will be different. It will be a first-time application with including bone preparation. So I think that one will probably be slower in terms of its uptake, but our shoulder business doesn't really need it. It's growing. It's been strong double digits for a long time and will continue to have an amazing pipeline. They launched a pyrocarbon product. We have the patient magical anode we have mixed reality. I mean there's just so many new products in shoulder. It's not exactly like we needed to drive high growth, but it will be, I think, very impactful. But it will -- because it involves change management, that one will probably go a little bit slower, but Spine, and especially the way we've designed it. The workflow is very, very seamless. It's very, very efficient. It's smooth. And again, it's not the first one. So I think Spine will probably be a faster uptick. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. And maybe, Glenn, one for you. The gross margin performance was pretty impressive in the quarter. When you look at the Q1 to Q3 sequential ramp here, is Q3 the right jump-off point because some of the elements you mentioned looks like they seem to be sustainable. I think free cash conversion related to that I think you had some inventory impact, should that go down for next year and see a more normalized conversion? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, as I said, you're right, Q3 was a very strong performance in gross margin for a lot of those reasons that I talked about. I do think you got to look at sort of first of all, seasonality relative to our gross margin, and we talked about that for the amount of MS&T that will flow through. So I do expect Q4 will moderate just a little just because of that mix issue. And then as we get into next year, we'll talk more about that at the analyst meeting. Vijay Kumar : Great. Sorry. On free cash, would that normalize for next year? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I mean we've always targeted between 70% and 80% for free cash flow. And I don't expect that we would move away from that target. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Shagun Chadha : Kevin, there's a lot of excitement about your super cycle of innovation and the products that you've already launched or you are yet to ramp. Could you help us better quantify the contribution in '23 and '24? Is it low hundreds of basis points in '24? I think this quarter alone, I think you beat our numbers by between 500 and 700 basis points for those segments. So it translates to about 130 basis points if you apply that to a number for '24. But just trying to do some math there. Any color would be helpful. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Shagun, thanks for the question. We really haven't been in the habit of providing breakouts of the impacts of new products. it really is why we drive at the high end of med tech, why we consistently outperform the market by roughly 300 basis points. That's the formula. Consistent cadence of new products combined with really great sales force execution through our decentralized business units. That's the Stryker model. What's interesting about this cycle is, as you point out, it's probably a little bit of a greater impact coming from organic innovation because so many really impactful products are all launching around the same time. I mean if you look at electronic extremities business, that double-digit growth performance is pretty impressive. And we don't really talk about trauma extremities nearly enough. And then we have this Pangea system, which we showed at the OTA conference recently, just in the last 2 weeks, and the feedback was incredibly positive. Now that won't impact our business until the second quarter of next year, but we are ramping up for the launch.  Feedback from surgeons was amazing. It's the biggest launch they've ever had, which is going to fuel even more growth on top of an already high-performing business. So I think the way to think about it is just we can count on Stryker to outperforming the market very consistently because of these new products and breaking out how much of that versus how much is price on new products and mix. And we're not going to get into parsing those elements. But rest assured that, that is the engine of growth for our company. Shagun Chadha : Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. Can you just remind us how you define Stryker's performance at the high end of med tech. So how do you define that growth range? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Historically, we've said 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market, Shagun. I would say, right now, it's tracking more towards 300 basis points faster. The market has improved clearly versus where it was a few years ago. but we continue to outperform it at that kind of level. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : I want to dovetail on Shagun's Cajuns question and also Larry's earlier question on '24 and asking the way, I appreciate you guys have always been at the higher end of med tech. But Kevin, when you think about some of the puts and takes that you've outlined, be it robust orthopedic demand, offset by some of the staffing issues that we're seeing in hospitals. Do you anticipate '24 to be at a growth rate similar to kind of what we think of as historical net debt growth rates in that 4% to 5% range. Jason Beach : Ryan, it's Jason. I'll just jump in here and then we'll open it up for your follow-up. But as we think about 2024, obviously, we will get into that more in January. I can give you a little bit more detail. But at this point, we won't comment any further in terms of how we're thinking about the top line. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. I had to try it in a different way. So I appreciate it. All right. I'll turn -- I'll shift directions then. And just ask, your head of your knee business just gave an interview actually yesterday that I thought was really interesting. And you disclosed that there's about 300 robots from Mako that is in ASCs today. And I'm wondering where you see that market topping out at or where you see from a socket perspective? I mean if there's 12,000 ASCs in the U.S. today, I mean there's no way that all of them can own a robot, although that would be nice to think I guess I'm curious kind of as we thought -- as we've seen the ramp of Mako, I mean, initially, it was maybe 2,000 hospitals and then it was potentially all 5,000 hospitals in the U.S. it's early days in ASC, but where do you think that can go over time as you sit here today? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, Mako is performing extremely well in the ASC. And just as a reminder, right now, at our hip and knees procedures roughly, call it, 12% of those are being done in ASCs. That number is growing dramatically and will continue to grow dramatically. And as surgeons move their business to the ASC, they do not want to suffer. They want the best technology, they want Mako. So I see tremendous upside in Makos in the ASC because they want to be able to do it, it lends itself very well. There's less instruments, which means less pressure on sterilization, which is a major bottleneck within ASCs. They don't have the same room for sterilization that hospitals do. So it's actually a very, very effective product to have in the ASC. And so as that percentage of 12% moves and based on different pundits, it's somewhere between 30%, 40%, as that goes higher, you're going to see more and more robots being installed in these ASCs.  So there is a significant upside in front of us here in the United States. And frankly, ASCs, now they're starting to talk about it in multiple countries in Europe. In Switzerland, they're talking about it in Germany, they're talking about and in the U.K. They're starting to figure out that this model is actually a good model for the delivery of health care. Good for surgeons, good for staff. Staff, frankly, nurses love going to ASCs. We're having less issues on staffing and surgery centers than we are in hospitals and good for the patients. Patients actually like going to a place where there aren't sick people and where there's easy parking and where you can go home the same day. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Kevin, that Mako line this quarter was pretty eye-popping. So I'm kind of wondering, J&J launched the system at WS this year. I'm not sure it's all that great. But -- but Zimmer was pushing as well. Did you see a pause in the market with some of those dynamics? And then that's kind of behind you now and you're winning a disproportionate share of Mako sales placements? And then specifically within there, are you getting more of those placements into competitive accounts that you have historically? Or is it still kind of a reasonable mix between existing shrinker accounts and then competitive. Kevin Lobo : Yes. We're not really seeing much of a change in the mix between competitive and, let's call it, Stryker-friendly accounts. It's pretty similar as it's been, frankly, throughout the launch. There really hasn't -- it's really people who want technology, and are really looking for the best that they can get. And what we saw with the competitive products came on the market is we saw a little bit of a slowdown as they evaluated side-by-side different companies. But it was pretty modest. And I would say now, really, we're not concerned about comparison side by side. We frankly encourage that, that they look at the product side by side. We really believe we have the best solution for hip and knee replacement in the same robot. And then, of course, look forward to adding other applications, again, to the same robot with the spine and shoulder in the coming periods. Matthew O\u2019Brien: It makes sense. And then Kevin, again, you touched on this at the beginning, but GLP is a dominated a conversation for all of us on this call. There's some Shanghai data out there about a big reduction in knee replacements in that study, although I'm not sure that study is all that robust. There's another OA study coming out fairly soon that we're all looking at. I'm just curious what Stryker looked at internally that gives you that comfort that you can tell investors confidently that this is not going to be an issue, not necessarily now, but in 2, 3, 5 years from now, and then I don't know if you can talk a little bit about some of these near-term benefits that you're seeing in terms of some patients that have lost weight that are now eligible get a knee or hip replacement. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm not going to use today's call for this because we have an Analyst Day next week in Investor Day, and we're going to have a surgeon there, and we'll actually devote some time to the GLP discussion. What I would tell you is the study is saying that there's going to be a reduction, I think, our nonsense. And here at the August meeting in Dallas right now, spent the morning talking to multiple surgeons at massively credible teaching hospitals, world renowned teaching hospitals who have poured through the research and feel that there is no need for us to worry whatsoever about any slowdown in our knee procedures. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Eric Anderson : This is Eric on for Josh. Looking at spine, there's been some consolidation in the last few quarters. And I was just wondering if you could share a little more detail on your observations in that market. Do you think you're benefiting from any share shifts? Are you making any competitive rev hires? Any detail there would be great. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, it's still early days, if you're thinking about the big consolidation that's occurring, and it's not the only one, right, that the last 4 or 5 years, we've seen quite a bit of consolidation. There's still more operators in spine than we see in some of our other specialties. But I think one of the drivers of the consolidation is enabling technologies. It really is sort of ticket to the dense to be successful long term is having really good enabling technologies. Our Q guidance system, we're delighted with the performance of that with the fastest camera in the market, which we developed internally at Stryker. And that QCard will then be paired with Mako in the future, which is really exciting and will provide an even smaller footprint than what you see with the other spine enabling technology ecosystem. So I think that's really the catalyst for the future is -- and that will probably provide even more consolidation going forward. But as it relates to sales force a little early days right now, not a lot of change. I think you're going to see more of that change as we roll into next year when they have to decide who's in which territory, in which person. They're sort of holding things constant for now. but that disruption will come, and we look forward to taking advantage of that however we can. Eric Anderson : Understood. And then maybe on M&A, I was just curious to hear your latest thoughts on deals given the current market environment. And secondly, are there any areas of the portfolio organic growth? Kevin Lobo : Yes. First of all, I would say today, every division has targets for inorganic growth. So the -- we have a decentralized business development model at Stryker. And every division has a list of companies, and they're just waiting for our cash position to improve such that we can start doing more deals. Obviously, we've done a couple of deals this year between the Cerus deal and the Palm deal within our Instruments division. But we are lining up targets. There are numerous opportunities. The landscape is pretty rich with targets. Valuations, in some cases, have come down, which is not a bad thing. But on the other hand, interest rates have gone up. So the hurdle rate to achieve the right level of financials is raised a little bit. But we're feeling good. We're paying down debt in line with what we had committed to the rating agencies. And Glenn, how do you feel about our willingness to start doing deals? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, I think we -- we will live up to our commitments and assertions relative to our debt position at the point we get to the end of this year. And so to Kevin's point, there's a long list from all of our divisions in terms of potential acquisitions. I wouldn't say that we really sort of sat on our hands during this period of time. We have engaged with several companies to look at the possibilities. So I do think that M&A is a big part of our growth strategy moving forward, and I'm certain that we'll pick up the pace in 2024. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : Just a quick follow-up on the M&A question. Just curious if you'd put a little bit of framework around some of the size of deals you're willing to do or what we should kind of expect when you move into some of the larger deals you've commented on in '24. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, M&A is very fluid. We're not going to really comment on size of deals. Over time, obviously, the larger volume of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but our debt-to-equity ratio is getting right around close to that 2.5 level. That's a nice level to be -- to hit. And once we hit that level, then we have the freedom to be able to do what I call main course size deals. I think we've been on an appetizer diet towards the end of last year and into this year. And we have the capacity to be able to do $1 billion deals if they present themselves and if the returns are strong. So not going to predict exactly what will happen, but we're going to get back to kind of our normal offense in M&A that you saw for the last 10 years prior to the big spending on right Medical in Vocera. Travis Steed : Great. That's helpful. And then I know you're not going to give the answer, but just curious if you kind of level set what we should expect at the Analyst Day. Are you going to give some sort of revenue and margin long-range plan? It sounds like '24 guidance won't be until January. Just curious if we kind of level set what we should expect there. Jason Beach : Yes, Trav, this is Jason. A couple of comments I would say. First off, to your point, as it relates to specifically 2024, we'll get into that more in January. As you think about Investor Day next week. It will be kind of the more of the long-range plan. We've certainly talked about sprinting back to 2019 margins. You'll hear more about that and when we'll get back there. And then also just how we think about growth over the next 3 years as well. So -- but again, we'll narrow in on 2024 in January. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Truth Bank. Richard Newitter : Just coming off at a couple of weeks ago, I figured that ask a question on the Spine robot. It sounds like you guys are still very optimistic on the timing for a launch, I guess, I think it's in half of next year. Just correct me if I'm wrong on that. we heard from Medtronic, they've already got and adapted the Mazor system to get to a bone-cutting capability. I'd love to just hear what kind of capability should we expect with your initial launch from an indication standpoint, should we expect you to be at a point where others second, third, fourth generations are -- or are you going to be starting off walk before you can run pedicle screws and stay tuned. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, yes, we're targeting kind of, let's call it, Q3 for the spine robot on Mako. What I'd say is that we -- the Mako launch for spine will be for Pedicle group placement, but it is a fabulous workflow faster than what's on the market today. and smoother. So I'm really pleased with what I've seen with our Mako Spine robot. In addition, I keep mentioning we have this additional product that will be launched within the same ecosystem using the same navigation card that does bone cutting. It is not specifically the Mako product. It's a different product, but it operates within the same ecosystem. So I believe that we'll go from today being behind being ahead of the market with the launch of those two. And those two products are coming at the same time. So the other product, the bone cutting product will arrive at the same time as Mako and provide a really fabulous ecosystem. Richard Newitter : Okay. And then just on augmented reality, can we assume that the application you have in shoulder, I think, for right now, that's going to go to other orthopedic areas. Do you have any time lines for that? Or is that something we'll hear more about next week. Kevin Lobo : Look, I'm not sure we're going to tell you a lot more about it next week, but we're big believers. And well, the term we use is mistreality so that we can actually sort of see through the rest of the room and also see the screens. We're big believers in mixed reality. It's going to be a big part of the future. So you don't have to look sideways when you're doing procedures, you look right into the into the surgical field. But I'm not sure we're ready to give you time lines on that. But that's something we believe is going to be powerful. We're already seeing some of the value with shoulder, and we have every intention of expanding that to other applications in the years ahead. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ranieri : Kevin, for you, you were talking about your strong U.S. and OUS knees replacement growth. But you're also talking about change management when it comes to maybe the spine or the shoulder application. When you do think about OUS geographies for Mako, can you just talk about the utilization that you do see for hips and knees because there's a bit of a change management there. Robotics is fairly new OUS. But are you seeing any type of acceleration compared to what you saw in the early days of U.S. launch? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, we're right now in Asia Pacific and even outside of, let's say, the U.K., the -- let's call it the rest of EMEA. We're kind of right now where we were 5, 6 years ago in the United States. So we're seeing an inflection point. We're seeing things really start to take off in -- not in Australia because that was a fast adopter. But in Japan, for sure, in India for sure, in some of the other European countries where it's really starting to take off. And it's kind of the inflection point. We saw this sort of terrific growth here in the U.S., started about 5, 6 years ago. That is now starting to happen in these other markets, really, really exciting. And you see that with the other ortho number, just kind of starting to pop. And you see that in the hip-and-knee business, the growth that we're seeing internationally, I think that's going to be a gift that will keep on giving for the next few years because it took us a while, honestly, to get going in some of these markets, and we're now starting to hit our stride and feeling very bullish about the future make on.  This is just with hips and knees forget about not even thinking about spine and shoulder, just -- it was -- it just took a little longer to get surgeons on board to figure out the model, to get the MPS training, to get the language translation, there's all these steps we had to sort of go through we've been through that, and now we're starting to really realize terrific growth. And I think that will continue in the years ahead. Andrew Ranieri : Maybe I'll save this one for next week, but just on GLP-1, just talking to a couple of ortho surgeons ourselves. I got the sense that they actually do heavier BMI patients still manually versus robotics. If you do actually see a near-term benefit as these patients do lose weight, would you expect to see more of a mix benefit on Mako or just kind of a rising tide lifts all ships for your knee business. Kevin Lobo : Yes. To me, it's a rising tide lifts all ships. And whether they do manually or doing with Mako, that's really a surgeon choice. It's not really tied to how thin or how heavy somebody is, whether they choose to do it manure to robotically. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you so much. And I actually had a question, I'm sure you guys will talk about this more next week, so sorry if I'm front-running that. But international looks pretty strong this quarter. Just curious about what you can say, what's driving that growth and how sustainable is that? And then the second part of the question is on the orthopedic backlog and whether the magnitude of the backlog this quarter versus last and the quarter prior, has come down. Appreciate you believe it's going to continue to contribute into 2024. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that contribution going forward, how we should think about that. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. Listen, I'm super excited about international. As you know, we've now hadfive consecutive years of international growing faster than U.S. This year, we're on pace to be the sixth consecutive year. And as I mentioned earlier on the call, Mako is only just starting to really gain steam in a lot of international markets. Our camera business is gaining steam in the international market. So I think we're really poised and next week, we -- as part of our agenda, we have an international panel that we're going to hold. We have a number of our leaders from our international markets will be there on the panel and even available in the walk around time to be able to chat with all of the investors and analysts. So we feel bullish about international. That has not always been the case. If you remember 10 years ago, that was a sore spot for us. it's still a source of tremendous upside. If you look at our business, over 70% of our sales are still in the United States. So we still have tremendous potential in international, and that should last for a long time to come. And then the second part, Jason. Jason Beach : Yes, I'll take the second part here, Danielle. So as it relates to kind of procedural backlog, and similar to what I said in my prepared remarks, procedures are strong, right? And so as we think about kind of Q4 and into next year, I'm not going to try to quantify in terms of percentages of growth that comes with that. But we do think that we'll remain elevated kind of well into next year. And every quarter, we reassess that based on intelligence that we have, talking to surgeons, et cetera. But we do expect it will continue to be a moderate tailwind into next year. Operator : The last question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Yang Li : This is Yang Li in for Matt. I guess to start, I was wondering price was positive this quarter, continuing the trend from early in the year. I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable do you think the positive price momentum can be going forward? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. You're right. Q3 kind of continued our favorable pricing trend with sort of 0.3% coming off of Q2, that was 0.5%. And A couple of comments I would say. As we look at the full year, we think that will be positive for the full year. And we also have put in place kind of the incentive process as well as the contracting process to really make sure that we're considering price as we think about working with our customers on buying products. So I feel good that we have the sort of mechanism that is going to continue to look at price. That being said, you're absolutely right. We'll anniversary on product over product year-over-year, which may make things a little bit tougher.  One thing that I would keep in mind though, that Kevin talks about this product super cycle and a lot of next-gen products coming out. So if you think about our pricing calculation of statistic, it really doesn't include the impact of price increases that we get on those products because of the technologies that they're bringing to market. So I think that is actually an element of pricing that's going to help us as we think about next year. And I don't think it's something going to walk away from as long as inflation is having an impact, we'll continue to have those discussions with our customers about pricing. Yang Li : All right. Great. And then, I guess, for the follow-up, I wanted to hear a little bit more on potentially hiring more robotic or capital reps ahead of the shoulder and in robotic launches. I wanted to maybe get a better sense of how you'd be entering the market. Is it more of a hybrid sales process with the clinical reps? I mean I would assume you would focus initially on the existing customers, but maybe how long before you start going on offense and try to convert surgeons with Mako? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, we have a very dedicated sales force offense that we run. So even before you think about spine or shoulder, even within joint replacement, we had specialized capital salespeople. We have the same thing with power tools. We have specialized people that sell power tools. So we don't believe in this hybrid model, we're going to have dedicated capital reps, and they will go to the market and they will sell to competitive and new surgeons right out of the gate. That's what they do. And that's what we do at Stryker. So I wouldn't expect that we would just go to our friendlies. We're going to go to people that want technology, and we really don't care if they're existing customers or if they're competitive customers because the -- there really is -- we don't like to have implant reps also selling capital. It's just not our model. And so we think we can solve more and faster if we have these dedicated people, and we'll have that dedicated approach as we add additional applications to make. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Investor Day with you on November 8 and our fourth quarter and full year results with you in January 2024. Thank you. Operator : This call has concluded. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, MAKO performance insights and updates on recent acquisitions. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2024 guidance before opening the call to Q&A. First, I want to recognize and celebrate our achievement of surpassing $20 billion in sales. We continue to be a high-growth company with a focus on our mission to deliver for our patients and customers. As we begin 2024, I am very excited about our future. We are in a strong position with robust demand across both procedures and capital, easing macro constraints and a strong pipeline of innovation. I want to thank our over 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination, agility and performance. We've delivered terrific sales growth of over 11% in Q4 and the full year despite strong comparatives from the prior year. Our commercial execution, including many successful product introductions was excellent across our businesses and regions. Globally, for both Q4 and the full year, we had double-digit organic sales growth in instruments, endoscopy, medical, neuro cranial, hips, knees and trauma and extremities. For the full year, we also had double-digit organic sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally. Spine and neurovascular also demonstrated good performances while making notable advancements in future innovations and acquisitions. It was a comprehensive performance across our businesses, and we have built significant momentum entering 2024. For the sixth straight year, our international sales growth, excluding China VBP outpaced our strong U.S. business. Canada, Australia and most emerging markets had double-digit growth, while Europe and Japan grew in high single digits. International continues to be a large growth opportunity for us. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3.46 and $10.60, respectively, which represents 15% growth for Q4 and 13% growth compared to the full year of 2022. This was driven by our strong sales, but also demonstrates our continued operating margin recovery. We remain focused on driving high growth now and in the future through investments in organic innovation and M&A. We expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of medtech, which is reflected in our full year 2024 guidance of organic sales growth of 7.5% to 9%. This growth, combined with an accelerated margin expansion plan, translates to an adjusted EPS of $11.70 to $12 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as MAKO, Vocera and our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF. During the quarter, we saw strong procedural demand. We continue to expect the ortho markets will remain strong in 2024, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a more favorable pricing environment and healthy patient activity levels with surgeons. While supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe, our supply is stable overall and gradually improving. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very robust in the quarter with double-digit organic growth in medical, instruments and endoscopy. Hospital CapEx budgets remain healthy, and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2024. Next, specific to MAKO, we had a record quarter of installations globally. The progress of our MAKO offense, including our recent direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw 60% of knees and 34% of hips performed using MAKO as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 40% of knees and nearing 20% of hips performed using MAKO. We have momentum, and a significant opportunity remains as MAKO adoption increases. We are nearing the two-year anniversary of our Vocera acquisition and remain very excited about the acquired assets, as it provides a platform for us to be at the intersection of medical devices, software and clinical support. With integration activities now complete, which included a migration towards the cloud as well as the commercial reorganization, we are pleased with the accelerating double-digit sales and order growth achieved as we exited the year. In 2023, we saw many cross-sell wins, including new bed business leveraging Vocera. Also, we completed the seamless experience created between the Vocera platform and both ProCuity and our new wireless structure. This year and beyond will bring even more integrations and enhancements with a focus on scalability, user experience, automated workflow and documentation. We expect strong double-digit annual sales growth to continue for years to come, and we are excited to have Vocera as part of the Stryker family. Lastly, we are progressing with our recently announced agreement to acquire SERF, and we expect the deal will close this quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.4% in the quarter, compared to 13.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 has the same number of selling days as 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.3% favorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12.7%. International organic sales growth was 7.7%, against a very strong comparable of over 18% in 2022. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan and most emerging markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 11.5%, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7% and international organic sales growth of 10.9%. Excluding the impact of China VBP, international growth was 12.8%. The impact for pricing in the year was favorable 0.6%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact, and 2023 as the same number of selling days as 2022. Our adjusted EPS of $3.46 in the quarter was up 15.3% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion, as well as lower other income and expenses. Foreign currency exchange translation had a favorable impact of $0.02. Our full year adjusted EPS was $10.60, which represents growth of 13.5% from full year 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.10. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.8%, which included 13.8% of U.S. organic growth and 5.7% of international growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.5%, with strong double-digit growth across its Surgical Technology and Orthopedic Instruments businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, SteriShield, smoke evacuation and surg account. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 17.9%, with double-digit growth in its Communications, Endo, BEU and Sports Medicine businesses. From a product perspective, this includes strong growth in booms, lights and video. During the quarter, the Endoscopy business continued to see very strong momentum of the 1788 camera system, which had its full launch in September. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by performances in its Vocera, Acute Care and Sage businesses. This included strong growth in Vocera badges, beds, stretchers and Prevalon repositioning products. All of this was against a very strong comparable growth of over 20% in 2022. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 14%, which included double-digit growth in the neurosurgical and ENT businesses, with strong growth in high-speed drill and balloon dilation products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in our instruments and neurocranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Australia, Canada and Japan. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.7%, which included organic growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and 10.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 12.9% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business also grew 12.9% organically, reflecting solid primary hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 12.1% organically, with strong performances across all of its businesses, including Upper Extremities, Biologics, Core Trauma, and Foot and Ankle. Our U.S. Spine business grew 6%, led by the performance in our Enabling Technology and Interventional Spine businesses. Internationally, Orthopedics and Spine grew 10.1% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by Mako and strong Knee performance across most geographies. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorably \u2013 was favorable approximately 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the continued easing of certain cost pressures, including the elimination of spot buy purchases that we experienced in 2022, and the continued benefit of pricing initiatives. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.6% of sales, which was 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Our adjusted SG&A was 31% of sales, which was 40 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022 due to continued investments, including sales growth incentives and a more normalized cadence of travel and meetings. In summary, for the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 27.2% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales, a 40 basis points increase over 2022. This performance is mainly driven by the easing of certain gross margin cost pressures throughout the second half of the year as well as the positive impact of our pricing actions. Adjusted other income and expense of $31 million for the quarter was $23 million lower than 2022, mainly driven by higher interest income and other favorable discrete items. For 2024, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $250 million. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% and 14.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $13 billion. During the year, we paid down the remaining $850 million outstanding on the $1.5 billion term loan associated with the Vocera acquisition and achieved our deleveraging commitments. In Q4, we also refinanced certain debt maturities, including prefunding of $600 million that is due in May 2024. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was $3.7 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. For 2024, we anticipate that capital spending will be $650 million to $700 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide 2024 full year sales and earnings guidance. Based on our momentum from 2023, strong procedural volumes, healthy demand for capital products and a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 9% for 2024. There is one additional selling day in 2024 compared to 2023, with one less day in Q1 and one more day in both Q3 and Q4. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be modestly, unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted $0.05 to $0.10. This is included in our guidance. Finally, for the full year 2024, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, representing our commitment to accelerated operating margin expansion in 2024 as well as the stabilized \u2013 stabilizing operating environment. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect seasonality for sales and related earnings to be similar to 2023, but adjusted for the quarterly differences in 2024 selling days. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : At this time we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks and congrats on another fantastic quarter. Kevin, maybe to start, I feel like it's a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, where we were sitting here at exactly this time last year and investors were starting to worry after a good year in 2022. And how good can 2023 be, and now people are wondering about 2024. So I was hoping you could give a little color behind the 7.5% to 9% organic sales growth. How much of that is transitory? How much of that is durable pricing? And any key drivers you could point us to? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. It certainly was a terrific year in 2023. We had 9.7% organic the year before and over 11% organic in 2023. And frankly, we feel very good going into 2024. At some point, you think the comps will start to catch up a little bit. And so we think 7.5% to 9% is a strong guide. I can tell that coming off all of the domestic sales meetings, there is tremendous energy and excitement among our teams. The procedure volumes are strong. The capital markets are very strong. Hospitals are spending. We have we exited the year with more backlog than we began the year, which means, obviously, our orders are continuing to be strong for capital equipment. So we \u2013 and we have a number of new launches, again, planned in 2024. Obviously, 2023 was a great year of capitalizing on product launches, whether it's System 9, whether it was Neptune S, whether it was the 1788. We have other launches coming again. So our pipeline of innovation is very strong. And so I expect us to continue to grow at the high end of MedTech, in a MedTech market that is quite healthy. Robbie Marcus : Great. Maybe, Glenn, a follow-up for you. And I appreciate you don't guide quarterly, but there's a lot you could do to help us get models in the right spot based on what you can say. And I guess, really the question is, my math is implying 50 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. You talked about the top line should look like 2023. And I imagine that looks like a normal comparable quarter and first quarter and maybe some sharper seasonality than historically down 3Q up 4Q. Also, anything down the P&L operating margin that we should be considering in that seasonality? Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think, Robbie \u2013 and I tried to sort of lay this out at the end of my guidance there, but I think a good place to start would be to look at sort of the cadence of sales and earnings in 2023. And really just adjust out for one selling day in Q1 and then adding two on the back end. And so as you look at pay Stryker, how are you going to deliver op margin expansion throughout the year, it's probably a little more back half loaded just based on the cadence that we'll see through the year for sales and related op income. Operator : Our next question will come from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a really strong year and finish to the year. Kevin, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on M&A headed into 2024. Your focus has been on paying down debt in 2023. Is your focus in 2024 on smaller deals? Are you open to considering something larger? And is the target area is the same as the ones you shared at the orthopedic meeting last year? And I had one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Larry. I would say that we're back on M&A offense now, what I'll call our normal M&A offense. And as you've seen in the past with Stryker that would typically mean larger volume of tuck-in deals. And those can be large, and they can also be small. During the pause, while we paid down debt, all of our BD teams worked very actively. Believe me, they have a long list of targets, and we are going to be active now that we've gotten our leverage back to where we'd like to be. So let's say we're back to the normal Stryker offense. Expect us to be doing deals. We are open to larger deals. But our history would tell you that the vast majority of our deals are going to be smaller tuck-ins, but we can do many deals versus being very limited last year. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And Glenn, to follow up on Robbie's question on the margins. First, is it coming \u2013 the margin expansion coming \u2013 how much is coming from gross margin versus operating margin? And are you committed still to the 200 basis points getting back to the pre-COVID margin by 2025? I mean, it actually \u2013 I don't know if the math \u2013 not to get too much into it, but it looks like \u2013 I thought it looks like over 100 basis points implied in the guidance this year. So I assume we can all figure that out off-line, but just any color on gross versus operating margin and the 200 basis points for the two-year, sprinting back to pre-COVID margins would be helpful. Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Larry, I think, first of all, we're not backing off of our sprint to 2019 op margin at all. And we have clearly had a plan to get there by the end of 2025. As I said at Analyst Day, we have good opportunities in operating expenses and in gross margin. I think if you look at our delivery in 2023, we got about 80 basis points out of gross margin and we invested in some operating expenses that we had indicated would get back to sort of normalized spend. So my thoughts on 2024 is that expansion will generally be led by operating expenses, but there continues to be really good opportunities in gross margins that we continue to work on. And if you think about some of these things, price isn't going away from us. We're still going to continue to work on that. Viju elaborated on the benefit we have of low-cost manufacturing sites, and we'll continue to see expansion there. We have opportunities in purchasing and procurement, supplier consolidation. On the OpEx side, we'll continue to expand into shared services in some of these low-cost areas where we have those. And then honestly, from OpEx, we have a lot of natural leverage. It just comes when you're growing at the rate that we're growing. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Yes, thanks for taking the question. So I want to ask about orthopedics. It's just been stellar performance. And we've heard from you and one of your peers. And Kevin, I just would appreciate if you can kind of characterize the confidence that this continues to persist for 2024. And how are you improving or what are you doing to improve potentially productivity on the Mako unit to capture demand that's continuing to be so strong? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. We're delighted with the progress that we've made. 60% of U.S. Knees being done on the robot is pretty remarkable given how long ago we launched the Total Knee application and SNFs starting to really climb since we launched the 4.0 software has been terrific. Cementless continues to climb as well. And that tends to index much higher with the use of Mako. And as you know, we are clearly the leader in not just in robotic-assisted surgery, but clearly the leader in Cementless as well. So a lot of good things going on with a market that is obviously a little better than it has been historically. But Mako continues to be the engine of growth, and that's true in the hospital. That's true in the ASPs as well. And we're seeing continued growth in the ASP, where our Stryker offense is really winning at a pretty spectacular rates as it relates to new builds and big renovations. So we have a lot of momentum across all of those dimensions, which translates to terrific performance as you saw with hips and knees. But the other part of our story is trauma extremities. So the right medical acquisition has been a complete home run of a deal. And you\u2019re seeing that not only has it been great for our extremities business, but it enabled us to focus a lot more on our core trauma business. And we really had all of our businesses in trauma extremities humming as we exited the year. And some great product launches towards the end of the year and some more to come in 2024. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. And then maybe turning to medical because it is now, I think the biggest unit inside the company and the comps are increasingly tougher in the first half of this year. It\u2019s been exemplary growth through late 2022, and then in the first half 2023, inside of that, you talked about Vocera continuing to be a double-digit grower, but if you can level set us on the entire portfolio, how you think about the ability of that business to continue to be accretive to overall growth and maybe what the appropriate expectations are around the medical segment given how much is in that segment. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, we love our medical business. And frankly, it\u2019s become a big and very fast growing business. We continue to expect it to grow above Stryker\u2019s average growth rate. That is going to be true for the next five years. From quarter-to-quarter, it does bounce around a little bit because, of course, there\u2019s capital, a lot of large capital within medical. But you also have increasingly more stable revenue with Sage, which is doing spectacularly well. Then you\u2019ve got, obviously, the AED demand, which has exploded. And we have a terrific AED business, tremendous innovation, we launched the Xpedition stair chair in the early part of the year, the first powered stair chair, which the firehouses absolutely love. And then you\u2019ve got a lot of new demand for the wireless connection, wireless stretchers. So just tremendous innovation, tremendous leadership position, and now a much more diverse set of businesses than we had historically. So I think medical is the business. And Stryker that\u2019s the most underestimated because AEDs are high growth, our powered cots are high growth, and now our bed business is doing really well behind ProCuity. And then you have Vocera in addition to that. So really, I would expect high growth from all of those different businesses. Sage, Vocera, beds, stretchers, AEDs because of innovation that we\u2019re constantly innovating. And we have a couple of big launches in medical coming this year as well. So it\u2019s an exciting time to be at medical. And we also have an outstanding leadership team. They\u2019ve really focused on talent for years and years and years. And so I\u2019m very bullish on medical. And I think again, whatever people have in their models, we\u2019ve tended to beat medical and people back for the last six years. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening, and thank you for taking the questions and very nice end to the year. I\u2019m curious about where you are in your super cycle, and not to use sports analogy, but are you halfway through halftime or you have a couple more innings to go? I know I\u2019m mixing. My metaphors there and also sort of similarly AAOS, what should we be expecting for that? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part and then Jason can talk about AAOS. Look, that, that I would say that our pipeline of innovation is incredibly strong. When I mentioned the term super cycle, that really was referring to, let\u2019s call them big platform launches. But the reality is we\u2019re driving tremendous growth even in some of the divisions that don\u2019t have big platform growth launches, if you think about upper extremities, if you think about foot and ankle, but I would say the big ones coming up, we have this Pangea launch within our core trauma business, which is a big platform launch. Q: So those are the ones I\u2019d point out too. But I \u2013 what I tell you is every business has launches planned and some of them, you accumulate a number of small launches and you end up driving pretty terrific growth. But I would say maybe we\u2019re kind of midway through the large platforms. But I would tell you everyone\u2019s reloading. So we launched 1788 and they\u2019re reloading and already working on 1888. M&A : Jason Beach : Yes, Joanne, it\u2019s Jason. Happy to follow-up after the call as well. But AAOS will be exciting. Some of the products that Kevin just referred to we will be demoing at AAOS starting with Blueprint, followed by Pangea, 1788 camera will also be demoed as well, so it\u2019ll be action packed. So we\u2019ll plan on seeing you out there. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, congrats on a really strong print here. I had two questions, maybe first one on the guidance here. 7.5% to 9% for the fiscal 2024. What is being assumed for China VBP? Any backlog contribution? And I\u2019m looking at Q1 that\u2019s the toughest comp of the year. Should Q1 still be within that annual guidance range of 7.5% to 9%? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Hi, Vijay. As we look at \u2013 I don\u2019t want to guide quarterly, but I would tell you that the cadence of what we\u2019re going to deliver from the mid-point will play out similar to 2023. But keep in mind, you got to back out one selling day in Q1 is what I would say and then on VBP, I\u2019ll let Jason. Jason Beach : Yes, Vijay. It\u2019s Jason. On VBP, I think we don\u2019t disclose in terms of the impact there. So we won\u2019t. But in terms of a follow-up to your capital question, as we think about the capital environment, really the tone has not changed there. We feel really good. Orders are very healthy. I mentioned that we came into the year with an elevated level, so we feel good. And just as a reminder, right, if you think about our capital sales, so our smaller capital being, call it 15% of our sales needs to continue to be refreshed as you think about kind of the procedural volume and then large capital being 10% of our sales, again very healthy from both an order and backlog perspective. So we feel good about that in 2024. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Kevin, maybe one for you on that. I saw you mentioned direct-to-consumer campaign on MAKO is very successful. Could you just elaborate on that? And I\u2019m curious, do you think, like, on the Spine side, we could perhaps see adoption rates similar to knee, where 50%, 60% of Spine procedures could be done in MAKO at some point in the future? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Well, first, the direct-to-consumer has been terrific. I mean, obviously, we have such a lead in robotics as a surgery. We want to make sure that we\u2019re differentiating our product among the rest of products and the searches and the impressions that we have exceeded our expectations. We\u2019re really pleased we\u2019re going to continue that program for a good portion of this year. And so that\u2019s certainly helped create a tremendous interest among consumers as well as hospitals, who actually watch the same ads as consumers. So we\u2019re very excited about that. Spine, we couldn\u2019t be more happy, because certainly that\u2019s been a gap in our portfolio relative to others. And this has got terrific workflow. And look, I think robotic adoption tends to really grow. No matter what procedure you\u2019re doing, if you have a good solution, it will over time become the majority and eventually standard of care. And we\u2019ve obviously seen this in the general surgery world as it relates to prostate and starting to happen in other cases. And I think it\u2019s going to happen in orthopedics. So Spine might take a little longer, but I absolutely do believe it\u2019s going to be key for us in the future. We\u2019re extremely excited. We\u2019ve been showing surgeons the MAKO spine getting terrific feedback on the workflow and the speed and the efficiency. And again, that\u2019s within the same ecosystem as the Q Guidance. So we\u2019ve been selling a lot of Q Guidance software, which is used to navigate those procedures. And that same camera, which is the fastest camera on the market, will be compatible with MAKO when we launch it. So I do believe it\u2019ll become for pedicle screw placement, at least the vast majority of the procedures in the future. Operator : Our next question will come from Shagun Singh with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Great, thank you so much. Kevin, I was hoping to get your thoughts on utilization, it\u2019s been a key topic this last week across some healthcare sectors. What trends are you seeing in healthcare utilization across different care settings? What is driving it and how do you think about the sustainability of it? Is it being driven by the aging demographics? Is it innovation? Is it just low market penetration? And I think you did indicate that there is still a backlog and it is contributing, but is it a meaningful contributor to growth on a year-over-year basis? And then I have a follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Well, I think if you look at the hospitals and what they\u2019re saying, that\u2019s kind of one of the indicators we look at. They\u2019re busy, right? The hospitals are busy, patients, definitely aging demographics plays for Stryker\u2019s portfolio that definitely plays to our advantage. And every day, 10,000 more people are turning 65. The activity levels are also increasing, right. The advent of Pickleball has been a terrific thing for our business. More active people who are elderly tend to want to stay active. And activity levels are kind of the biggest predictor of needing joint replacements and sports medicine procedures. So we\u2019re seeing very good activity levels. And so I don\u2019t really want to talk about backlog. I just think what we\u2019re seeing is patients presenting, frankly, some patients who are just wanting to be more active, losing weight and then wanting to be more active and then being eligible for surgery. So we do see really good waiting lists for surgeries for surgeons in the orthopedic space, hospitals ordering capital, whether it\u2019s small capital or large capital, building more ASCs. The ASC trend has actually really helped, because patients love it. They go, they get home the same day, they have a terrific experience, and they tell all their friends, and that word of mouth is spreading for hip and knees, absolutely, for hip and knee surgeries that is happening. And our percent of procedures in ASCs continues to climb. So I think those are the \u2013 there\u2019s a number of factors I just outlined, all of them pointing to, at least for this year, continued good demand. And I don\u2019t know how temporary it is. This could be continuing, frankly, for a period of time, because I think demographics and activity levels are the two drivers that we\u2019re seeing, at least for our portfolio of businesses. Shagun Singh : That\u2019s really helpful. And then just on guidance, you guys delivered or you put up a pretty strong initial guide out of the gates. Does it give you room for upside as you move through the year? And I guess, more specifically, what areas could we potentially look to drive that upside? Thank you for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Great question. First of all, we have a history that we generally like to follow, and I would tell you that it\u2019s early days. We\u2019re here in January looking at 2024, we feel very confident about where we\u2019re going to perform on sales and driving off margin expansion. At this point, I\u2019m not going to comment on the potential to go beyond that, but we feel very good about the guidance that we put out. Operator : Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions and congrats on an amazing year. On the gross margins, can you help bridge the third quarter to fourth quarter gross margins? How much of the impact was mixed? And then you have the good guys and bad guys that can help us understand that sequential change? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Sure, Pito. Without going into too much detail, I would say, the single biggest item was really mix in terms of what was growing much faster in Q4 versus Q3 relative to sort of some of the other items. We also had really solid price performance in Q4, which contributed to that. And then lastly, sort of in typical Stryker fashion, we hit a little bit of a hockey stick here in Q4, too. And so that actually benefits up the gross margin line. Pito Chickering : Great. And then on pricing, back in third quarter, I think it was about 30 basis points favorable, it\u2019s 70 basis points favorable this quarter. Guidance assumes flat pricing for 2024. I guess, shouldn\u2019t there be some positive pricing in 2024 just as the fourth quarter comes out? And after you gotten accelerating pricing throughout the year, I guess, why should 2024 pricing flatten out? Thanks so much. Glenn Boehnlein : Keep in mind, flat is the average for the whole company. And the way that that pricing guide is calculated, it\u2019s legacy product over legacy product. So a lot of our pricing increases carry over into 2024. They\u2019re just comparing to the new higher price. I would also say, too, flat is the average of some up and some down. And so we absolutely will see price increases across some of our businesses. And that will be balanced with some of the challenges we have in, say, Spine or some of our other orthopedic businesses. So I do think we haven\u2019t backed off our pricing strategy one bit, and we fully expect to sort of maximize the benefit we\u2019re going to get out of pricing. Operator : Our next question will come from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question, Glenn. Maybe just a finer point on some of the op margin guide. It looks like the 200 basis points, more than half of that\u2019s in 2024. Can you just confirm that there\u2019s a little bit of kind of math going around? Just want to make sure we got the math in 2024 correct. And with such a big ramp in 2024 on the guidance, just can you give a little more confidence on what you\u2019re doing to kind of achieve that 100 basis points plus in 2024? What you\u2019re seeing on the cost input side, just to kind of drive confidence that that\u2019s achievable in 2024? Kevin Lobo : Sure. Yes. I think you can do the math as well as I can, especially given all the areas that I\u2019ve guided in the full year. So I definitely think you\u2019re in the zip code for what we think will happen in 2024. And honestly, if we look at sort of what we\u2019ve laid out and planned for the year, first of all, the natural leverage we get from growth versus fixed cost in operating expenses certainly will provide us some benefits. We also won\u2019t stand still in a lot of the gross margin initiatives that I mentioned, and those will move forward and also provide some benefit that we\u2019ll see in 2024. And so I would tell you that we haven\u2019t walked lightly on this. I would say that across the globe, Stryker is very focused on these op margin expansion projects and sustainable op margin expansion for 2024 and 2025. And so we feel very confident that we\u2019ll be able to deliver that. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks. And then maybe one quick question on MAKO shoulder just to make sure that\u2019s still expected to come in 2024 and anything else you want to say on that at this point. Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, as we\u2019ve said from the beginning, MAKO shoulder will launch at the end of 2024. So I don\u2019t expect to have much at all of a revenue impact. That said, it\u2019s not like our shoulder business needs MAKO shoulder to be growing at strong double digits. They have terrific products within upper extremities with shoulder ID with a number of really pyrocarbon humeral. We have a fracture stem for Perform, which is incredible, a Reverse Perform stemless. So they have four terrific launches with an upper extremity. So they\u2019re going to do fine even before MAKO. But MAKO will be the end of the year. The feedback from searches have been terrific. But that\u2019ll have much more of an impact in 2025, not so much in 2024. Operator : Our next question will come from Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on MAKO, this question might be for Jason. Just the domestic number this quarter was a little bit soft, and we\u2019re hearing about one of your competitors just giving their system away because it\u2019s not all that great. Can you talk about the dynamics that you\u2019re seeing in the market, especially domestically for MAKO in terms of placing systems, selling systems, and then just having to get really aggressive on the pricing side, just given the environment that you\u2019re in? And then conversely, the OUS number looks phenomenal again. Just where are we at in terms of growing that business over the next several years? And I do have one follow-up. Jason Beach : Yes, I\u2019ll start this and Kevin, feel free obviously to weigh in. But as we think about the MAKO offense, and I think we\u2019ve said this previously as well. When we think about the various options to bring MAKO to market, we\u2019ve been flexible, right, whether it\u2019s leasing, rentals, et cetera. So I think we\u2019re very competitive from that standpoint. And to your comment on kind of where we are, I would still say whether it\u2019s U.S. or internationally, early innings here, we\u2019ve got a lot of runway relative to MAKO. But as we think about the financing options, it\u2019s not going to be an impediment for us to expand the MAKO footprint. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The only thing I would add to Jason\u2019s comments are every ASC MAKO that\u2019s installed is financed everyone, and that\u2019s becoming a bigger percentage of the MAKO installation. So what you\u2019re seeing is more financed rentals and financed versus outright capital purchases. So that obviously the revenue number and the revenue growth of 3 percentage or less is not the installation growth. The installation growth is higher than what you\u2019re seeing. And over time that\u2019ll start to normalize and then you\u2019ll start to see the growth rate be more reflective of the installation rate. But we\u2019re going through this kind of transition phase right now, and we are giving them away. So we charge for it and we have different pricing models, obviously, and we want the customers to have skin in the game, so that if we just give it away, they have no incentive to use it. And what we don\u2019t want are a bunch of robots collecting dust. So we care a lot and we monitor utilization of the robots very, very significantly. And then, of course, OUS we\u2019re seeing terrific pickup and a lot more purchases than finance. We do offer financing around the world, but so far in international we\u2019re seeing a lot more purchases than we are financing, which is why you see the revenue spike. But again, international has a huge potential. It\u2019s kind of where we were in the U.S. about five years ago. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Understood. Thanks for that. And then sticking with MAKO, Kevin, you mentioned, shoulder, you don\u2019t really need the application as much because you\u2019re crushing it on the shoulder side. But in spine, you\u2019re doing better the last couple of quarters. I haven\u2019t really heard why that is. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just some of the dislocation or not. But I think it\u2019s probably a bigger opportunity on the spine side of the business going forward. These centers that already have MAKO and use it for hips and knees, can you quickly transfer the system to the spine part of those institutions or facilities and start to pick up share fairly quickly? Or is this something that\u2019s going to take many, many quarters? We\u2019re talking 2025, 2026 before it really starts to impact the spine business. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. What I\u2019d say is, first of all, the MAKO brand is extremely well known. That\u2019s a very, very big positive. And I think what you\u2019re going to see is a much faster uptake than you would have seen had we not had already had MAKO on hips and knees. Will it take a little bit of time? Sure. Will a spine surgeon want to share the robot with hips and knee surgeons? Not sure yet. Obviously, that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to see play out, whether they\u2019re going to want their own robot or they\u2019re going to be willing to operate on the days that the hip and knee people aren\u2019t operating. So that\u2019s a whole dynamic. I think that\u2019ll vary account by account. So we\u2019re already working on our commercialization plans. I think part of the reason for our success is \u2013 success with the Q guidance, which is one half of the system. So you\u2019re going to have the Q guidance and then as well, MAKO, they know it\u2019s coming now. Customers have gone to Leesburg, Virginia, our spine headquarters, to see MAKO spine. And many of them have stopped their purchases of other robots knowing that this is coming. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s helping to contribute to our, let\u2019s call it somewhat improved performance, but we still would like to grow at a higher rate than we are right now. And we know we need not just MAKO, but also the CO-PILOT product. So we\u2019re going to go from being behind to being ahead. And CO-PILOT should launch in a similar time frame slightly ahead of MAKO spine. So you\u2019re now going to have the CO-PILOT product plus MAKO spine, where our competitors will just have their robot. The ones that have robot will just have a robot without CO-PILOT with haptic feedback that can do the laminectomy and discectomy portions of the procedure, which complements the pedicle screw placement. So we\u2019re really going to be in a great position by the time third quarter comes around. Robots do take time, so the scaling will take time, but I think it\u2019ll be certainly much faster than the initial people who came in with robotics, they know, they benefit from it, and they know and they can trust the MAKO brand. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to, hopefully, Kevin, ask about just got a temperature check on the health care delivery systems capacity for orthopedic procedure growth. I think heading in to 2023 after experiencing 2022, there were concerns around staffing shortages, et cetera, and potentially be creating a bottleneck for procedure volume growth. That clearly didn\u2019t play out in 2023. It doesn\u2019t sound like from your comments, it\u2019s going to play out. You expect it to play out in 2024. But are there any capacity constraint issues in the U.S. health care delivery system for orthopedic procedure volume growth as we go forward in 2024 and 2025 or is that fully in the rearview mirror? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I think it\u2019s largely in the rearview mirror. There\u2019s still niggling things here and there, but it\u2019s gotten very quiet. You saw that in Q4. It\u2019s just a boomer of a Q4. And kind of the normal seasonality, I think we now have finally a normalized year for you to compare is, of course, adjusted for selling days, but there is a normalized year finally. And yes, they\u2019ve gotten their staffing issues solved largely, and they do prioritize orthopedics, because orthopedics is a moneymaker for hospitals, right? Cardiovascular and orthopedic procedures are two money makers. And so if they are short staffed, they are going to prioritize staffing for orthopedics. I would say the only area that still has a lot of room to run is ASCs. So every hospital is constructing ASCs, and that\u2019s going to continue to be an engine of future growth. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a very normalized environment. They have the capacity. They can operate additional days, which we saw some of that in Q4 again, which we hadn\u2019t seen for a couple of years. So, I think the hospitals are absolutely ready now, and a lot of that\u2019s behind us. Josh Jennings : Excellent. Just one follow-up on MAKO. Just with the record system placement quarter. Was hoping to just get some details on where \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing in terms of second or even third system purchases by hospitals, hospital systems, any kind of percentage of total systems or \u2013 or how big of an opportunity do you see kind of getting that second, third, maybe even fourth system into hospitals? Thanks for taking the questions. Jason Beach : Hey Josh, it\u2019s Jason. First, I would say there are many hospital systems across the U.S. that are second, third system. For competitive reasons, we don\u2019t disclose kind of number of units installed. But you certainly see numerous systems with multiple MAKOs. I think as you fast forward to a shoulder and spine application, you\u2019re going to see more and more of that when you think about utilization and the need for future systems. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about that. Kevin Lobo : Yes, frankly, I would say it\u2019s rare to have one MAKO in a hospital now. There are some that have five, six, seven MAKOs. I think 60% of our knees are going to MAKOs. There\u2019s got to be a lot of MAKOs to be able to drive that kind of volume. So the days of people saying, well, this is my first MAKO, those days in the U.S. are kind of fading. That phenomenon still exists outside the U.S. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Just quickly on the SERF acquisition. Are there any particular portfolio gaps you closed with that deal? Or is it more about expanding your distribution footprint internationally? Jason Beach : Yes, Chris, it\u2019s Jason. And we\u2019ll talk about this more after the close. But it really is \u2013 it helps from a hip portfolio perspective. But beyond that, we haven\u2019t said much at this point. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re set to close this quarter, and then we\u2019ll certainly talk more to that. Chris Pasquale : Okay. And then I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about the outlook for neurovascular in 2024. 2023 was a better year for that segment in the U.S., but it kind of got offset by international. And along with Spine, it was really one of only two segments not to grow high single digits or better. So what\u2019s the game plan to drive better growth in that business? And do you have what you need internally? Or do you need to look for supplements to that? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, we continue to like the neuromuscular market, as there\u2019s still a large number of patients that are being treated. It\u2019s an attractive market growing high single digits. And we do expect to grow in line, at least in line with the market. We are obviously very hard hit by China this year with the VBP. We had a very big neurovascular business in China. So that hurt. I don\u2019t know that we completely lapped it, but it\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of China pretty soon, and then that will be behind us. We also have the Cerus acquisition, which is off to a very good start outside the United States. We are seeking U.S. approval, I believe. That will be some time in 2025, maybe beginning of 2026. So we still have a bit of time to wait for that, but that is a fabulous product for intrasecular technology. We are looking at an area like liquid embolic. We don\u2019t have that product, as you want to think about one that we we\u2019re going to be looking into. Every business has something they\u2019d like to add. But we do have a good pipeline. We don\u2019t talk about neurovascular pipeline too much because they get subject to regulatory approval through the PMA process. So \u2013 but the team does have some very good products that are lining up. And I do believe we\u2019re going to be back to kind of much closer market growth, slightly above market growth in the years ahead. But as the market we continue to like, it obviously has gotten much more competitive on the ischemic side, and we continue to have a very strong business on the hemorrhagic side. We launched a couple of products last year, the Vector 46 catheter, the Tetra [ph] coil and that kind of fueled some very good U.S. growth as you saw in the back half of the year. So we like the business. Yes, it\u2019s not as fast growing as it was historically, but it\u2019s still a very good business. We\u2019re committed to it and do expect that that will pick up as we put VBP in the rearview mirror. Chris Pasquale : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I\u2019ll echo everyone\u2019s congrats on a really strong end of the year and a strong start to 2024. Just a quick question on the orthopedics market in general. One of the things I\u2019ve been trying to get a handle on is what\u2019s really happening in underlying market growth. Obviously, 2023 benefited from some semblance of a backlog work down. But it seems like yourselves and your competitors \u2013 not that you have guided specifically for Ortho, but seem to be signaling higher than sort of normal, call it, pre-COVID market growth. And I\u2019m curious, beyond pricing, what\u2019s really changed here? Has capacity increased? We talked about ASCs. What\u2019s changed fundamentally in the orthopedic \u2013 large joint orthopedics market that might be driving higher \u2013 sustainably higher growth versus pre-COVID levels? Jason Beach : Danielle, it\u2019s Jason. I think a couple of things, right? And Kevin even alluded to this, I think, earlier as well. But I think there\u2019s a variety of things around demographics. Kevin touched on activity levels. Certainly, that plays a part here. We talked about a more favorable pricing environment. Certainly, it plays a role. And then if you think just from an adoption standpoint with robotic-assisted surgery, I think there\u2019s a variety of dynamics at play here that have come into play in terms of elevated market levels. And if you saw what we published coming out of Investor Day, we\u2019ve said over the next two years to three years, we expect this to be in kind of that mid-single-digit range. So we're certainly confident in 2024 and beyond as we think about the ortho markets. Danielle Antalffy : And I guess just to follow up on that, how much of that is Stryker specific though, because given the innovation on Stryker side, the success of MAKO and pull through there? How much is market broadly versus Stryker specific if you can even remotely quantify that? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Look, we've always talked about outgrowing the market, let's call it around numbers, 300 basis points ahead of the market. And in the past, there was time when hips weren't quite growing that fast until we launched Insignia stem. But if you go back over the last decade, we have been growing roughly 300 basis points faster than market. So if the market moves up, then our numbers move up as well. And I think you've seen that all year, this year, as you've seen in the last couple of years. So that's kind of the way I'd look at it is whatever the market grows, we should be roughly 300 basis points faster because we have this huge lead in robotic-assisted surgery, as well as cementless, and we just have a team that's firing on all cylinders. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt Miksic : Hey, everybody. Thanks so much. So maybe a couple of follow-ups, some of the things that have come up. But I'd love to try to get some additional color on M&A. You talked about sort of being back on OpEx, which is awesome. And just maybe if you could talk a little bit about what that means, large versus small, sort of new platform versus maybe something that strengthens one of your existing businesses, like, I don't know, neurotech or ENT or neuromod has come up in the past or anything you could talk about that would be great. And then I have one follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Hey, Matt. Look, I can't get too specific with you, the nature of M&A. M&A is fluid and the deals have to make sense financially. You have to have the buyer that's ready to sell when you want to acquire. I think because of the pent-up demand in the businesses, we have a lot of mouths to feed and they're hungry. And so I would think in, let's say, at least the first half of the year, it'll probably be more of tucking things in that because we've been staying close to these companies and we have a bunch of deals that are teed up. But then once you get through the first half of the year, I think it becomes open field. And then open field means maybe more tuck ins, but it means maybe more things that are in the adjacency categories. We're always open to those, but a lot of things have to, stars have to align in order to be able to do those deals. But we're back on the normal Stryker offense. And again, what does that mean? It means most of the deals by number are going to be those tuck-in deals, but things like Vocera and neurovascular and those types of Physio-Control, those kinds of deals are going to pop up that are more in the adjacent categories. But I can't predict this honestly, because I don't know what's going to happen. But we are out hunting and we are excited to get back to a more regular M&A. It's been a huge part of our offense. We know how to do this. We've gotten really good acumen around evaluations and around integrations, which early in my tenure, we weren't so good at integrations. And if I look at Wright Medical, it's just been a role model for how to integrate a complex business, and the results have been stellar [ph]. Matt Miksic : That's great. Thank you for that. And then just follow-up on ASCs. It's always been a sort of hot topic, I guess, in the last few years, particularly coming out of the pandemic. So just maybe some thoughts, if you could, on where you are in terms of the build out of that opportunity. Maybe where like the percentage of hips and knees that are now you think being done through that channel and then sort of back to the M&A side of it. Is there other businesses that have some synergy there? You've obviously done well with equipment and with MAKO, with your OR equipment and implant pull through for these ASCs. But anything else makes sense to kind of bridge and lever that success you've had there? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks, Matt. Okay. I could spend a long time on this, but I'll just sort of cut to the chase and say that, look, things are continuing to progress in the ASC. We're now running between 12% to 15% of our hips and knees in the ASC. That's higher, certainly, than it was last year. So it continues to climb at a gradual rate because the rate limiting factor is capacity and the buildouts of these ASCs, but it is definitely continuing a steady climb. We have everything we need for orthopedic ASCs, and when I say everything, I mean booms, lights, power tools, Steri-Shield, Neptune waste management, operating table, every implant from foot and ankle to shoulder to hips to knees to spine. And I'm going to include spine in that because we just most recently did a really terrific ASC deal in spine. A lot of spine procedures are moving to the ASC. We did this in Duluth, Minnesota, which is a really exciting deal. And we were able to leverage spine in addition to a lot of other capital equipment in the ASC. And so those new builds and big renovations, we are absolutely beautifully positioned. What we're now looking at, now that we're a little bit in the GI space with Neptune and the POM acquisition that we have is, what else can we do in that space and other things we could add in that space. Now, I'm not saying that's specifically about ASC. It's about how we are. We like to be really busy in a call point, and now that we're in the GI call point, what every call point we go into, we say, what else can we bring to that call point? What other value can we bring? I'm not predicting that we'll do something in that space, but that's kind of how we look at it. But as it relates to the orthopedic ASC, we are in an incredibly good position to be able to win in the ASC market. Operator : Our next question will come from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Caitlin Cronin : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a great quarter. Just jumping up on Matt's question earlier. Momentum in spine really seems to be strong. Do you have any more clarity on how much you've been able to capitalize on the disruption in the space or expect to kind of capitalize from the disruption? Kevin Lobo : Yes, I tell you. Listen, our performance thus far has really nothing to do with the disruption of the consolidation. It's just starting. We've just started to hear some disruption in Texas as an example and a couple of other little spots. So I would say very early days of disruption, and that's not the reason why we're doing better. We've kind of really improved our offense in spine, especially as it relates to enabling tech. I think the Q guidance was a big shot in the arm for the spine business. They've done a terrific job selling that and, of course, leveraging that for implants. That's been more of a factor than disruption. I think we're going to see the disruption starting this year, and hopefully we'll be able to pick up on that. But thus far, there really hasn't been much in the way of disruption, and we're going to see that play out over the course of this year. Caitlin Cronin : Got it. And then just a quick one on MAKO shoulder. You noted great feedback from docs. What's kind of going to be the use case for the docs? Is it going to be outcomes, time saving, et cetera? Kevin Lobo : Yes, just \u2013 look, there's a whole series of outcomes, just to simplify it, it makes a very hard procedure very easy to do. That's the way I would simplify it. Why was the partial knee so wildly successful? It was a hard procedure to do and the robot made it easy. And the shoulder is harder to do than a partial knee, and it's going to make a very hard procedure very easy to do. Take stress off the surgeon, have very predictable results. That's been the value profit. There are surgeons I talk to you now that due to high volume of knees that tell me at the end of the day, I'm not tired anymore. This robot is taking away my stress. It's just making life easier for me, and you can multiply that by 10 for shoulder replacements. Operator : Our next question will come from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Good evening, guys. First on price, how are you thinking about the relative pricing outlook in 2024 as you look at the major segments of MedSurg, Neuro versus Ortho, Spine, anything meaningfully different than what we saw in 2023 directionally? And I know we touched on this at Investor Day, but what gives you the confidence in the sustainability of this firmer pricing environment? And then I have a quick follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. It's Glenn. So as we look at price, first of all we've really honed in a strategy and a group that solely focuses on pricing for the whole company. If we think about sort of the segments, I don't think you'll see a lot of different performance in what we see out of our segments in general. MedSurg and Neurotech has more of an ability to gain pricing and we see price increases in those businesses. And honestly, even before the pandemic, we would see price increases coming out of the MedSurg businesses. I would say on the Ortho side, the trend has really been that it's just been less negative. Also, if you think about those ortho contracts, they're generally three-year contracts. So we haven't really been cycled through all those contracts yet. We have real discussions around inflation in our business with our customers. They know it, their experience it themselves. And so we're just \u2013 I'm not expecting to see positive come out of the ortho side, but we'll probably continue to see less negative. Steven Lichtman : Got it. And then Glenn, just on Pillar 2, is there an impact in 2024 that you're offsetting? And how are you thinking about sort of the potential impact in 2025 based on what you know today? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. No, good question. As we think about 2024, there is an impact for us. I think that through our tax planning and other strategies, we feel like we have fully offset that impact, and that's included in our effective tax rate guidance. For 2025, it's just \u2013 it's too early to comment at this point, to be honest. It's something we're just starting to look at, and we'll have more on that probably a year from now. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company, Inc. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Matson : Yes. Thanks. It sounds like you're looking at doing some more M&A here. I was just curious if you could remind us where your leverage ratio is? And if you have a target at the \u2013 how high you'd be willing to go there? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. We generally tried to maintain a leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3. And I think we do the calc on 2023 where we're sitting at year-end, we're squarely on the lower end of that range. So we do feel like there is some room, if needed depending on sort of what we see in the acquisition landscape. But I fully expect that sort of given the normal cadence of acquisitions and that product tuck-ins are generally what we sort of normally go after. We likely won't be out borrowing to do those types of acquisitions. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And so keep in mind that 3 is not necessarily an upper limit, right? So that's a normal landing zone for us, this 2.5 to 3 for the right deal at the right price. Could we go higher than 3? Sure, we would. And we have obviously have to commit to paying down the debt. But we don't really look at us as sort of being constrained that way. So for the right asset, if it's going to be value-creating for Stryker, we are not afraid to push beyond the 3, but that's kind of the land we like to live in as a landing zone. Mike Matson : Yes, I understand. And then just wanted to ask one about Sports Medicine, I didn't really hear much there. Do you feel like that business is kind of where you want it in terms of the product offering and the scale? Kevin Lobo : I am so glad you asked about sports. It's absolutely a rocket ship of growth for us for the past five, six, seven years. They have a number of shoulder launches coming out this year, I believe, four different shoulder launches. They call it internally this shoulder [indiscernible], which is quite motivating. But we've done a terrific job with hip. We've had a terrific job with knee, but shoulder has been kind of the area that we've needed to have new products. But they've been just an amazing business. It was a startup 12 years ago, and it just become a big, fast-growing business. It's really helped us win ASC deals. Frankly, having a really every ASC deal is orthopedic, ASC deal involves sports, and because we have such a strong portfolio we are able to win those deals. But historically, we wouldn't have been able to, and it's an incredibly exciting year of new product launches, particularly in shoulder. And I think some of those hopefully might be shown in AAOS, I'll have to get back to you on that. But I'm very bullish. We have a fabulous leader who's been leading the sports medicine business since the start-up when we had just a camera and not really much in the way of implants. And we are now formidable in sport medicine. Certainly in the U.S., certainly in Europe, we still have work to do in the emerging markets in Asia Pacific, but really a fabulous business. And it's been part of the growth engine within Endoscopy. And you've seen Endoscopy post pretty impressive results, certainly last year and this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Drew Ranieri : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll put both of mine together. But Kevin, you were so early on in the orthopedic robotics landscape just with soft tissue robotics. What are your kind of your current thoughts on supporting that ecosystem today versus entering soft tissue robotics? Is it something that's concerning you? Or just how are you thinking about that opportunity? And then second, just could you talk about the PROstep launch from earlier in the fourth quarter or late third quarter? Just any metrics you can kind of share there on the foot business? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. So as it relates to soft tissue robotics, listen, it's a very interesting space. As you know, there's a very large and very successful company that kind of dominates the space. We certainly don't have a problem selling Endoscopy, if you look at our numbers. Certainly, for our 1788 and our cameras we're doing extremely well. We still have huge room for growth outside of being in soft tissue robotics. It's an area that we're certainly interested in, but very respectful of the large incumbent. And I'm not sure that we'd want to try to take them head on, just like anybody trying to come and take us head on in our space wouldn't be so easy. But it is an area that we like, there are loads and loads of companies, start-ups in the space, and we're looking at them. And it's not inconceivable that we would make a move at some point. But again, not expecting to come out and launch something that would go head-to-head with the Goliath and try to take them down. So, but it is a space we're pursuing, we're interested. We're looking at companies, and it's not impossible that we would make a move at some point in the future. It's just not an easy space. As you know, robots are hard. And we're going to be very thoughtful and very careful. But we don't see this kind of \u2013 at this point anyways, as a major threat to our Endoscopy business at all. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about the sprint of margins here and ask you, you do produce some upside on the top line and the margins over the course of this year and next year. How do you think about delivering that to the bottom line versus reinvesting in above that goal to get back to your pre-COVID margins? Kevin Lobo : I mean, first of all, it's heavily dependent on sort of the mix that we get if we over deliver on sales in terms of how much margin we can get to. I would say that 200 basis points expansion is the absolute goal, and that will be the target. And we get there a little sooner, so be it. But we won't take our \u2013 our eye off of making sure that we're doing what's right in the business so that we can deliver that 200 basis points. Matt Taylor : And that \u2013 I wanted to ask another one on Vocera. You talked a lot about it on this call, and it's obviously doing well. Can you talk a little bit about how that's expanding its tentacles kind of throughout your organization? And anything else we should expect from it in the future as it connects some of the different technologies and provide you some cross-selling opportunities? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Great. Listen, I \u2013 integrations are challenging. In this one, we had some challenges with the cloud. We had to restructure the sales force. We are already seeing terrific integration with both beds and now more recently with our wireless stretcher. We had \u2013 they had a list before we bought the company, and we've expanded that list of connecting products and those products that we're going to connect to the ecosystem are not just Stryker products. So there are third-party companies that are coming to us and asking to be connected to our ecosystem. So we want to be a vital resource within hospitals. We're even looking at emergency departments that don't have really well automated workflow that actually do the documentation that take cognitive load off of nurses. So the potential every day, it just keeps expanding and expanding it. So it's wildly exciting. And the team now \u2013 the new sales team is really, really pick up in a big way. And so we're super excited. We're not ready \u2013 ready to talk about which products we'll be integrating. We'd rather do the integration and tell you about it. And we'd like to sort of give you a full year update. So a year from now, I expect we'll give you kind of a wholesome update and include more of those products that will be attached to the ecosystem. But we are really, really excited about this acquisition. It's a platform. So I'd say after MAKO, this is the second platform acquisition that I've done during my tenure. The other deals we've done, none of them were platforms. And that means it has wild upside potential over time. Now it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time. But this is \u2013 for us is \u2013 it will be very sticky in hospitals. It will just be a renewal, recurring revenue. And then as you add more and more to the ecosystem; it becomes something that hospitals can't live without. So that's our dream, and we're pretty optimistic given where we are right now, given the momentum that we have, given the interest that we have, both from parts of Stryker as well as third-party companies wanting to integrate to the system. Matt Taylor : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Our final question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'll just ask one here, and by the way, congrats again on a fantastic quarter, solid end to the year. So just clearly, you guys \u2013 since your Analyst Day, in particular, have been conveying how committed you are to margin expansion. You're kind of putting a stake in the ground, really strong guidance here for 2024. I guess I'm just going to ask, how should we think about that margin guidance relative to the potential and willingness to take on margin dilution as you get more aggressive on the M&A front? Should we think of that as something that already had contemplated the potential to need to absorb some dilution? Is there \u2013 are you more focused on top line accretion and more sensitive to kind of margin accretion faster than historically? I would just love your thoughts there and how we should think about kind of this margin trajectory and sprinting back to pre-COVID with respect to deals and how that will fit in the P&L. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Rich. Thanks for the question. Look, I think back to 2017, 2018, 2019, we were expanding margins before some dilution. We have around 80 basis points. And we were not growing at this kind of growth rate, right? We were growing in the 6s and 7s organically, not double-digit growth organically or high single-digit growth organically. So with that higher growth, this is not a crazy level of margin expansion that we think we could do. But doing small deals. And if they're small tuck-in varieties, there's some dilution that will come with that. We expect we're going to eat that and be able to deliver the 200 basis points. If a deal came along, let's say, something like a MAKO, which, as you know, occurs once a decade, maybe. It's not an everyday occurrence. That had dilution, but we felt it was just so great for the company that we had to do it. We would go ahead and do it. And then we would look at our numbers and say, is this something we can absorb or isn't it? Our going-in assumption is that that's not a likely occurrence. It's not impossible though. And I never want to rule anything out when it comes to M&A. If something really delicious appears and we think that this is going to be great for our future, we're going to go ahead and do it, and then we'll do our math and figure out can we get there with the 200 basis points. But in the normal cadence of operations of Stryker \u2013 and that means doing a number of deals that have a little bit of dilution here or there \u2013 we're going to eat it and we'll deliver our 200 basis points. If something bigger happens like a MAKO, as you know, was very dilutive but has proven to be a pretty terrific asset for our company, we're not going to say, well, we're going to wait two years and then we'll do it later. We're going to go ahead and do it. But again, I don't see that on the horizon. It's not obvious to me. But I'd never want to rule that out. It would be foolish, frankly, to be beholden to a certain financial target and pass up what could be very value creating for our company. But again, it's not our current frame of mind, not our current thought process. But I don't want to rule out that that could be a possibility. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have terrific momentum as we finish the year. We're excited about 2024, and we look forward to sharing our first quarter results with you in April. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I'm your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter as well as some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. In the first quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 10% with double-digit growth in MedSurg and Neurotechnology and high single-digit growth in Orthopaedics and Spine despite one less selling day and tough comparables from a year ago. This reflects our team's continued strong commercial execution. Our results were led by very strong U.S. performance, notably in Instruments, Medical, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities and Mako. Internationally, growth momentum continued against strong double-digit growth organic sales comparables from the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate to accelerate for the remainder of the year as international remains a significant opportunity for us. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.50, reflecting 16.8% growth compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by our strong sales performance and margin expansion. As anticipated, we began to accelerate our M&A activity. We just completed the acquisition of mfPHD, a leading provider of modular stainless steel wall systems. This further enhances our communications business unit portfolio within Endoscopy and helps us meet our customers' needs for turnkey operating room design and construction. At the end of the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of SERF within our Hip business. Our deal pipeline is strong, and we expect to be active over the course of the year. With one quarter behind us, we now expect an increased full year organic sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5%, and we are increasing our adjusted EPS range to $11.85 to $12.05 a share. Coming off organic sales growth of 9.7% in 2022 and 11.5% in 2023, this guidance demonstrates the durability of our high growth and is a testament to our commercial strength and extensive pipeline of innovation across the company. Also, it reinforces our ability to meet our target of 200 basis points of operating margin expansion by 2025. Next, I want to thank our teams for their ongoing commitment to talent and culture, which is reflected in the recognition of Stryker for the 14th year in a row as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our operating model, talent and culture are true differentiators for us. In addition, we recently published our fourth annual comprehensive report, which captures our commitments and disclosures on corporate responsibility. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. Procedural volumes remained strong in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, demographics, a stable pricing environment and healthy patient activity with surgeons. And while pockets of supply constraints remain, our supply continues to be stable overall. Demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our Endoscopy and Medical divisions. Our Mako direct-to-patient campaign continues to perform well, which contributed to our very strong Mako growth with record first quarter installations in both the U.S. and internationally. This will continue to drive our Hips and Knees businesses. In April, we performed our first cases using the Pangea plating system in our Trauma and Extremities division and are gearing up for a full launch. Pangea is the largest launch in trauma's history as it offers a comprehensive system that will enable larger hospital conversions. Next, we received approval from the FDA for our new LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor. This is a flagship product within our emergency care business unit and was one of the catalysts for our acquisition of Physio-Control. LIFEPAK 35 is a modern platform with a touchscreen interface that brings advanced connected capabilities to improve workflow. We will launch this product at the end of Q2, and it will have a multiyear benefit to our Medical division.  Lastly, Mako, Spine and CoPilot are pacing to launch in Q4, followed by the shoulder application at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have been exposed to these technologies. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter compared to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2023. This quarter, we had one less selling day than 2023. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.7%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, almost all of which again contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales in the quarter. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.3%. International organic sales growth was 6.6% against a very strong comparable growth of over 16% in 2023. This performance included positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly in the United Kingdom and Canada and most of our emerging markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.50 in the quarter was up 16.8% from 2023, driven by strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.05. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12% and organic sales growth of 11.6%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 6% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic growth of 19% with strong double-digit growth across the Orthopaedic Instruments and Surgical Technologies businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by almost 50% growth in smoke evacuation and strong performances in power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and SurgiCount. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.1% with double-digit growth in its communications and Endo BU businesses. And from a product perspective, standout growth included cameras, light sources, insufflators, booms and sports medicine implants.  Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.8%, led by the solid sales performances in all 3 businesses. This included strong growth in stretchers, cots, Vocera and Sage products. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 2.9%, highlighted by solid performances in our hemorrhagic stents and guidewires. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 7%, driven by strong performance in our CMF business. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 6%, which included strong performances in our emerging markets. Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 8.3% in the U.S. and 7.4% internationally. Our U.S. Hip business grew 6.8% organically against a very strong comparable of 16.2% in the same quarter last year. This growth reflects continued strong primary hip performance fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem. Our U.S. Knee business grew 3.1% organically against another very strong comparable of 20.7% in the first quarter of 2023. Our Knee growth reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed base. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 10.3% organic with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. Our U.S. Spine business grew 3.9% organically, led by the performance in our Interventional Spine business. Our U.S. other ortho business grew 45.6% organically, driven by strong Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 7.4% organically, including strong performances in Canada and most emerging markets, particularly driven by strong Mako installations. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.6% represents approximately 50 basis points favorability against the first quarter of 2023. This improvement reflects positive pricing trends as well as continued easing of certain cost pressures that we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.8% of sales, which was 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to continued discipline in our spending and investments to support our growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 21.9% of sales, which was approximately 80 basis points favorable to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted other income and expense of $49 million for the quarter was $16 million lower than 2023, driven by favorability in interest rates and a higher level of invested cash resulting in higher interest income. The first quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 12.3%, reflecting the impact of our geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $13 billion. Our total debt includes $600 million of debt that is due to be repaid in May and has been prefunded. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $204 million, reflecting the results of net earnings and normal first quarter seasonal cash outflows. Considering our first quarter results, strong procedural volumes and healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect our full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5% with the pricing impact to be roughly flat. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be moderately unfavorable impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year. EPS will be negatively impacted at the higher end of our previously guided range of $0.05 to $0.10. With our momentum heading into the rest of the year and our commitment to expanding operating margins, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.85 to $12.05. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a really nice quarter. A lot to ask about, but maybe 2 for me on financials. First, Kevin, it sounds like procedure volumes remain really healthy across the globe, and capital equipment, same. Would love to hear if you're seeing any changes, either up or down, in the environment for capital and procedure volume growth. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Yes, we're really pleased with the performance in the first quarter, and really nothing has changed. So the good level of volumes that we're seeing in procedures that we saw through 2024 has continued into 2025. And our capital order book remains very strong. So capital equipment, whether it's large capital or small capital, remains very robust. We have a nice healthy backlog, and that gives us the confidence to raise our organic sales growth guide for the full year. Robert Marcus : And maybe one, probably hasn't been asked on in a while, but your Spine business had a really nice quarter. I wanted to see. Is that more fundamentals and the improvements in technology you've brought to market? Is that gaining some share from disruption of the competitor merger? And is that giving you a foothold ahead of the Spine Mako launch and discussions and how hospitals are open to that? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Not a major change. I would tell you the Interventional Spine business had a terrific quarter. That was really high growth. Our enabling technologies within Spine, the Q Guidance System has really picked up good momentum as well. The Mako Spine and the CoPilot won't be launched until the fourth quarter. So that's not really having much of an impact. And I wouldn't say that the competitive disruption or the competitive merger is really having much of an impact yet. It's still very early days. So nothing too remarkable, but overall, a good number and a good solid number for our Spine business. Operator : Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Larry Biegelsen : Congrats on a nice quarter here. One for Glenn, one for, I think, Kevin. Glenn, just maybe on the EPS raise of about $0.10 at the midpoint. Can you help us bridge kind of how much of that was operational? How much of that is coming from kind of below the line, other income being a little lower? And obviously, FX is a greater headwind. So just kind of the pieces that led to the $0.10 raise, and I had one follow-up, please. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Larry. I think if you look at sort of what happened in OI&E and also what happened with our tax rate, obviously, we had some favorability just for this quarter. I think fundamentally, we're still targeting $250 million roughly in OI&E and attach rate that really is still between 14% and 15%. So we're still sort of holding to the below the op margin line sort of guidance that we had built into our initial guidance that we provided back in January. I think, honestly, if you look at the raise in terms of how we think about it, the robustness of the top line, obviously, the earnings that we're able to kick off of that. And then lastly, we're just -- we're feeling that we're seeing good momentum and positivity around the programs that we put in place to drive leverage to get back to that 2019 number. And so all of that really combines to really give us the confidence to give us that $0.10 raise from the midpoint in EPS. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And Kevin, I'm sure you know investors are concerned about the potential impact of da Vinci 5 on your Endoscopy business. Obviously, it's not having any impact right now. Really strong growth here. I'd love to hear from you kind of if you're willing to share kind of what the potential exposure is and what you can do to help protect your lap tower business long term. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. I'm a little bit mystified by this concern, to be honest with you. If you attended the Sage's meeting, you could clearly see that we have a very differentiated solution that will frankly enable -- they can grow at whatever rates they're growing with their new product, and we're going to continue to have a very strong performance in endoscopy, both this year and for years to come. The overlap in our businesses is minor. We are multi-specialty. We play -- and most of our procedures, frankly, aren't being done robotically today. We also are the clear leader in fluorescence imaging. Just most recently, we had the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, where we partner with CYTALUX, this new fluorophore, to be able to light up lung cancer for lobectomy procedures, which we're the only company that can do that, that can light up that fluorophore. So surgeons are going to demand this for safer surgery, but that doesn't mean that Intuitive can't grow with their robot. We are really playing in spaces with very little overlap, and both of us can continue to have very strong performance for many, many years to come. So to me, this concern is, frankly, mystifying and not at all for me a concern for our Endoscopy division. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : I want to ask about the organic growth and the guidance. If you look at the 10% organic growth this quarter versus the comps and kind of where you're guiding that 9% at the midpoint, the comps essentially do get easier through the balance of the year. And so I'm wondering. Kevin or Glenn, whoever wants to take this, just talk about your guidance view or philosophy for the top line, specifically given the performance and what you think could be better performance for the remainder of the year. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Great. So certainly, if you look at our fourth quarter last year, I wouldn't think that, that was -- those were easy comps. We had a pretty monstrous fourth quarter last year. And so comps is probably the biggest concern that we have, and we do pick up an extra selling day in Q3 and extra selling day in Q4. It's only one quarter, right? There's a lot of uncertainties out there in the marketplace. We feel very good about our business. And I think this is an appropriate raise at this time. Let's see how things go at the end of the second quarter, and we can update you further on the outlook for the year. Ryan Zimmerman : Fair enough. And Kevin, your comments on M&A were pretty pointed. You've highlighted a number of areas previously. I think there was 5 that you specifically called out before. Are you reinforcing those same areas today? Because if I look at just some of the tuck-ins that you've done, it's actually been outside those 4 or 5 areas as of late. And so just curious kind of how you're thinking about the targets for the areas for M&A today. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Certainly, when I talk about those 5 areas, those are adjacencies. So we have our core basically supplementing our existing businesses with new technology. That's always going to be the majority of the deals we do. And beyond that, as we think about adjacencies, those are what I'm calling my sort of top 5 priority adjacencies. And what I'd tell you right now is we have an incredibly healthy pipeline of deals. Now of course, pipeline doesn't always get realized, right? There's always a washout rate as you go through these processes. But I'm feeling really excited about the pipeline. They are mostly in the tuck-in variety. And so they're just like the one I mentioned for our communications business or our Hip business. You're going to see most of those occur at least for the next couple of quarters. Beyond that, if we do decide to branch out, those other areas I talked about are still of high interest. Nothing has really changed on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Very nice quarter. Could you unpack 2 particular areas? One is the Instrument sales up 18%. And then the other is other, up 44.2%. Both of those are real bright, shining stars. I'd love to hear what went behind that. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sure. I can start on the Instruments, and I'll let Jason talk about the other ortho. And you're right, these are bright, shining stars. The Instruments division had a fantastic quarter, and it was really, really across both Surgical Technologies as well as Orthopaedic Instruments. Really across the board. And if you look at smoke evacuation, we just continued to have tremendous momentum. Obviously, the market has been growing very robustly. But we have a terrific commercial execution, growing almost 50%, which is really awesome. And that was great growth in the U.S. and also really great growth internationally. And we see that continuing, maybe not at 50%, but we see that very high double-digit growth through the rest of this year and into next year, especially as more states decide to mandate smoke evacuation. So that was really a big push. We also have the SurgiCount, plus we've launched a new product that combines the Gauss Surgical quantification of blood loss as well as the sponge counting. So it's all combined into one solution, which is really elegant and really being well received by our customers. So those are probably the 2 biggest catalysts within Surgical Technologies. Neptune waste management continues to roll, but that's not new information. And then if you flip over to Orthopaedic Instruments, we have the Steri-Shield doing extremely well. Our power tools, obviously, you know about the new launch that's still, let's call it, just a little -- about 1.5 years in. That's continuing to do very well as well as pulsed lavage and all the other products and just really great commercial execution by the Instruments team. It's really been a flagship division of Stryker, if you go back the last 10-plus years. It delivers very, very consistently, and it did so again in the first quarter. Jason Beach : Yes. Joanne, it's Jason. I'll take the other ortho here. So just a couple of additional comments, I guess, to my prepared remarks would be, like I said, we had a record quarter of installation in the first quarter this year. If you remember, we had a record quarter in the fourth quarter of last year. So the momentum is going really well on the Mako front. I commented on the direct-to-patient campaign. We've seen really good results out of that. So we feel good about it, and we like what this will translate in terms of the Hips and Knees business as we move forward as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Looking at the international growth, can you talk about what you're seeing in Europe versus the higher growth markets like Japan and China? And how should we think about the growth internationally if we're using the 6.8% seen this quarter on a constant currency basis? Kevin Lobo : Yes. So certainly, Europe continues to be a growth engine for Stryker. I would tell you in the first quarter, it was a little bit softer than it has been, and that was really because we had a big quarter last year. So really more comp related. I do expect Europe is going to continue to pick up in Q2, Q3, Q4. So the overall run rates are really healthy in Europe. And we -- the U.K. was a bit of a standout in the first quarter, but the other regions are all going to be fine. We had a really big, big sales in Germany and Southern Europe last year and so -- in the first quarter. So to me, it's just a comp issue. I'm not at all concerned about our international. We're going to have another strong year in international. So you talked about Europe. What else did you say, sorry? [ Was it all ] Europe? Pito Chickering : Great. And then the second question was strong utilization across the country for hospitals and good margins. We're seeing hospitals want to increase their CapEx spending. I guess what areas of your portfolio do you think sort of has the most upside for hospitals increase in the CapEx dollars? Jason Beach : Yes. Pito, I guess what I would say here, as we look at the overall capital environment, and you can see in our results in the first quarter in our capital business is very strong. So we see opportunities here across the board. I think we mentioned that our backlog continues to be elevated here. So we expect strong capital as we go throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Shagun Singh Chadha with RBC Capital. Shagun Singh Chadha : Kevin, you've talked extensively about the super cycle of innovation, and we are seeing strong results here in Q1. Are you able to quantify contribution from new products in Q1? Perhaps talk to us about what's factored into your guidance for 2024. And I guess the key question is, how should investors think about growth drivers for Stryker beyond the current super cycle of innovation? I think you've indicated year 2 and 3 are the peak years. And I think you'd get there in '24 and '25. So how should we think about growth drivers beyond that? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. What I would tell you is we're in this constant rhythm of innovation. And we just had a number of products sort of collide at the same time, but they're constantly being refreshed. So I wouldn't think about this as a fleeting moment. If you think about 9.7% in '22, 11.5% in '23, another potentially double digit, we'll see. We're not guiding to that just yet, but we have a chance certainly to get to another double-digit growth this year, and next year, you're going to have the impact. We're just launching LIFEPAK 35. It's not going to have as much of an impact this year as next year. Pangea not as much impact this year as next year. The Mako applications have really no impact this year. It's really more next year. And then we'll just keep rolling other innovations on top of that. So I would just think we were in a rhythm. Assuming the market conditions stay similar, we're in a rhythm where this kind of high growth is what you should come to expect from us with no end in sight as long as we continue to invest as we are, roughly 7% of our growing top line in new product innovation, and we continue to be active with acquisitions because as you know, we acquire high-growth assets. And then after the first year that rolls into organic growth, we had a bit of a pause last year as we're going to refill that tank this year, and that will contribute to organic growth in the years ahead. So I would not look at this as some kind of we reached a peak, and we're starting -- we're going to come down on the other side. Absent some kind of market adjustment, this is -- we're in kind of a new normal, at least for a while. Shagun Singh Chadha : That's really helpful. And then just a couple of follow-ups on the ortho side. Just any updates on Mako for spine and shoulder robot? Are you still on track for 2024 and a year-end '24 launch for both of those? Jason Beach : Shagun, it's Jason. Just -- I'll go back to my prepared remarks, right? As we think about Mako Spine and CoPilot, we're looking at a Q4 launch there. And for Mako shoulder, it will be the end of this year from a launch standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Kevin, I had one for you on the backlog comments here, both on the procedures and the capital side, right? On procedures, [indiscernible], can you comment on any scheduling? I think historically, scheduling was taking time. It was elongated. Have you seen any shortening of that scheduling still elongated? How have cancellations sort of trended? I think on the capital side, you mentioned LIFEPAK. Did that contribute in the backlog? Or is that something that's supposed to come in the coming quarters? Kevin Lobo : Look, I'd just call it a stable market. It really hasn't changed much, if you think about waiting lists. If you think about staffing, it's continually gotten better over the course of '24. So I would just say it's very stable in terms of the overall market. I don't see shortening at all. I don't see it elongating. It's just as we saw through '24 -- '23, sorry, it's a continuation into '24 of that kind of stable marketplace. And the new defibrillator just got approved. So that's not really been a big contributor to our backlog. Our backlog is just a healthy order book of all of our existing products across medical, across even some of the Instruments businesses and Endoscopy. So it really -- there wasn't any kind of new spike, but we've had a healthy backlog. We had it going into '23. We have it going into '24. We continue to get good orders. So yes, we're shipping out at a nice rate, but the orders are still coming in at a very healthy rate. So we're really not burning through any kind of meaningful backlog, and that gives us confidence for at least through the rest of this year if -- and as orders continue, and it obviously could potentially spike with some of these new products. That's only going to give us more tailwind for growth. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Kevin. And Glenn, maybe one for you. Free cash in the quarter looks like there was some timing element. Can you just remind us what kind of free cash conversion should we be expecting for fiscal '24? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. Yes. I think in Q1, what you saw was just timing between working capital in Q4 and Q1. And then just sort of seasonally in Q1, we have higher cash outflows that occur. So that's the impact of that. On an overall basis, there's no change to the targets that we discussed back at the analyst meeting in November, and that would be the 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion number. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : Congrats on a good quarter. On the Mako installations, curious -- big insulation number, but curious how many of those are going into competitive accounts. And is that a leading indicator for share gains in ortho? Jason Beach : Travis, it's Jason. I mean for competitive reasons, we won't necessarily disclose the number in terms of the amount going into competitive accounts. But I will say that number is big for us and continues to be a winner for us in terms of going into competitive accounts. Travis Steed : Great. And then the 50% growth in smoke evacuation, was that a big step change versus where it's been running at? And I'm just curious if there was something that drove that acceleration in smoke evacuation, if it's kind of better bundling across the portfolio or more reps pushing that product. Jason Beach : Yes, Travis, it's Jason. I'd say a couple of different things here. The smoke evac business has continued to be, I think, high teens, 20% grower. In smoke-free states, it's higher than that and similar to kind of what we said today in the prepared remarks. So it's been a great tailwind for us, and we think it will be into the future. Kevin Lobo : Yes. We've also had our supply chain has really improved in terms of being able to meet the tremendous demand that we've had, and that was also a contributor. So we've had tremendous growth, tremendous demand. And our supply chain has really kicked in, in a strong way, and that puts us in a good position not only to deliver in the first quarter but also to deliver in the quarters ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: Just real quick, it sounds like Mako is getting -- Mako Spine is being pushed out. Just I don't know if it's 3 to 6 months. Is that about right? And then is it a software issue, hardware issue, something else you're going to incorporate into it that's causing this modest push? Jason Beach : Matt, it's Jason. I mean keep in mind, right, from a regulatory standpoint, there's time lines as it relates to the FDA that can shift things by week, sometimes a couple of months. We've always been targeting a back half launch here. So I wouldn't consider this as a significant change in the time line. As you think about the guidance that we have for this year, there was certainly nothing assumed in terms of our guide relative to the spine or shoulder launch. So no impact there as we think about that. Matthew O'Brien: Got it. And then on the MedSurg side of things, I think, Kevin, you've said double-digit growth is what you expect for the next 5 years there. Is that needing to have the backlog? And I mean is there any way to quantify how significant that backlog is right now and how much of a tailwind it is versus all these new products that you got coming like defibrillators, et cetera? Because the Street is nowhere near double-digit growth for the MedSurg business over the next couple of years. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, I don't think I said that. I have to double check the transcript, but I didn't give a precise number of double-digit growth for all that time. What I did say is we are in this high-growth environment based on our innovation cycle, and we're going to continue to have these new products fuel growth. It does depend on the market, right? So if the market stays at this kind of level, could we stay in that kind of double-digit range? Sure, we could. But I -- there's no guarantee that the market will stay this elevated both in terms of procedures as well as the healthy capital environment. So it does depend on the market. And obviously, you know we outperformed the market, and you can -- depending on the year, it's 300 basis points or whatever that number is. But we're not going to defy gravity. If the market falls down to a certain level, then obviously, our growth would be similarly impacted. So I don't believe I was that precise with double-digit over 5 years. But I do feel bullish about the ability for us to continue to be a very high-growth business. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matthew Miksic : Congrats on a really strong quarter, which looks to me like and a lot of the feedback I'm getting is that it really is just all about comps. I mean double-digit organic growth against low teens -- low to mid-teens organic growth last year is -- that is at least impressive to us. So congrats on the continued momentum. I had one follow-up, if I could, on the Mako robot and maybe just the nature of the launch. If you could walk us through, is that you're expecting a limited launch and then sort of picking up momentum in 2025? And then, Kevin, if you could maybe talk about some of the either new aspects of that platform or some of the other products that you're kind of excited about in the next couple of quarters that they will start coming to market and adding to growth in the back half in '25. I appreciate it. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Sure. Thanks. Jason, every quarter, we'll talk to you about new products. And we highlighted a couple this quarter with the LIFEPAK 35 and Pangea in our trauma business, both of which are really super exciting products that are going to contribute to growth for at least a few years to come. As it relates to Mako, so the new spine robot will be 2 parts. One part is the actual robot with a different attachment that will enable the pedicle screw guidance. The second part is the Q Guidance trade that's already being sold today. So that is used for first-line procedures. It's a very lightning fast camera. You saw it at NASS. It's being sold today to do navigated spine procedures. So those 2 components will make up the Mako Spine system. And then in addition to that, the CoPilot product will be able to do diskectomies and bone preparation with haptic feedback to be able to protect you from getting close to vital structures, spinal cord, et cetera. So that -- and that, again, is going to be compatible with the Q camera in the same screen. So it's a comprehensive ecosystem that will be launched. And we're already seeding the market with 1/2 of the system with the Q Guidance, and then the second half is really whether you're doing makeover pedicle screw placement or using Q Guidance to do the bone preparation. So those are the 3 pieces of our enabling technology solution, part of which we're already selling today. So every time we're selling Q, which is contributing to our spine growth, it's part of the solution that will then be able to be used both with CoPilot as well as with Mako. So hopefully, that clarifies things for you. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Congrats on a really strong start to the year. I guess, Glenn, this is probably a question for you on that 150 bps target for operating margin expansion. I mean just based -- I know it's early. You guys just [ gave ] this about 6 months ago. So not trying to be too greedy, but 80 bps year-over-year in Q1, it sounds like things are actually only getting better from here as it relates to super cycle of product. Inflation presumably starts to continue to ease, hopefully. So I guess just any comments you can make about that 150 bps target based on what you guys did here in Q1. And that's it for me. Glenn Boehnlein : Okay. Yes. First, just so we're clear, the target is 200 basis points over the next 2 years, '24 and '25. And that's what we presented back at Analyst Day back in November. It's also the kind of the guidance we brought out in January. I think if you do the rough math, just based on our guidance, you'll see that we're in the realm of 100 basis points or 100 basis points plus in this first year. .  And you're correct, 80 basis points is a great start to the year. Seasonally, as we think about how this plays out for this year, we expect sort of second half margin expansion to be stronger than first half just given the seasonality of earnings that we see as the year plays out. No change in sort of our overall approach. If you think about what we did in 2023, you saw margin expansion coming through gross margin. 2024, we think and we expect that we'll see op expenses will lead more of the margin expansion. And then our goals in 2025 will likely be more balanced between gross margin and operating expenses. There are lots of programs we have in place. I mean you've seen the results that we've had in price. We also have low-cost greenfield site, strategic in-sourcing. We'll continue to push shared services efficiencies, IT harmonization. And then honestly, if you just look at the natural leverage that we drive when we're growing at the high levels, that also is a piece of this equation. So we're excited about the Q1 performance. We will still continue to be working on it through the remainder of this year and into next year, and we'll update you quarterly as the earnings calls play forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Pangea and LIFEPAK as 2 upcoming catalysts and maybe frame any acceleration or pickup we could see from those products. How material could they be? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Well, I'd say -- if you look at our trauma business, core trauma, so excluding upper extremities and lower extremities, if you look at core trauma, we've been historically the leading nailing company in the marketplace. But we haven't been the leading plating company. Now we have some terrific places, whether it's our clavicle platters, our pelvic products. But we didn't have a comprehensive system of variable angle plating. This is an amazing product launch, very comprehensive and will really be a shot in the arm for plating, which, by the way, is more than half of the procedures in trauma are plating versus nailing. And so we are wildly excited about this launch. We already have an incredibly high-performing core trauma business, fabulous leadership in our core trauma. And now we have a fabulous comprehensive plating solution. We've done roughly 40 cases so far. Feedback has been excellent from the surgeons. We -- it will take us time. We have to build out the sets, and these kind of launches take time to sort of fully roll out. But you're going to start to see the impact as early as Q3. We're going to have some procedures obviously done in Q2. It won't be too big of an impact, but it will start to have more of an impact in Q3, Q4 and beyond. And as it relates to LIFEPAK, we are bringing in our sales force for a full sort of launch preparation in May, and we'll start to have our first shipments sometime in June. So there won't be much of an impact at all in Q2, but certainly going into Q3, Q4. We did show the product that a recent fire display conference -- firehouses, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. People were 7 and 8 rows deep looking at the product. It is -- we're really getting fantastic feedback. And so we're building the product right now and getting ready for a launch. And these kind of launches, because of the price point, you're not going to see probably as big an impact this year as you would see -- you'll see some, obviously. Medical is already performing incredibly well. But you'll see some impact this year, but you're going to see a lot more in the next 2 to 3 years after that. These are long-cycle products. They last a long time, and we know how to replace capital equipment at Stryker, and we're going to be doing that. It's incredibly exciting. The last sort of big defibrillator that we launched was almost 20 years ago. So there is a huge replacement market for this modern and really fully featured product. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord. Caitlin Cronin : Congrats on the strong performance this quarter. Just turning to upper extremity, you noted strong performance there. Any changing dynamics with the CMS ruling and ASC's hospital patient earlier this year? And can we also get a refresher on the new products coming in your Shoulder portfolio and the timing of those? Jason Beach : Caitlin, it's Jason. As we think about upper extremities, this continues to be a fast grower for us. As we think about kind of transition and the opportunity in the ASC, no change from that perspective. And we expect this will continue to be a fast-growing business for us. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And as it relates to product launches, I think we talked about this on the last call, but we have about 5 products that are either going into full launch that we're in partial launch or are being launched. We have a perform fracture system, which is really exciting, a reverse stemless product. We have the pyrocarbon, which is hemiarthroplasty product. We have the hollow lens, which is -- you can visualize the surgery in the operating room. That was a limited launch last year. That's going to move to full launch. And I think it's the fifth one, Jason, the number? Jason Beach : Those were the -- those were the big... Kevin Lobo : Those are the main 4 ones. But there's a fifth one. I can't remember right now. But if you look -- go back to the last call, I think we did highlight all of those products. So this is a business that's been growing roughly 20% every single quarter. That continued. We have a very strong first quarter. And we expect that to continue not seeing any real change in the market dynamics at all where we have tremendous momentum, and we expect that momentum to continue. Caitlin Cronin : Great. And then just a question [indiscernible] given it's post close now what the strengths do you really see that bringing to your Hip portfolio going forward? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Well, firstly, if you look at our business in Europe, it gives us tremendous market share in France. And the dual-mobility, they were the originators of dual-mobility, and they have a terrific portfolio of products not just for France, but certainly, they're well known throughout Europe. And then eventually even some of those products, we'll be looking to bring those to the United States. So it really gives us a shot in the arm in Europe where, as you know, we've historically had lower market shares than other parts of the world. So we're very excited about this product. The feedback so far from surgeons has been excellent. They're very differentiated products that are -- that have a lot of history behind them and are really well received in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist. Samuel Brodovsky : This is actually Sam on for Rich. I appreciate the commentary you guys gave earlier on margins being stronger or expansion being stronger in the second half. But just as we think about the 80 basis points of expansion this quarter, is that reasonable to think about as a floor on a quarterly basis this year? Or maybe should we think about a step back in 2Q? Jason Beach : Sam, it's Jason. I'll take this one, and Glenn can pile on anything additional here. But again, to Glenn's comments, as you think about the margin expansion getting to 100 bps on a full year basis being second half weighted, it certainly would imply that you could have a quarter less than that from a margin expansion standpoint. Certainly, margin expansion in every quarter, but I wouldn't necessarily say it'd be to the levels of what you saw in Q1 every quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Jennings with TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I was hoping to just dig into the 20 bps of pricing pressure experienced by the Orthopaedics and Spine units. Any chance you can help us think more -- provide more details on the pricing headwind experienced by the total joint franchise Knees and Hips? And then at AAOS, it seems like there's -- and still with your guidance that there's optimism that the macro device industry may be in a new kind of era of pricing. Any updated thoughts there? And then just one follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. I mean if you think about pricing, we do sort of -- there are sort of a tale of 2 cities. On the MedSurg side, we generally are able to gain pricing. There's certainly a premium placed on technology, and we work through contracts that provide bands of pricing that allow us to approach customers. On the ortho side, you're right. Traditionally, it's been a market that has had price declines. I would say that as we think about our ortho business 5 years ago or even 6 years ago, we were looking at price declines that were in the 3% to 5% range. And I would say now what we're feeling and based on the contract sort of discipline that we have put in place with customers as well as sort of maybe a little bit of the impact of Mako being a closed system, we're feeling that we see sort of less negative price performance on the ortho side of our business. But we don't necessarily anticipate that ortho will ever get to positive, but we are feeling confident about less negative. Joshua Jennings : And maybe just a follow-up. I was hoping you could share your outlook on the knee and hip markets. I think at AOS, our interpretation of some comments from your team and other orthopedic management teams was that we could see a higher level of growth in those markets relative to the pre-pandemic era. Just wanted to follow up. Any updated thoughts there? And also, there's been concerns about just the utilization headwind after a strong second half last year, broadly in the macro devices industry. And any thoughts on whether we should be thinking about a slowdown in utilization or procedure volumes in orthopedics in the second half here this year? Jason Beach : Josh, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I'd say a couple of different things here. As we think about the market, our view has really not changed at all here. Even if you go back to Investor Day in November of last year, we said the ortho markets would grow, call that mid-single digit area. And we would outperform that 200 to 300 bps above that. So as we think about the full year this year, that's kind of how we're looking at the markets, and we feel as good as ever about that. Operator : Our final question comes from Andrew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ranieri : Kevin, just 2 for you. Would you mind just talking about the trends you're seeing internationally in Mako? Any plans for geographic expansion in 2024? And really kind of like what utilization levels you're seeing with the Mako system outside the U.S.? And then second, just with the Gauss Surgical product, you touched on that. But can you also give us any more color on where you think you can take the product next within your MedSurg portfolio? Kevin Lobo : Okay. Great. So firstly, on international, what we're seeing is kind of the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. about 5 or 6 years ago. We are installing a large number of robots, and those tend to be leading indicators. And as you install those, then they start to do the procedures, and you see growth in the implants. So there, where we were 5, 6 years ago, it's really picking up in India, Japan, for sure. Even parts of Europe are picking up. We already had strength in the U.K., but we're picking up in other parts of Europe. China is still a bit small but starting to pick up as well. Korea is on fire for us with Mako. We're still a bit sluggish in Latin America. I'd say that's still a big opportunity for us, and there are hospitals that are demanding it. And we have to kind of -- we've made some changes in our own structure to really be able to address that opportunity. But overall, it's target rich. It's later in the market cycle than it has been in the U.S. and in Australia. Even Canada is starting to really pick up, and that's a very new dynamic. They were very, very late to the Mako story. And so we're very excited not just with the number of installations. You've seen multiple quarters of international really humming on installations. But that is a gift that will keep on giving. We've seen this in every market where you have large installations. It is a precursor for significant high-growth quarter after quarter. So very excited about the international opportunity. And it's still early days in many of these markets. So, so far so good. We're excited in the reception. Frankly, the most important thing is utilization. And so as we make sure these robots are being installed, are they being used at a high rate. And frankly, today, the country with the highest utilization for robot is India, the highest in the world. But it's picking up in other markets as well. The second part of your question was on Gauss. So yes, we're really excited about Gauss. Obviously, this was an AI solution that we acquired to quantify hemoglobin for delivery as well as other general surgery procedures, and they had sort of a different kind of interface for the health care worker. We've improved that interface to make it a lot easier to use and combined that with our SurgiCount product -- I'm sorry, the, yes, SurgiCount, so the sponge counting. But this is also -- so measuring the blood in the sponge and the canister but also counting the sponges to make sure those sponges are left in the body. There's ideas that we have about how we can connect to this tablet and have other devices tied to the tablet. It's a common tablet being used for both solutions. I'm not ready yet to talk about what that will be. There's a lot of other connectivity discussions going on inside Stryker, particularly with Vocera. At Vocera, obviously, we have the bed now connected to the Vocera badges in that system, and there are a lot of other discussions about what else can we connect with Vocera. It's just a little premature for us to talk to you about what those are. I think I'd rather have those products ready for launch and then talk about it. But clearly, we are looking at workflow and bringing better IT solutions for our customers, really looking at that across the portfolio. How can we improve workflow in the hospitals? How can we reduce errors for hospital acquired conditions? Safety and outcomes is a big focus of many of our MedSurg divisions. And I think we're on a really good track. Did I ever think we'd buy an app on an iPhone, which is really what Gauss is? No. But that's the future. And that's going to be our focus. And Vocera, obviously, was a bigger foray into the digital solution world, but don't expect that this will be the end. And I can see within our deal pipeline, HIT is going to feature and don't be surprised if we continue to do both organic innovation as well as acquisitions to bolster our presence within HIT. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you for joining our call. As you can see, 2024 is shaping up to be another strong year for Stryker. We look forward to sharing our Q2 results with you in July. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. In the second quarter, we delivered strong organic growth sales of 9% against last year's nearly 12% comparable. Our performance included high single digit growth across both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects our diverse business model, sustained demand for our products and our team's strong commercial execution. Our organic growth was well balanced between the US and international with both growing roughly 9%. Our strong results were led by double-digit organic growth in instruments, neuro cranial and Mako and high single digit growth in our medical, endoscopy, neurovascular, trauma and extremities and knee businesses. Internationally, our organic sales growth accelerated from the first quarter with strength in Europe, emerging markets, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. As we expand our global share, we continue to see international markets as a key catalyst for our long-term growth. On the M&A front, we continue to execute on our offense. In July, we completed the acquisition of Artelon, which specializes in innovative soft tissue fixation products for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures. Also yesterday, we closed our acquisition of MOLLI Surgical. MOLLI offers wire free soft tissue localization technology that allows surgeons to precisely mark the location of lesions for removal during breast cancer surgeries. MOLLI's differentiated technology enhances our endoscopy portfolio. We remain bullish about our deal pipeline and we expect continued activity as we move into the back half of the year. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.81, reflecting 10.6% growth compared to the second quarter of 2023. This performance was primarily driven by the strength of our sales as well as continued expansion of our margins. Finally, we are raising our expectations for 2024 and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share of. Coming off full year organic sales growth of 11.5% in 2023, our updated guidance reflects the strength of our capital backlog, innovative product portfolio, healthy procedure volumes and passionate commercial execution across the globe. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and select product highlights. Procedural volumes remained robust in the second quarter driven by strong fundamentals, increased adoption of robotic assisted surgery and healthy patient activities with surgeons. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand as we move into the second half of the year. Demand for our capital products also remained healthy in the quarter with continued elevated backlog across our endoscopy and medical divisions. Continued patient interest in Mako contributed to our best ever second quarter for installations worldwide and in the US with high utilization rates across the globe. Also in the quarter, we reached over 1 million robotic total knee procedures performed to date with Mako and Triathlon. We expect the growing momentum in installations and utilization will continue to drive sustained growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our recent product introductions highlight our commitment to innovation and the durability of our innovation cycle. Pangea's comprehensive plating system complements our market leading nailing portfolio and will enable sustained above market growth in our core trauma business. We expect Pangea availability to continue to ramp and reach full launch in the US by the second half of 2025. Next, our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor continues to drive significant excitement in the marketplace. This flagship product within our emergency care business unit was launched near the end of the second quarter with a strong order book, and we believe it will have a multiyear benefit to our medical division. Lastly, we announced this morning that we received FDA clearance for our Spine Guidance 5 Software featuring Copilot, which introduces smart powered instruments to our Q guidance ecosystem. This innovative technology is designed to support surgeon precision by providing auditory and sensory alerts when approaching anatomical boundaries during spinal procedures and enhanced patient safety and outcomes. Copilot is an important step on our development pipeline which also includes Mako Spine. Mako Spine with Copilot is on track to launch in Q4 and Mako's Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 9% in the second quarter compared to 11.9% in the same quarter of 2023. Average selling days are in line with 2023. We had a 1.1% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see positive trends in our pricing initiatives, particularly in our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.9% unfavorable impact on sales. In the US, organic sales growth was 9%. International organic sales growth was 8.9%, driven by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.81 in the quarter was up 10.6% from 2023, driven by higher sales and partially offset by foreign currency exchange translation which had an unfavorable impact of $0.03. Now we'll provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 9.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included 10.1% of US organic growth and 8.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had US organic sales growth of 11.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and Steri-Shield. Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 8% with strong growth in its core endoscopy business and its sports medicine business. This growth was led by the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder and knee products. This was somewhat offset by slower communication sales due to the timing of installations which will recover in the second half of this year. Medical had US organic sales growth of 11.9%, driven by strong sales performances in its emergency care and sage businesses with growth in transport capital, defibrillators and sage products. Neurovascular had US organic sales growth of 2.3% which reflects some US supply disruption related to flow diversion products. And finally, Neuro Cranial had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, led by double-digit growth in our bone mill, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 8.2%, led by double-digit organic growth in our instruments, neurovascular and neuro cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in China, Australia and Japan. Orthopaedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.9% and organic sales growth of 8%, which included organic growth of 7.3% in the US and 9.8% internationally. Our US knee business grew 6.6% organically, reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base. Our US hip business grew 4.3% organically, fueled by our insignia hip stem. Our US trauma and extremities business grew 9.1% organically, with strong performances across our upper extremities, biologics and core trauma businesses. Our US spine business grew 4.4% organically, led by the performance in our interventional spine business. Our US other ortho business grew 15.4% organically, particularly driven by robust continued momentum of Mako installations. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 9.8% organically, including strong performances in Canada, Europe and most emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.2% represents approximately 30 basis points of favorability against the second quarter of 2023 and 60 basis points sequentially as compared to the first quarter of this year. This favorability primarily reflects positive pricing trends and improved material cost and manufacturing efficiencies. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.5% of sales, which was approximately 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.1% of sales, which was consistent with the second quarter of 2023. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.6% of sales, which was approximately 30 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $54 million for the quarter was $12 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income in our invested cash balances. The second quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete items. For 2024, we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of approximately $12.2 billion. During the quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt that came due in May. Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $837 million, reflecting the results of net earnings somewhat offset by working capital changes. Based on our year-to-date performance and our positive outlook related to sustained procedural volumes and a healthy demand for our capital products, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%, with favorable pricing impacting of approximately 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate a moderately unfavorable impact on the full year sales and now expect EPS will be negatively impacted in the range of $0.10 to $0.15. This is reflected in our guidance. Given our sales momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.10 per share. And now I will open the call up for questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter here. So, Kevin, it's hard to not notice the quote in the press release about you're being excited about the product and M&A pipeline. So I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on M&A in 2024. You've talked about smaller deals in the first half and potentially larger deals in the second half. Is there any change to your view, and how should we think about the impact of larger deals on the margin targets you have for '24 and '25? And I had one follow up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, we're still committed to our margin targets of 200 basis points, roughly 100 basis points this year, another 100 basis points next year. And that is inclusive of M&A. We do have a very active deal pipeline. Most of them are in the tuck-in variety and most of them are not very large. But you continue to see us be active, as you've seen in the first two quarters of the year, much more active than we were last year. And we will be very active in the second half of the year. It's always hard to predict exactly which deals will land, as you know. But we have a very strong balance sheet now, given the debt that we paid down after Wright and Vocera, and we're going to put our balance sheet to work. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's helpful. And Glenn, in order to hit the margin goal for this year, it requires a pretty big step up in the margins in the second half. What are the drivers? Is it gross margin or OpEx? And what's your visibility? Thank you. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Larry, really good question. I think if you looked at our performance historically, you would always see that op margin leverage in the second half of the year just really, really takes off. And so I don't think this year is really going to be different from performances in past years. I would tell you that we're seeing, like you saw here in the first half of this year, kind of a good balance, honestly between gross margin and SG&A. I think moving forward in the back half of the year, just given sort of how we spend in SG&A our variable comp models, we'll probably see more leverage come out of SG&A than gross margin in the back half of the year. And we're very bullish on, like Kevin said, still holding to our 100 basis points of op margin expansion for this year. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Your line is not open. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. I'll just ask them upfront. Kevin, you guys don't guide quarter to quarter and I saw you during the quarter -- I know you've made a bunch of public comments and the quarter came just in line versus the Street. Again, you don't guide quarterly. I understand that. But you did raise guidance for the year. So I was hoping you can reconcile inline versus the Street 2Q with the confidence to raise the guide both on the top and bottom. And then the second question, I imagine part of that is also. What you're seeing and the visibility you have into the capital equipment and procedure volume complex? Just maybe you could touch on that as well. Thanks a lot. Kevin Lobo : Yeah, sure. Thanks Robbie. And thanks for remembering that we don't guide to quarters. We were actually very pleased with the way the quarter played out. We can see our seasonality and how things are going to flow from quarter to quarter. We had a big Q2 last year, big comp. If you look at the back half of the year, we're very bullish on capital. We have a big backlog, particularly in endoscopy and in medical. We're also seeing very strong demand. As you've seen, quarter after quarter, our Mako installations are very high. That leads to future strong demand for hips and knees. And July is off to a really strong start in joint replacement. We've also been able to achieve more price than we thought at the beginning of the year, and we expect that that price tailwind will continue into the back half of the year. And lastly, I'd say the new products, the two big products we've talked about, Pangea and LIFEPAK 35, are both receiving tremendous positive feedback and really both had very negligible impact in Q2. But you're going to see those in a big way in Q3, Q4, and into next year. So a lot of tailwinds that are going to push our growth up in Q3. Certainly in Q3 is going to be a big one and also in Q4. So we're very confident of raising the guide. Love the fact that we have 10% at the high end of our growth coming off a year of 11.5% last year and 9.7% the year before. So we are growing off big numbers and we're feeling very good about the top line. Robert Marcus : Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter here. I want to kind of dovetail on Robbie's question a little bit and appreciate that there's some product drivers in the back half of the year. Kevin, there's some easier comps. Can you just comment maybe on seasonal dynamics a little bit, and expectations around the health of the orthopedic market, the ability to see kind of that sustained growth rate through the back half of the year and then potentially into 2025? And then I have one question for Glenn on pricing. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Listen, we're not changing our story on the market. So we've been saying for many quarters now that we see this, the hip and knee market as kind of a mid single digit market and our ability to outpace that market largely on the backs of Mako, as well as insignia for hips. But that's the same story we've been telling. And frankly, we're seeing that. And we're seeing that in July. As we talk to surgeons and see their surgery schedules, we see a healthy and sustained good market for hips and knees elevated from pre-pandemic and something that we see through the end of this year and potentially into next year. Ryan Zimmerman : Very helpful. And then, just the second question for me around pricing, Glenn, I mean, it's really nice to see the tailwind that you're getting from pricing. As you think about pricing as an opportunity, I mean, do you see an upper bound on pricing where you can't go beyond that? I mean, how long can you sustainably push pricing as you think about both this year and then potentially into 2025. Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Maybe I'll limit my comments really just to 2024. So I would tell you that if you just look at our pricing teams and what they've accomplished, first of all, we've seen really great positive outcome on the MSNT side and related to the MSNT products. And I would tell you that if you think about their product cycle and how they introduce new innovations, we'll constantly gain price on those innovations. I would tell you that on the ortho side, I'm equally pleased. We're addressing this in contracts as they come up. And frankly, we're less negative. We are just less negative than we used to be on ortho, which honestly is a win. I would tell you that this carries over not just to the people at our enterprise level that are working on this, but it's down in the field with our salespeople. So the divisions have put in various programs that drive certain incentives related to positive pricing or improvements in margins. And so my money's on our salesforce in terms of keeping this going. That's what I would say. I would tell you that if you just look at our performance year-to-date in Q1, 0.7%, 1.1% in Q2, in the back half of the year, we're going to see some anniversary of products and contracts. And so there may be a little bit of moderation. But I do think that to Kevin's point, there's a lot of newer products that are going to be out there that are going to drive price that maybe isn't necessarily captured in here, but I'm bullish on it. I think we'll continue to see really good price performance this year, and I'll hold my comments till we guide 2025. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much, and very nice quarter. I'm trying to figure out where to go here because there's so much. I'm going to pause on Mako. It sounds like when I look at my notes, the fourth quarter '23 was record Mako, first quarter '24 was record Mako, second quarter the same. What is going on that each quarter you're placing record Mako robots. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Thanks. I'll take that question. So, first of all, a big contributor is international. Joanne. We are really picking up the pace in international, particularly in countries like Japan, some of the emerging markets, India, and even Europe. So international is really where the US was four or five years ago. That is a new -- I would say a new tailwind. Obviously, we are very well penetrated in Australia, but the rest of international has lagged. That is now coming on and coming on strong. And that on top of the US organization, that's really done a terrific job continuing to promote Mako and the use of Mako. And every quarter, the percent of hips and knees on the robot is actually increasing. And the demand, as more offerings came on the market, people got a chance to look at that and they clearly are preferring our technology and we're winning in the marketplace, and people are putting in their fifth system and their 6th system and their seventh system. And so there are a lot of ours that still don't have Makos in them. And our teams are out there hunting, so we're super excited. I think the software changes we made with the 4.0 software for hip, the 2.0 software for knee with functional alignment, these have been really sort of quiet successes that have fueled growth. And then, of course, we're going to add spine and then shoulder to Mako. So it's an engine that still has a lot, a lot of juice in the tank. Joanne Wuensch : Just as a follow up to that, with spine and shoulder coming on, how do you anticipate rolling those out? Are there software and hardware upgrades? Just walk us through that. Thank you and have a great night. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thank you. Yes. In both cases, there are attachments. So it's the same robot that you can use, but there are attachments that would be specifically for spine as well as software. So it comes with both software and hardware, just as the knee application did when we launched the total knee back in 2017. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is not open. Please go ahead. Kevin Lobo : Vijay? Hello, Vijay, we can't hear you. Operator : We'll go to the next question. We'll go to Travis Steed with BofA Global Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. First, start with. So, Stryker, typically 9% to 10% growth this year, kind of well above the historical growth rate for Stryker. So a question I get a lot is how sustainable is this level of growth? And kind of look at some of the growth drivers this year. What are these drivers going to sustainable next year? Anything getting better, getting worse over the next one to two years? Just kind of curious, your confidence of kind of sustaining this kind of above normal Stryker growth rate going forward. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Let me start by two years ago we grew 9.7% organically. Last year we grew 11.5% organically. This year we're growing 9% to 10% organically. So I think we are showing that we can sustain high growth over multiple years. If I think about next year, these two big flagship launches in trauma and in medical are really only going to take much more of an impact next year. They'll have some impact obviously in the back half, but a bigger impact next year. Our camera launch is still gaining steam. Our ProCurity launch still has years ahead of it. Our power tool launch still has plenty of opportunity. Mako is going to continue to expand as it has been actually both internationally, which is a giant opportunity, as well as in the United States. Our international growth has been high single digit, double-digit for the last few years. That's going to continue. We still have huge opportunities in international. And then as we get back to our M&A offense, recall that we tend to buy fast growing assets. Thats part of our formula. And after one year that then rolls into organic growth. So I'm bullish on the future of our ability to sustain high organic growth. If you think about this year, a lot of the organic growth is actually not M&A related. It's really product cycle, innovation cycle and all of our innovation teams as I travel around and meet our different divisions, they have tremendous innovation. Mako Spine hasn't had any impact yet, nor has Copilot, nor has Mako Shoulder. So there is plenty of room for high growth in this company. And the expectations have changed. If you go back 10 years ago, we were growing 4%, 5%, 6% organically and that has clearly changed. And there are new expectations and we continue to split business units and split salesforces and play offense. And it's a formula that's working and I don't see it slowing down anytime soon. Travis Steed : Super helpful. And another question I'm getting more lately is kind of your interest in soft tissue surgical robotics, if that's going to change at all or how you're thinking about that market. I know it's a market you guys have looked at closely for many years now. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Look, it's an area that we like as a space. It's complicated, and there is room for more than one big player, if you think about all the types of procedures that are done that are not done robotically. But we're going to be cautious and careful about how we choose to enter. Fortunately for us, we're not defending any business in this case. This would be all playing offense if we decide to move into that space. So we do like it. There are a lot of startups, as you know, that are in the space. We've looked at many. We haven't pulled the trigger. I'm not going to predict if we will or if we won't. We don't need to get into it. But it's an attractive space and there are still a very small fraction of general surgery procedures that are done robotically. And so there is that opportunity. We're going to continue to explore it, but we explore multiple adjacencies. That's not the only one that we like, and I can't predict which one we're going to enter first or second or third. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot, Kevin. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start with, Glenn, as I look at the stock, it's down about 5% in the aftermarkets. And I think it's related to this margin concern that Larry surfaced in the back half. If I go back several years for Stryker, you put up this type of growth in operating margins in the back half of the year, but typically off the easy comps, you have tougher comps this time around. So can you be a little more specific in terms of where you can see some of these improvements on the margin side, especially in SG&A? And then how do you do that without potentially impacting strength areas on the top line and impacting the top line in next year or even in '26? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. I think, first of all, a couple of things. If you look at getting margin out of gross profit or getting margin out of SG&A, I mean, a lot of the drivers are honestly in our control. You look at hiring, that's completely in our control. You look at travel and meetings completely in our control. And so a lot of these just come down to say good budgeting, let's say, in terms of how we plan it and how we know that we have the confidence that we're going to be able to drive that margin. The other thing is if we look at when we grow with these sort of lofty rates across a lot of our businesses, those are growing off of fixed cost basis where it just drives natural leverage that will drive in our business. So we won't be spending at a comparable level. And if you look at Q4 time in and time out, that honestly has been what's happening. We also have a lot of exciting things that are going on. And if you look at what we're doing in supply chain and changes that we're making there in terms of working with vendors, working down some of those inflation charges that we took over the last two years. We also look at low-cost manufacturing. We have facilities now in Poland and also in Mexico, where we're sourcing product in those. And then lastly, sort of back into operating expenses. We continue to push more and more of that day to day transactional work into these shared service centers, which are at a third of the cost of what we see in sort of our developed areas, US and Europe, primarily. So honestly, I think we have a very good pathway to deliver that 100 basis points. And we wouldn't have talked about it so loudly if we weren't confident that we did have a plan that is going to get us there. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Got it. I appreciate that. And then just on the -- across the portfolio, everything's doing well, with a couple of modest exceptions. I mean, neurovascular is doing pretty well. I think there's a little hiccup in the quarter. I don't -- Kevin, I didn't really hear you talk about lower extremities. So you've got these new products, Pangea, LIFEPAK, tons of runway there. Are there things coming down the pike on the organic side in those categories that we should maybe start thinking about? I know you don't like to show your cards too early, but are there things coming down the pike there that can help those big markets? Or do you need to go inorganic to be more successful there? Thanks. Jason Beach : Hey, Matt, this is Jason. I'll start with maybe make a quick comment on neurovascular and then I'll turn it over to Kevin for foot and ankle. But to your point on neurovascular, I'll tell you, globally, we were pleased with the business overall. I think Glenn made a comment in the prepared remarks around a little bit of a supply hiccup, I'll say, as it relates to business in the US. July is actually off to a really nice start. So we feel much better about that. I think you also know that the ischemic business, specifically in the US, continues to be quite competitive. We are making adjustments in the salesforce to address that and better serve our customers. But overall, still feel good about the market. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. And as you talk about foot and ankle, if you recall, since we did the Wright Medical acquisition, foot and ankle has been a really good grower for us. Growing kind of high single digits, low double-digits. I would tell you this year, the foot and ankle market has been softer. You saw that in the first quarter, not just with us, but with the standalone foot and ankle companies that continued in the second quarter, where we're seeing the market being softer than we have seen in the past. So the big trauma number that we put up was really driven by upper extremities, which continues to be a freight train of growth, and now core trauma, which had a fabulous second quarter. But in foot and ankle, it's not that we need any kind of inorganic products. We have great product pipeline that's organic, including Footprint, which is pre planning software for total ankle replacement. And we've launched a number of products for forefoot procedures at the end of last year and into this year. So it's really more about the market. The market's gone a bit quiet. This has happened in the past in foot and ankle. We've been in the business a long time where you've had a quarter to where the market slows down. The patients haven't gone anywhere. They'll come back. And so it is kind of a little bit more semi elective. So we're going to watch the market closely. We'll give you an update next quarter on that. But overall, the trauma and extremities business is a terrific business for our company. And we have a slight slowdown in the foot and ankle area now for two quarters. But the overall growth of the business is still terrific. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Shagun Singh Chadha : Great. Thank you so much. So, Kevin, you have a new robotic platform in the US market with OR integration capabilities. I was just wondering, what are you seeing or hearing in the market currently? What impact do you expect it to have? And I guess, more importantly, I'm just trying to understand what efforts you have in place to better drive OR integration with your products longer term. And then I have a follow up. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Listen, if you look at our portfolio, the new entrants that we're seeing, whether it's OR integration, whether it's new robots, we're really not seeing it having much of an impact at all on our business. We have great technology that's meeting the needs of what our customers want. And if you can see the type of growth we continue to post and the guidance that we're providing and what we see for future growth, we're not really concerned about what we're seeing. We like our chances. We believe we're on the right path with our technologies. There really isn't anything out there, at least right now, that is a cause for major concern for us to maintain our strong and high growth organic profile. Shagun Singh Chadha : Got it. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on one of the adjacencies you previously called out that is of interest to you, which is neuromodulation. And you said including sleep apnea as an adjacency. So could you just share your thoughts there? And is that something that makes sense for you to have in house, given the ENT call point? Thank you for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. This kind of relates back to the soft tissue question, right, which is, do we need to be in this phase? No, we don't need to be in neuromodulation. There are a lot of electrical treatments that I think are fascinating, whether it's deep brain stem, peripheral nerve stem, spinal cord stem, and obviously related to sleep apnea. So I do believe that's going to be part of the future. I do believe Stryker one day will be in the neuromodulation space. I really can't predict which, where will enter first and how we'll grow from there. But it is a space that's appealing to us. But again, we have to make sure that we can win in the market if we're going to spend money and buy a company that we can deliver strong value for our investors with those acquisitions. And so we're going to be careful and thoughtful like we always are. But that is a space that continues to be of interest. And we're -- stay tuned. Shagun Singh Chadha : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So first, congrats, obviously. And I, Kevin, love the bullish posture on sort of sustainability of growth in some of your end markets like orthopaedics. And I think the perception was maybe the first quarter, maybe the first half wasn't as strong as folks maybe came into the year thinking. And I mean, when you talk about mid single digits, is it as simple as saying, look at last year's comps and you start seeing that mid single digit number play out? Or what gives you the confidence that whether it's backlog or something else, that you're going to be able to sustain this, as you said, into sometime early next year and I have one follow up. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. It's really our insight in the market, right? Talking to surgeons, looking at their surgery schedules and seeing how far they're booked out, that is a very good indicator for us. And over the years we've built sort of our internal models that can kind of project that. Now it's hard to go out past six, seven, eight, nine months, then it gets a little murkier. But we have pretty good visibility and right now, we see the market as robust and healthy. And, of course, we love our position. And as you have seen, the demand for Mako would not be this strong if you didn't have surgeons that are really excited about doing all of these procedures. And I think I mentioned earlier, July is off to a very strong start. It's obviously only one month, but strong month of volume. And then looking at the surgery schedules that we survey and talk to surgeons and actually gather data on, we're feeling bullish about the market. Matthew Miksic : That's super helpful and a great point on Mako. And thinking internationally, your comments on Mako and the fact that you're starting to get traction, you're starting to -- I guess it sounds like taking share the same way in intermediate years of Mako launch in the US. If you could talk about other areas of strength internationally, because it was sort of a notable lift some of your core markets. And is there a pull through effect? Any other drivers you can see that might be sustainable there on the international side? And thanks so much for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Great question there on international. What we're seeing, Matt, is there are two tips of the spear in international. One is Mako and the other is our cameras, the 1788. So whenever we sell cameras and towers and when we sell Mako, it does create a pull through of other Stryker business. And we're seeing that in multiple countries. And Mako took a little longer to move, but now it's really starting to take off. Because our market shares are actually a little bit lower internationally, as we get Makos placed more of that business actually is coming from competitive accounts than they were in the United States. But we have discovered that those are the two really important platforms. And as we sell more cameras and as we sell more Makos, it lifts the entire Stryker portfolio. And so were laser focused on those two businesses as the tips of the spear. But we've also really done a good job. It took us a while, as you know, to really get great leadership and better connection between our divisions and international, getting international financials into the bonus plans of our US division leaders. That's been a series of, I'll call them small steps that have really made us a much more global company. And so we've had, I think five years now in a row where international growth has been at or above the US growth. I know the first half of the year international is a little bit behind, but we expect international to accelerate in the second half of the year and will be at or above the US for the full year once again. And that should continue for another many five, 10 years just to make up for lost time as we gain the same kind of market shares that we enjoy in the US, in many other countries around the world. Matthew Miksic : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : Thank you. Evening, guys. Kevin, I wanted to ask you about China. Some mixed commentary during the quarter so far. You mentioned it as a positive. Can you talk about the environment overall from where you guys sit, from a macro perspective and just an operating environment perspective? Jason Beach : Yeah. Steve, it's Jason. I'll take a swing at this and Kevin can jump in if he wants anything additional. But I would tell you, as you think about China in the quarter, good growth for us in China. I would say less impact from VBP than maybe we originally anticipated. So I think from a VBP standpoint, that environment is starting to stabilize and turning to growth for us. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. And just as a reminder, it's a pretty small portion of Stryker's overall business. Just so keep that in mind. When you see the growth rates, they can be a little bit more volatile, both positive and negative. Just given that it's small, the base is very small for us. Look, it's an important market with a large population. We're not going to move away from China. But it's been a challenge the last couple of years and I think the worst is over. And now hopefully we'll get into a more sustained positive profile like we saw last quarter. Steve Lichtman : Appreciate it. And then just a follow up on free cash flow. So it's trailed a bit here, first half of this year versus last. You mentioned some working capital movement. Any thoughts you could provide on sort of full year free cash flow outlook or improvements on that working capital moving parts that you talked about? Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. I think, first of all, we still have that target out there, 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion. We don't think any differently about that, given our performance year-to-date this year. I think kind of what you're seeing in the first half of this year are some working capital differences year-over-year from last year. Some of those having to do with. We picked back up M&A, so we're seeing a little bit more of integration flow through. We also are seeing inventory changes just related to higher sales. That naturally happens. Same thing with accounts receivable. And then lastly, we have timing of some transition tax payments that fell into this first half of the year that are, say, larger payments than what we normally would expect. And so that also impacted our cash flow in the first half of this year. For the back half of this year, I feel like we'll see what we normally see seasonally. A lot of pick up in our free cash flow conversion in Q3 and then, honestly on into Q4. And a lot of that has to do with just the flow of earnings is much higher in Q3, Q4. So that really impacts our cash flow performance. It also brings down inventory. And then we'll work to keep AR in line. So we'll still target between 70% and 80% free cash flow and we haven't backed away from that. Steve Lichtman : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies for the audio issues in our end. Kevin, maybe one on LP 35, maybe talk about the launch. I think in the past it mentioned some capacity constraints. Did it contribute in 2Q, are we at full launch mode right now? Kevin Lobo : Well, we've already started taking orders. Let me put it to you that way. And we have the ability to ramp production pretty fast. So this is not like a implant launch. Like, if you think about Pangea, you have to make sets of implants, you have to make sets of instruments. This is an assembly operation, so we'll be able to scale this pretty quickly. And so I wouldn't look at this as being capacity constraint. The only constraint is obviously getting out there, having customers see it, putting it in their budgets, ordering it, and then our ability to meet the demand will be faster out of the gates with LP 35 than we would be for any kind of an implant launch. So don't think about capacity as a major concern. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And maybe one on guidance here. The overall organic dollar revenues, it seemed in line versus Street, but guidance was raised. Just talk about. I think you mentioned about July being strong. Looks like there were some one-off items impacting in 2Q. So talk about the visibility and the confidence in the guide raise for back half. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Listen, we don't raise guidance without having pretty good confidence. And you saw we raised after Q1, we raised again after Q2. We have very good visibility into our capital, and we have a very significant backlog of capital which we know we're going to ship. So that gives us a lot of confidence, and then how you feel about the procedures. And that's the other part of it. And again, we have pretty good visibility into the procedure. So at least for six months, we've tended to be pretty good at predicting six months. Predicting beyond six months, that's a little harder. But we feel very confident that we're going to deliver this raised guidance. And don't be afraid if we scare 10% again, that'll be the third year in a row of being hovering around that number or being above that number. And so we have a lot of headwinds. I think I enumerated those earlier in the call, and those tailwinds are really going to help us. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow on. I think it was Travis's question before asking about some of the growth drivers next year. You called out Pangea and the Defib as being big incremental drivers. Could you help us think about the shape of those launches or the contributions in 2025, any guideposts that you would give us in thinking about how they could roll in and contribute the opportunity sets? And I guess how long you view those as growth drivers in '25 and beyond? Kevin Lobo : Listen, they're both very significant contributors to future growth. I would say LP 35 will be more rapid. So you'll see a pickup in the second half of this year, a big year next year, a big year the year after. But these products last a long time, and so some people who are buying these defibs will hold them for seven, eight years. So it'll have a long sort of tailwind, but it'll be spiky in the first sort of two years, two to three years, you'll see pretty meaningful growth out of LIFEPAK 35. Pangea is a little different, so it won't be fully launched until the second half of next year. It takes multiple quarters to be able to build all of the instrument sets and the implant sets, but these implant launches will last a long, long, long time. It'll provide a more -- let's say a little bit more moderate but sustained and consistent tailwind to our core trauma business and makes us comprehensive with a fabulous nailing systems as well as plating. So we will be an absolute leader in the trauma and extremities business and super excited. But that doesn't also -- it doesn't stop at those two products, right? You still have the Mako Spine coming the Copilot coming, the Mako Shoulder coming. 1788 is still -- I mean we're still getting new indications with new fluorophores to be able to light up cancer. We have that for lung, but were going to get that for bladder and as well as ovarian cancer. That opens up new markets and new opportunities as well. So this new product cadence that were in right now, these products are multiyear. They don't just provide a small one year benefit. And many of these products haven't yet been launched internationally. So we've launched these in the US and maybe in some markets Europe because of UMDR. These products we're going to be talking about as new products a year or two from now. They haven't even been launched, right? So that's going to provide that international tailwind for many years to come. So there's a lot to be excited about in terms of the product innovation cycle and we're hitting the mark. That's another reason for the raise, right? So you launch a new product, you see the customer feedback, you realize you have a winner and Pangea is a winner and LIFEPAK 35 is a winner. And then you can lean forward and we already know with the orders that are coming in already that these are going to be winners and they're going to be multiyear winners. Matthew Taylor : Thanks, Kevin. Could I ask a follow up on just the margins? We talked a lot about the margin phasing this year, Glenn, and these contributions in the second half. And I guess, I was just wondering if you could make some high-level comments on how the shape of the margin progression would look in 2025. You think it's going to be similar where there's more expansion in the second half than the first half? Or would it be different because of the progress you're making this year? Jason Beach : Hey Matt, it's Jason. I'll jump in here. As we think about 2025, obviously we'll talk more about that in January. Certainly, you can expect us to deliver on the 100 basis point of op margin expansion next year, but in terms of how that shape will look, we'll give you more information when we get to January. Matthew Taylor : All right. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. JoshuaJennings: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on organic revenue growth being raised quarter. We're looking for just some commentary. Kevin and team on just on inventory surgical center channel in the United States. Our understanding is that just the infrastructure, the number of ortho, ASCs or the bottleneck in terms of the pace of migration for total joints into that setting. Anything you can share just in the first half in terms of infrastructure build out, was it impacted by interest rates and any change in the outlook in this migration pace over the next couple of years for total joints? And then lastly, sorry for the three-part question, just the pricing commentary for the company. Should we hold that for the ASC business as well? Or was there more pricing pressure or less pricing pressure, or more pricing improvement or less pricing improvement in that ASC channel? Thanks for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Okay. I hope I get all parts of this question in my answer, but let me start by saying that the pricing that we're seeing, ASC versus hospital, there really isn't any difference. Our pricing is very consistent across the different channels where we sell. So that's the first part. The second part is, I'd say the ASC continues to be a positive trend that you're going to see and it's not going to slow down anytime soon. Even with interest rates being high, hospitals are finding a ways to get to get their ASCs built and constructed and we've seen continued, I would call it steady growth. This second quarter finished with the highest percent of knees and hips done in ambulatory surgery centers. We're not going to give the exact number. Perhaps at the end of the year we'll give you the exact percentage, but it continues to climb. Our percent of hips and knees done in the ASC every quarter continues to move up. And that happened in the first quarter. It happened again in the second quarter. And if we look at our ASC, our growth in ASCs, it is accretive to Stryker's overall growth. So we are growing at a high rate in ASCs. This trend we believe favors us given the breadth of our offering in orthopedic ASCs. And so we welcome this shift and so far so good. JoshuaJennings: Great. Thanks for that. And then just a follow up. I know you've kind of given in Stryker's outlook for multiple ortho categories or segments. I was hoping you could do the same for the US spine industry. And just your outlook there. Health of the market and you got Q Guidance and Copilot update of approval today. We're launching Mako's Spine. Do you think Stryker Spine is kind of maintaining share in the first half of 2024 and can gain share with these enabling technology ads? Where is Stryker Spine gaining share currently in the US market? Thanks a lot. Jason Beach : Yeah. Josh, this is Jason. I'll take this one. I would say just as you think about specifically the second quarter, we'd say we have had a solid quarter in spine led by interventional spine. And as we think to the future, we've certainly talked about Copilot and Mako Spine and how that will help us in the spine market. And so really nothing additional to add there in terms of how we think about the future. JoshuaJennings: Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. Just a follow up question on the ASC dynamic. Kevin, just curious about how you're seeing -- if there's any difference you're seeing from a market share perspective in the ASC versus outside the ASC for your, both the robot and the hip and knee implant. And I asked this question, because I think one of the advantages of Stryker is just the breast of the product offering in the ASC. So just want to sanity check that with you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, Danielle, what I'd say is that if there is a big renovation or new construction, we do extremely well. So I don't want to speak on behalf of all ASCs, right? If it's already an ASC, that's an orthopedic ASC, and there's entrenched surgeons that are using competitive products, that's a little harder for us to displace. But if they're doing a big renovation or if they're doing new construction, we have a fantastic offense that wins at very, very high rates. And that's been one of the engines that's caused this tremendous growth for us in the ASC and why we continue to believe that that's the area where we're going to be laser focused. That's the area where we are winning today, and that's the area we're going to continue to win in the future. So it's not necessarily all ASCs. Danielle Antalffy : Got it. Kevin Lobo : Definitely that segment. And there's continued -- there's new construction going on all the time. Danielle Antalffy : Yeah. Got it. Understood. Thank you so much for that. And then just to follow up on that, if we fast forward, so the shift has been happening over the last few years now. I mean, where do you think this settles out? If you're talking about hips, knees and extremities and percentage of procedures being done at the ASC versus in the hospital in, say, five years. Thanks so much. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Look, I don't have a crystal ball. It's going to go higher. There's just -- this is an undeniable trend. Surgeons love it. They get a piece of the action in terms of their ownership interest. Patients love it because they don't have to worry about parking. It's close to their home. Everybody's happy. There are no sick people. So it's just good for the healthcare system. And so it's just going to continue to increase. What's the upper limit? I don't know, but I would tell you I feel differently about this than I did five years ago. I thought it would grow. It is growing at a faster rate than I thought. We are even seeing total ankles done in ASCs, obviously, shoulder replacements done in ASCs, even lumbar spine, which I didn't think. I thought cervical, sure, didn't think I'd see lumbar. So you're just going to see more and more procedures being done. Obviously, you're not going to see revisions and very high acuity scoliosis, those types of procedures. But I think it's frankly exceeded our expectations internally, and I think that's going to continue. The rate limiting factor is just being able to construct these ASCs and obviously have the financing and the capital and the ownership structure sorted out between the hospital and the surgeons. That's the rate limiting factor. But I just see this continuing to grow and I don't really see sort of where this stops. It's just going to keep growing. Five years from now, what will it be? It's in the 10% to 15% range now. It'll cross 15% next year and then it could go to 30%, 40%. It could. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yeah, thanks. So good to hear about the momentum in the international business. I wanted to ask about what that would mean to your margins. If you see that business continue to outpace the US, how does it compare from the gross and operating margin perspective? Is this something that could be a headwind to your margins? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Hi, Mike. As we look at international, a couple of things. Keep in mind, we don't have R&D expense in our international sort of numbers as we look at sort of performance of their margins. So you have that performance. We also -- it can vary market by market. I mean, I think in some of these more developed markets, we see good price performance and good operating margins. Sometimes in more sort of emerging markets, we will see a slight headwind relative to sort of what we're realizing from a pricing standpoint in those markets. I would tell you that. I think that as we look out over the long-term, though, we obviously are cognizant of the fact of what international sales and how that will contribute to our overall margin profile. And so we have planned for the kind of infrastructure needs and the kind of other saving needs that we need to do to make sure that we drive this consistent margin and drive a consistent 30 basis points plus margin performance once we get past this 200 basis points increase that we're looking at. So there will be some. But overall, I think that as we look at it, we're not seeing that it's going to be a headwind that we will not overcome. Michael Matson : Okay. Got it. And then just, I think you did do one small acquisition, the Artelon company, I believe is in the extremities area. Can you just comment on that and kind of how it fits or what it brings to the table? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Listen, this is a gap filler for us in soft tissue fixation that's used in foot and ankle procedures by sports medicine doctors, as well as foot and ankle doctors. It's an elegant, terrific product. We're really excited about it. Both of our sports business unit and foot and ankle business units, both teams are going to be selling this product based on the surgeon call point that they have. So really, really terrific product. We've been tracking the company for quite some time, and we're not going to get into details of how much. It's not a big product, but it's a really great gap filler that, again, our sports business has, as you know, been growing at very high rates for many years now, and this fits in with them. It also fits in with our foot and ankle business. Michael Matson : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Caitlin Cronin : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just jumping off of the spine question earlier. The interventional spine business had a good quarter this quarter and last quarter as well. Can you talk about what makes up that business for you and why you think you're seeing strength there? Is this more of a market tailwind that you're capitalizing on or specifically Stryker. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Listen, this IVS business of ours has been a really terrific business, if you think about what is in that business. We bought these curved balloons from the CareFusion a while back. We acquired the spine jack product. We've also developed some terrific internal products. We launched the OptaBlate Blade product. So we have the pain docs and we have the oncology. So two different call points within our IVS business, and a pretty robust portfolio. And just outstanding commercial execution has been really a terrific engine of growth for us. And it's an area we like. And we continue to believe we're going to expand in this area at some point in the future. We're certainly going to be adding salespeople, as we have been doing, because we have the product portfolio, partially organic and partially inorganic. Caitlin Cronin : Great. And you maintained expectations to launch Mako Shoulder later this year. What are you seeing in the market with Zimmer's early launch of its shoulder robotic application? And any updates you're seeing in the use case of shoulder robotics? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. No, no feedback yet competitively, so it's not really had any impact thus far. It's early, so there really isn't anything to share right now. We'll -- once we learn something, we'll let you know. But we like our chances. We like our chances with our Mako Shoulder. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me and I'll be quick. Just a neurovas. I thought I heard you mention a supply issue within flow diverters. I'm just wondering, when will this resolve? And maybe you can just give us a broader view on the health of the supply chain, whether it be input costs, freight costs, et cetera. Jason Beach : Hey, Jason. It's Jason. I would say just overall, Stryker, I would say supply's in quite good shape. Do we see spotty issues like I mentioned, relative to neurovascular? Yes. We saw a little bit of a supply disruption as it relates to our medical business outside of the United States as well. But these things are resolving themselves. July for neurovascular, off to a good start. And as it relates to medical, I think you should expect robust growth in the second half as well. So nothing from a supply standpoint is a concern for us as we move forward. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's helpful. And just quickly, I wanted to follow up on the foot and ankle commentary. I'm just wondering why you think the market is soft and just historically, what drives the rebound out of these lulls. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Look, there's a lot of different dynamics, and one of the dynamics is OR time, it's getting prioritized for other procedures. So you have surgeons that actually are getting squeezed out of operating because the ORs are being used for, let's call them more higher value, higher revenue producing procedures. That's one part. You've got these copays that people have to pay. And sometimes they're just a little bit squeezed and that can cause a bit of a delay. So there are multiple factors at play. And like I say, we've seen this happen in the past. I don't know how long it'll last. It caught us a little bit by surprise, to be honest. But we've liked the business that we have. We like the portfolio that we have. And these patients aren't -- they're going to -- these bunions don't heal themselves, so they're going to come back to the market, and I think we're going to be well-positioned when that happens. But yes, it has been two quarters in a row. We'll let you know how Q3 goes. But again, it's not going to be a problem for our trauma and extremities business. It will continue to have very high growth regardless of what happens in this market. Jayson Bedford : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Andrew Ranieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for Kevin, but I think you also mentioned that you did another small acquisition of MOLLI. But just curious if you can kind of detail a bit more about that deal. And I'd imagine it would be fairly small, but I'm kind of curious to hear about how this kind of informs your overall breast strategy in the market, how you might be able to bundle this with 1788 and some of the other maybe prior deals you've done in the breast space. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin Lobo : Yeah. Thanks. Women's health and urology has been an area of interest for us. And the endoscopy division is pretty excited about MOLLI to be able to localize the lesions that need to be removed in surgery. And for surgery, as you mentioned, we have NOVADAQ the Exoscope from the Invuity acquisition, we have the PhotonBlade. We can do single stage procedures because you can assess the health of the tissue and then having the localization. And we already have the rep there. They're already -- so this is a perfect, classic tuck-in for Stryker. The reps are there, they're in the procedure. And this product, even though it's not a big revenue producer, at least now. It is elegant, it is easy to use, it is a terrific product. And so we've watched all the other products in this space. This is the one we've. We've had our eye on and we are really excited to have that as part of Stryker. And it will enable us to be a bigger force in breast care. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thanks, and good afternoon. Kevin, I wanted to follow up on a comment you just made about capacity in the hospital and the prioritization around certainly whether it's acuity cases or other dynamics influencing how hospitals are managing capacity constraints in their surgical suites. How should we think about that as a potential long-term or even intermediate term tailwind to your MedSurg business? Kevin Lobo : Yeah. It's a good question. And certainly, the demand for capital is very high. There is construction, as you know, if hospitals are being constructed, ASCs are being constructed, patients are getting great outcomes. I think the ASC is a contributor. People -- they go home the same day, they can't believe they can get back to playing their sport of choice so quickly. Word is spreading. And so I think this is one of those reasons where you're seeing the demand increasing. And as the operating room spill up, they're looking for outlets to be able to do more and more procedures. So I do believe that that's contributing to this elevated procedures. And for our MedSurg business, a lot of our small capital that has to be replaced. And that's probably why we're experiencing the kind of high growth. You look at instruments, you look at power tools, very, very high growth and a promising outlook going forward. I hope this continues. We see it continuing at least through the end of this year and obviously, we'll let you know what we think about guidance for next year in January. David Roman : Got it. And then maybe just a follow up for Glenn and maybe Jason. Just on the P&L, I think on the last call, you had laid out a path that more of the gross margin on a go forward basis would come -- sorry -- more the operating margin expansion would come from gross margins versus OpEx. I think you're pointing to the back half of the year, reflecting more SG&A leverage. How should we think about just the interplay between different line items of the P&L with MedSurg becoming a larger percentage of total and how we think about in the context of the different drivers for operating margin expansion? Glenn Boehnlein : Yeah. Hi, David. I think, though, as I think back to how we have characterized it, if you think about what we did in 2023 that had more gross margin expansion and op margin. And we've always said that 2024 would lean more to sort of SG&A and leverage of op expenses. So I don't think we've really sort of changed sort of how we think about how the year is going to play out for op margin expansion. So I do think that we are bullish on opportunities in gross margin, but a lot of those are things you do this year that are going to benefit us in 2025. On SG&A, that's more near-term things that we have that we budgeted for and planned for that I think actually will allow us to give us a lot of confidence to say that we will get to that 100 basis points of op margin expansion. David Roman : Got it. Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Glenn Boehnlein : Sure. Operator : There are no further questions. I'll turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Kevin Lobo : Thank you for all your questions and for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in October. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the second quarter 2024 Stryker earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Stryker Earning Call. My name is Luke, and I'm your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO, and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. In the third quarter we delivered robust organic sales growth of 11.5%. Our performance included strong double-digit growth within MedSurg and Neurotechnology and nearly 10% growth in Orthopedics and Spine. This broad performance reflects healthy demand across our diverse product portfolio and our team's steadfast commercial execution. Our strong results reflect double-digit organic growth from our medical, neuro cranial endoscopy, trauma and extremities, hips and knees businesses. Our growth was well balanced between the U.S. and International with both rising double digits organically. All international regions showed strength in the quarter and we continue to see international markets as key catalysts for our long-term growth. We stayed active on the M&A front, completing several deals in the quarter. In September we acquired Care.ai, which strengthens our healthcare, IT and wirelessly connected offerings. We also acquired NICO Corporation which enables minimally invasive surgery for tumor and intracerebral hemorrhage procedures. Lastly, we acquired Vertos Medical which provides minimally invasive solution for treating chronic lower back pain caused by spinal stenosis and enhances our pain management portfolio. We remain committed to complementing our growth through acquisitions and have a strong deal pipeline and healthy financial capacity. We delivered adjusted quarterly EPS of $2.87 reflecting 16.7% growth compared to the third quarter of 2023. Finally, we are narrowing our expectations for 2024 to the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges and now anticipate full year organic sales growth of 9.5% to 10% and adjusted EPS of $12 to $12.10. Our updated guidance reflects the continued momentum from product innovation, healthy procedure volumes and terrific commercial execution across the globe. We are on track and remain committed to our goal of 200 basis points of margin expansion by the end of 2025. This includes 100 basis points of margin expansion this year while offsetting dilution from an M&A. I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, capital demand and recent acquisitions. Procedural volumes remained healthy in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and underscored by continued adoption of robotic assisted surgery. We continue to expect strength in procedural demand through the end of the year. Demand for our capital products was strong in the quarter with an elevated backlog across our capital businesses. Patient and customer interest in Mako was highlighted by record Q3 installations both worldwide and in the U.S. with high utilization rates across the globe. We expect the sustained momentum from installations and utilization will continue to drive growth in our hips and knees businesses. Our latest platform launches continue to experience success in the marketplace. Our Pangea Plating system is progressing well with a full launch expected in the U.S. by the second half of 2025. Our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor has a strong order book and sales have begun to ramp. Additionally, robust adoption of our 1788 visualization platform continues to contribute to the growth we are seeing in our endoscopy business. Lastly, we've begun early cases with both our Spine Guidance 5 software featuring Copilot and our Mako Spine Robot. As with prior product launches, these spine offerings will be on a limited market release for some time as we refine training protocols. Mako Shoulder is on track to launch at the end of the year. We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons who have seen these products. From an inorganic perspective, our 2024 acquisitions reinforce our dedication to improving outcomes across the continuum-of-care and are commitment to meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Year-to-date we have closed seven acquisitions while investing approximately 1.6 billion to complete. In 2025, we expect these acquisitions will contribute approximately 300 million to sales. With that I will turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks Jason. Today I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter compared to 9.2% in the third quarter of 2023. This quarter had one more selling day than 2023. We had a 1.2% favorable impact from pricing. We continue to see a positive trend in our pricing initiatives both in the U.S. and international markets and both with our MedSurg and Neurotech and Orthopedic and Spine segment each contributing positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign Currency had a 0.1% unfavorable impact on sales. In the U.S. organic sales growth was 11.4%. International organic sales growth was 11.7% driven by positive sales momentum across our international markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.87 in the quarter was up 16.7% from 2023 driven by strong sales growth and continued margin expansion. Foreign currency exchange translation had minimal impact on our adjusted EPS for the quarter. Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 12.9% and organic sales growth of 12.7% which included 13.2% of U.S. organic growth and 11.2% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.9% led by strong double-digit growth in the surgical technologies business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by Waste Management, Smoke Evacuation, Tourniquet cuffs, Steri-Shield and Power tools. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 10.9% with strong growth across all businesses. Growth in the quarter was fueled by robust demand for our OR infrastructure and renovations and the continued success of the 1788 platform and sports medicine shoulder products. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 18.5% driven by strong performances across all of its businesses, acute care, sage and emergency care. From a product perspective the medical business was led by strong sales growth in beds and stretchers, sage products, transport capital and defibrillators. The order pipeline for LIFEPAK 35 is robust and continues to drive excitement in the market. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 1.5% which reflects solid performance in our core hemorrhagic products offset by recovering performance in our flow diverting stent products due to supply chain issues earlier in the year and competitive pressures in our ischemic business. And finally, Neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 16.1% led by strong growth in our bone mill, high speed drills, bipolar forceps and cranial maxillofacial products. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 11.2% led by double-digit organic growth in our endoscopy and medical businesses. Geographically this included strong performances in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and most of our emerging markets. Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 10.8% and organic sales growth of 9.7% which included organic growth of 8.6% in the U.S. and 12.3% internationally. Our U.S. knee business grew 8.4% organically reflecting our market leading position in robotic assisted knee procedures and the continued strength of our installed Mako base as well as continued momentum in new Mako installations. Our U.S. Hip business grew 10.9% organically driven by the continued success of our insignia, hip stem and momentum from our Mako robotic hip platform. Our U.S. trauma and extremities business grew 11.8% organically with double-digit sales growth across our core trauma, upper extremities and biologics businesses. Our U.S. spine business grew 2.4% organically, led by performance in our interventional spine business. Our U.S. other Ortho business had a slight decline organically of 0.6% driven by seasonal Mako deal mix and a decline in bone cement. Internationally, orthopedics and spine grew 12.3% organically, including strong performances in South Korea, Japan, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 64.5% was 20 basis points unfavorable from third quarter of 2023. This variance resulted primarily from mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 6.6% of sales, which was 20 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 33.2% of sales, which was 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to natural expense leverage combined with spending discipline somewhat offset by investments to support growth. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.7% of sales, which was 130 basis points favorable to third quarter of 2023. Net adjusted other income and expense of $42 million for the quarter was $19 million lower than 2023, driven by favorable interest income on our invested cash balances. We expect our full year net adjusted income and expense to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million. The third quarter of 2024 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.8%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 15%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $4.7 billion of cash marketable securities and short term investments. Total debt was approximately $15.5 billion. This debt includes approximately $3 billion from our bond offerings in September 2024, a portion of which will be used to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the fourth quarter. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.3 billion, an increase of $120 million from 2023 driven mainly by higher earnings and improvements in inventory and accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable from sales timing and other expense timing. Based on our year-to-date performance, sustained demand for our capital products, and healthy procedural volumes, we now expect full year 2024 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. This includes a favorable pricing impact of 0.5% to 1%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate full year sales will be slightly unfavorably impacted and adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10, both of which are reflected in our guidance. With a strong first nine months of the year, strong Q4 sales and operating margin momentum, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $12 to $12.10. And now I will open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great third quarter here. Kevin, I wanted to ask Medical really stands out. 60% is now of sales is now in that MedSurg, Neurotech and Medical grew closer to 20% this quarter. You called out the LIFEPAK had really good orders but also beds and stretchers as well. There's a lot in that medical line item so just wanted to see what's going on there, how much is one time versus sustainable? And then I have a follow up. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks Robby. We love our medical business. If you look over the past five years, it's probably been our highest growing division pretty consistently. Now from quarter-to-quarter it does move around a little bit given the capital equipment nature of the business, but it's not unusual for us to post an 18% growth. If you just look back over the past, let's say 8 quarters to 12 quarters. Why? Because we have tremendous innovation and momentum behind ProCuity, Wireless Stretchers, LIFEPAK 35. The Sage business is just on fire and has been performing extremely well. You have Vocera in the mix and more recently we've acquired care.ai, ofcourse nothing really showing for that this quarter, but all of this is just feeding an engine of momentum. Great leadership team, great talent and culture and so I don't see medical slowing down anytime soon. Will we have 18s every quarter? Probably not, but you can expect double digit growth through the medical division for a long time to come. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe just to follow up, fourth quarter implied guide with the updated guidance is still a really good number, but it looks to be just a bit below trend at least on sales versus year-to-date. Is there, is there any impact that we're seeing from the hurricanes or any other disruptions we should be thinking about in fourth quarter? Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes, no, we don't, we're not really counting on any disruption from the hurricanes. Sure there was a little bit here or there, but we expect those procedures to be made up in the quarter. So no effect whatsoever to do with weather. I think it's a reasonable guide. We moved it up, but clearly we are hoping and aiming to finish at the high end of that guide, closer to the 10% which you've seen us do in the past couple of years. So that's where we're aiming. But we have big comps. Right. Last year's fourth quarter was 11.5%. So we're running against big numbers. But, but certainly we don't, we don't have anything negative in terms of the vibes that we're feeling on the business. The momentum is good, just running against big numbers and, and we've moved it up what we feel is a reasonable amount and we're going to shoot for the high end. So it's certainly possible that we'll have a 10% organic growth quarter in Q4 Robert Marcus : Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Okay, our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a really nice quarter here. So, Kevin, I wanted to ask a little bit of about 2025. You're guiding to 9.5% to 10% this year. How sustainable is the momentum in the top line growth we're seeing? And what are the drivers of the 100 basis points of margin expansion that you called out on the call? And Glenn, given the recent refinement, I think should we be thinking about below the line for interest expense differently next year? And I have one follow-up. Thanks. Jason Beach : Hey, Larry, it's Jason. I'll jump in here and handle the 2025 piece and then maybe Glenn can speak to the 100 basis points of OP margin expansion as we land this year. As we think about next year, we'll talk more obviously about that in January. The one thing I would say, we're certainly happy with the momentum in the business. We stand very committed to the 100 basis points of op margin expansion again next year. But beyond that we'll certainly get into in January. Kevin Lobo : Yes. And then just as it relates to op margin. Lawrence Biegelsen : Go ahead. Sorry. No, no, no. My apologies. Please go ahead. Kevin Lobo : Okay. Yes, I just wanted to give you some comments and color around the sort of 100 basis point op margin expansion that we're fully expecting to deliver on this year and the 100 basis point op margin expansion that will carry over into next year as well. First of all, if you look at our results for Q3, we had great momentum and we feel like that momentum definitely will carry forward into Q4. Just as a reminder, during the year, and honestly, even last year, we started several initiatives to drive this improved leverage. These included, looking at low cost manufacturing sites, looking at vendors to offset a lot of the inflationary increases that came across post pandemic. Moving down to operating expenses, our shared services footprint continues to expand. We continue to push more transactional work into those shared services. We are also seeing good results from sort of IT system rationalization and that means we're putting more and more of our businesses on similar systems and it's just a lot inexpensive to operate that way. And then of course, coming off of sort of this hybrid work environment, we also are focusing on office space rationalization. So I have all of that that is ongoing and in process and starting to really deliver. I also am seeing strong price performance like you just heard. And there's an ongoing focus there. And then lastly, Q4 is our biggest sales quarter of the year. And the amount of natural leverage that will drive because sales are going to go up and our fixed costs are not growing, we'll create a lot of natural leverage that will benefit from. And then the last point I would make, and we talk about this internally in Stryker all the time, the target that we're reaching for is not something we haven't seen before. We've been there. We know what that kind of leverage looks like. So nobody at Stryker doesn't know how that feels or how do you deliver on that. And so there's a lot of confidence and you heard it from Kevin that we'll deliver the 100 basis points this year and we'll deliver it next year. Lawrence Biegelsen : That's super helpful. Just for my follow up, the hip growth was really strong in Q3, especially outside of the U.S. what drove that and how should we think about the sustainability? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks, Larry. We're super excited with the hip performance. It's not just a one quarter thing. Of course. This quarter did pop a little bit more, but the Insignia launch is now starting to spread around the world. We were kind of constrained on supply and had to delay some of the international markets. They are now starting to receive that product and driving that. In addition, we have Mako Hip really starting to take off. We've got a bit of additional reimbursement in Japan. And then if you look down organically, obviously the growth was double digits. It looks even bigger because of the SERF acquisition. So there is an inorganic component to the hip business in Europe. That acquisition is off to a great start ahead of the deal model. So we're really excited about that European acquisition, primarily in France, but also in other European markets. But overall, we're delighted with the progress of our hip business, not just internationally, but also in the U.S. I think we posted a very strong number in the U.S. as well. So our hip business has tremendous momentum. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Hi, can you hear me okay? Kevin Lobo : Yes, we can. Yes. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent. Very nice quarter. One of the things that I think that investors struggle with is when they see this kind of growth in ortho, an impression that this is not sustainable and either at some level of pent up demand and volume or pricing that is moved positively, that may not remain positively. Can you please address that? Tell me why it's right or wrong? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Thanks. Joanne, I don't know how many quarters it takes for you to start to believe that it's going to be a good market. This has been going on for some time now, I think obviously potentially long memories. But we've called the market up more than a year ago. We said that we expected this to be an elevated market just based on looking at surgery schedules and the level of activity and the aging demographics and the great outcomes from these procedures. So I said this, I think one or two quarters ago that this feels like we're kind of in a bit of a new normal. And of course no one has a crystal ball. We can't predict exactly how the market will evolve. But all signs and signals are pointing to this being kind of like a new normal, at least for the market growth being no longer low single kind of a mid-single digit growth. And of course we're achieving a higher growth rate just based on our innovation and our sales execution. So to me, I'm not surprised to see these kind of numbers. We're excited about these numbers and maybe I'll ask Glenn to comment a little bit about pricing. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. And Joanne, I think, one of the things that you've seen us deliver on quarter-over-quarter and I think even with orthopedics is just we have a very big focus on these contracts as they're coming up and the negotiations related to those contracts. And we're seeing the results. We're seeing that, okay we're not always getting into positive territory on orthopedics, but we are seeing less negative than we had seen before. And so I don't see that focus going away anytime soon. Joanne Wuensch : Well, as my follow up, can you comment on early feedback for Mako Spine? And thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks Joanne. It's very early, so so far so good. That's all I can say. We just started the cases literally just, in the last week or so. So it is a little bit early to give you more color. Certainly on the next call we'll be able to provide a lot more feedback. But so far in the early stages, it is performing kind of as we expected. We're also excited about Copilot, which is part of that same ecosystem. We've had actually a bit more experience with Copilot, so that launched a little bit ahead of Mako Spine. So what's exciting for me is that, robotics launches typically tend to be delayed. Right. If you just look at the industry at large, it's not always easy to launch a robotic application on time. And, and these two came right on time, right on schedule. And so far we're getting very good feedback. But it's early and it's not going to have a big impact on our sales for a little while because we do want to make sure everything is going as it should. We get the training right, not just for the surgeon, but also for their staff. As we've learned with previous launches, it pays to go a little bit slow at the beginning to make sure you get everything nailed before you really start to scale. But all signs and signals are pointing to this, to these two products being really successful for our spine business. Joanne Wuensch : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Kevin, we have the chance to see the Vocera acquisition, really be integrated into your beds, your stretchers, even some extent, the LIFEPAK 35 products. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of where Stryker's headed from a software versus hardware standpoint. How to think about maybe some of this recurring revenue that you expect to get as you create this ecosystem with Vocera and now maybe carry to some extent and other products and kind of where you're driving the business to versus what we've historically thought of as more traditional Medtech, if you will. I'm just curious your thoughts on that focus. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. Listen, we focus on solving customer problems. That's fundamentally how we think about it. We know our customers, customers very intimately. And we have been evolving as a company. We moved into 3D printing, we moved into robotics, we've moved into digital. We're now moving into workflow and software as a service. So this is not something that's sort of new. It's been a gradual progression over a number of years. But I do see us getting more and more involved in connected services for our customers. And these are all high growth spaces with very good margin profiles. And I think Care.ai is incredibly exciting getting into virtual nursing, which solves a lot of the problems that hospital customers are having around staffing and being able to integrate that with Vocera. So we're not done. I would say we're going to continue to expand both organically with follow on software upgrades because these things you have to have continual upgrade cycles. But also looking at other acquisitions to continue to bolt on to the Vocera and Care.ai solution. We're looking at expanding Vocera into areas like the emergency department of hospitals. So there's a lot more footprint that we can actually extend these technologies into. So to me it's an incredibly exciting platform opportunity for us in the future, these wireless and digital solutions. But just think about it as us continuing to, to look for ways to get into high growth spaces that solve customer problems. And we'll just continue to extend it and expand it. But it's not a shift. We're still very focused on hips and knees and neuro and our other businesses are also, as you see from our results today, are also high growth. And we do that with sometimes traditional methods of producing our products and sometimes getting into new technologies like 3D printing. So do expect more of the same. And this diversification towards MedSurg, it's been going on for a decade and they do have a lot more opportunities for new innovations than you would see in the traditional implant business. So I would expect this diversification story to probably continue going forward. Ryan Zimmerman : Fair enough. And Jason, you made the comment, that you expect procedures to be healthy through year end. You've historically made those comments in kind of a three to six month window. And I know this is trivial and it's kind of a follow up to Joanne's question, but any reason why, early thoughts on in, early 25, we wouldn't result in any type of, similar procedure environment? I mean it seems like it would suggest, even into first quarter 2025 that there wouldn't be some type of slowdown. And again, I know, it's a more near term question. Jason Beach : Yes, no, Ryan, I think what I would say is we don't have any indication that would suggest there's any level of slowdown. And I tell you as a reminder, Kevin made this point as well. If you go back to as far back as our investor day, right. We said we kind of see these markets as mid-single digit growing markets. I think that's how you're going to see kind of this year play out and we're going to perform 200 to 300 basis points above. I don't have any reason to believe as we, as we turn the page and go to January that there'll be some material slowdown. So we, we feel good about how we think we'll end the year and then start off 2025. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Another question I wanted to ask one on LIFEPAK. Any sense for if you could comment on the order backlog compared to kind of typical product backlogs, some of the early feedback. Do you think this is enough for Medical to grow and accelerate the growth rate of Medical next year? And then just wanted to make sure on the installed base, the 100,000 plus, is that a installed base of the market or is that an installed base for Stryker? There's some confusing comments out there. So I wanted to clarify that here. Jason Beach : Hey Travis, it's Jason. First off on the, on the backlog. I'm not going to try to quantify it for LP 35 specifically, but I'll say it's healthy. Right. And there is a ton of excitement in the marketplace here and we certainly think it'll be one of the pieces. As Kevin talks about Medical being a double digit grower. LP 35 is certainly going to play into that. In terms of install base, yes the 100,000 that you reference, that's a good worldwide number for us as we think about that Stryker specifically. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So that just to be clear, that's. That's our installed base. That's right. That's the life back installed base which I think was the root of your question. And given the replacement cycle, you should think of this as a multi-year tailwind for Medical. It's just, it's not a one year, two years. This is going to be three, four, five year tailwind just given the lengthy life cycle of these problems. Travis Steed : Great. And I had a follow up, kind of a two part one for you, Kevin, just how you're thinking about the overall M&A environment and sizable deals later this year, early next year. And Jason, the 300 million you called out on M&A contribution, is that all in organic revenue? Is there any of that flow into organic and curious how fast that piece of revenue is growing. Kevin Lobo : Yes. So thanks. First of all on the question on the organic or inorganic, obviously these deals happened over the course of this year, the seven deals. Right. So we're going to give our guidance for organic sales growth in January and you should assume that roughly half of the sales that were, that we talked about, roughly half of the 300 million, will end up being inorganic next year. The other roughly half will appear in our organic guide for the year. But we wanted to give you a sort of a sense for all of these. They're small tuck-ins for the most part, but actually very exciting for each one of those individual businesses. So that was the first part. M&A environment continues to be great. So we have a very healthy pipeline of deals. We've been active with a large number of deals. We're going to continue to stay active on the M&A front. We do have still significant financial capacity having only spent 1.6 billion and continue to generate strong cash. So that will be the number one use of, of our cash going forward, just as it has been in the past. And we look forward to staying active on the M&A front. Travis Steed : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler Companies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe, maybe. I don't know if this is for you, Kevin or Glenn, but just help reconcile the commentary on. I think you said record new Mako installations, but then, but then the other line was essentially flat this quarter. So, and I think you said there was some international pressure that you saw this quarter. So that would imply, I think you're saying that the domestic Mako number was, I want to say bananas, but very, very strong. Is that the case? Are you starting to see a lot of interest build in the multi-platform capability of Mako or is there something else, just going on where you're seeing such strong domestic demand for Mako? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, just to, just to clarify, in that other line the two biggest components are revenue from Mako installations and then bone cement. The revenue from Mako installations comes from outright cash sales, finance deals through capital and rentals. And as the year progresses, what we typically see in the back half of the year is that more of our customers choose rental agreements which ultimately, usually end up in purchase agreements a year later. And so even though we have a large number of installations, we're only booking rental income on a monthly basis. And so that's what you feel revenue wise in that line. Then the other thing is that I mentioned is that bone cement, continues to decline, and that really is primarily just a factor of growth we're seeing in our cementless business. And so those are the two pieces that make that up. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. So I guess just specifically then, I mean, did the domestic Mako number surprised to the upside in the quarter in terms of the installation. Kevin Lobo : It didn't surprise to the upside, it continued to be strong. So we've had continued strength in installations, both in the U.S. as well as international. Sometimes the revenue number, it looks volatile because of deal mix primarily. Where you have a lot of cash sales versus a lot of finance deals, but steady, I would call it, steady good growth in installations, both internationally and in the U.S. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Okay. And then, you know, as I look at the ortho business and I know Medical's got a ton of growth in front of it. But the ortho business and your three biggest buckets continues to be well above market averages in terms of growth. And I think trauma extremity actually accelerated here in Q3. So just the confidence that you can continue to take this much market share. I don't know if you benefited from your competitor issues in large joints here in Q3 or not, but just the confidence and the ability to unnecessarily [ph] put up this level of growth, but to grow so much faster than the market in 2025 and even in 2026. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : I'll start with Trauma Extremities because if you look, they had a very big comp from last year, it still posted a very significant number. And we're very confident in the Future of Trauma to extremities, Shoulder, as you know, has been a very strong grower double digits pretty consistently. Last week, I had a chance to go to the Orthopedic Trauma Association, which is our core trauma business unit, the biggest of the three business units within Trauma Extremities. And I would say I got to see the full force of our trauma team at that meeting with the Pangea launch with the VOLAR Plating launch for distal radius fractures, they are absolutely on fire. And I see core trauma continuing to be a very strong grower. Pangea is just getting started, and they're already posting tremendous growth, fantastic management team, very engaged. I'll tell you, it was a very exhilarating conference to see that last week and that momentum will continue. And then Foot and Ankle and Biologics. Biologics was very strong double-digit growth. Foot and ankle used to be kind of a high single-digit grower, a little bit lower than that this year. So in spite of that, you're still seeing these very, very big growth rates. And we're actually bullish that the angle will start to pick up a little bit and that will contribute to future growth. So I would say Trauma Extremities is a big business and a double-digit kind of overall grower at least for the foreseeable future. And then getting back to hips and knees, we just continue to grow the makeup sort of percent of procedures done in knees, percent of procedures done in hips. Cementless continues to grow quarter after quarter after quarter. Insignia was obviously a massively important launch for our hip business. We launched the Hinge product for revisions for knees that is going extremely well. So tremendous product momentum across the board from quarter-to-quarter, how much market share will we take hard to predict exactly. But we've said for quite some time now, we're going to grow above the market. What level above the market, let's see how that plays out. But we're in a very good position with our portfolio, with our talent, with our culture across all of these orthopedic businesses. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice sprint here. Kevin, maybe my first one on Mako here. I think in the past you mentioned about a certain percentage of hips being performed robotically in the U.S. I think that number was maybe 25%, 30%. Where are we on Mako utilization? Any qualitative numbers and is it up mid singles up double digits? How should we think about utilization? What percentage of hips are being done robotically right now? Jason Beach : Hey Vijay, it\u2019s Jason. I'll dial that number in for you a bit more precisely in January. But what I would tell you is, those numbers continue to progress in a positive direction quarter-after-quarter. And with the offense that we're playing, we certainly think that will continue that pace in the fourth quarter and beyond. Kevin Lobo : Yes. We moved -- Vijay, we moved to a once a year disclosure of that given that our competitors don't disclose their percentage that are done on their robotic platforms. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Kevin, one on the macro environment here. I know you've said procedure environment remains healthy. I think in the past, you've spoken about wait times as sort of being a leading indicator. When you look at the wait times, where are we right now from procedure scheduling perspective? And I think on the capital side backlog, does it still remain robust did it grow sequentially? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : It's just on scheduled times. The reason we sort of say we still think the market is healthy as wait times are about -- this is again not super scientific, just given the data we have, but it's roughly double the wait times that we're pre-pended. So average wait times were kind of two months or so. Scheduled -- surgery schedules were booked out about two months now they're booked out more like four months. There are some surgeons that are booked out an entire year. And so we're just not seeing that go back. It's staying at that kind of normalized level which gives us -- it doesn't give us a full year visibility, but it gives us visibility out of at least probably four to six months because it's a good idea. You'd start to see things slowing down on the intake ahead of time. So that's why we feel pretty good about it. But again, every quarter, we get a chance to talk to you if we see something change, we'll let you know, but we're not seeing any change whatsoever, at least not now. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Hey thanks so much for letting me in. A couple clarifying questions on Mako. So one, there was a last [ph] question on some color around that product line and ways of purchasing and so on. So just a quick one, I think, is the mix on leasing in the U.S. versus the mix on leasing OUS more cash purchases in one geography and other that kind of that kind of color might be helpful. And then I had just one quick follow-up. Glenn Boehnlein : Matt, in terms of our leasing business relative to Mako, we see more leasing and financing in the U.S. versus OUS. And I would agree that we also see more rentals in the U.S. than OUS. Matthew Miksic : Okay. That's super helpful. And then kind of mix question, given the strength in that business and frankly, in ortho general is, can you give us any color on the maybe the change in the percentage of new robot installations going into ASCs as a site of care versus more traditional acute care centers or centers that would be super helpful if you're willing to share any color. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. Just like we said before on the previous question, we're going to, once a year, kind of give you those kind of metrics rather than doing it every single quarter just for competitive reasons. But suffice to say that the percentage of Mako is going into ASCs is going up with the increase in the number of ASCs. We love our ASC offense. And typically, as we win our ASC deals, at least one of those operating groups tends to have a Mako in it. And so we'll share that more of that at the end of the year. Matthew Miksic : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steven Lichtman : Thank you, hi guys. Just on Spine. You are obviously increasing your presence on the enabling technologies here. Do you see your platform there, obviously, led by Mako as sort of the driver for accelerated growth as you look ahead? Or are there other pipeline products or M&A areas that you think could help bolster growth in that segment as well? Kevin Lobo : Well, in the short term, I would say the enabling tech is really the engine for growth, both Mako spine as well as Copilot. Of course, like every business, we have a number of products that the teams are working on. And as those products launch, they'll also be contributors. But for us, the robot was a major gap in the portfolio and Copilot is -- gives us a bit of a leap forward and spine surgeons are more than ever interested in enabling technologies. And we know what that's done to hips and knees and are hopeful that, that will really put us back on offense. We've been kind of playing defense for spine for quite some time. So I would say that's our immediate focus. The team, of course, are working on other innovative products. But this is the biggest area of opportunity for us, at least in the short term. Steven Lichtman : Got it. Thanks. And then, Glenn, just I think following up on Larry's question from earlier, looking at below-the-line expenses next year, any direction you can provide on sort of interest expense compared to 2024 based on what you guys have do and a refinancing? Jason Beach : Steven, it's Jason. We'll get into more of that certainly in January. But at this point, we won't provide any more guidance relative to 2025. Steven Lichtman : Okay, understood. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you and good afternoon. I wanted just to dive a little bit more deeply on the international side. And I appreciate, Kevin, this is something that you've been focused on for several years. As we look across the portfolio now, you're still ending up in the 25-ish percent of sales being OUS. Can you give us a sense of which businesses perhaps don't lend themselves to significant OUS expansion versus those that do. And then a number of your competitors have talked about exiting markets OUS. And does that provide an opportunity to accelerate your penetration into those geographies? Kevin Lobo : Yes. The biggest opportunity to have isn't really taking advantage of competitors exiting. It's really taking our technologies to these markets and earning our fair share. And by far, the biggest opportunities are in the MedSurg portion of our portfolio. Neurovascular is already very well penetrated internationally. But actually, it's the reverse of the rest of Stryker, where the majority of their sales are actually outside the United States. And then we have some other business like hips that are quite strong internationally. Traumas are strong internationally. But basically, all the other divisions of our company, especially in the MedSurg, we have massive opportunities. The business that are a little less likely to be great internationally, something like a Sage those products are terrific, but they involve extra cost to prevent infections, and there are certain markets that are just not as interested in those businesses. But I would call them more of one-off types of businesses, but the vast majority of our MedSurg portfolio lends itself very well to international deployments. Not something like Vocera will take time. We have to do translation. So these things just take time. The reason -- one of the biggest reasons why we have such a high percentage of U.S. sales is because we keep buying companies that have only U.S. revenue. And then it takes us time to then take those products to international markets. But the way you should think about it is this is a multiyear 10, 15-year tailwind for our company just given our starting position if you think of something like power tools, where we had 33% market share 5, 6 years ago, we've now crossed 50%. We're far from the market share we have in the United States. And it's just not something that spikes dramatically in one year. It takes the steady drumbeat of adding sales forces and penetrating and providing training and education. And so it's a very nice to push to our revenue and being able to grow double digits organically as we have the last couple of years, we're going to continue to do that for many years to come. So that for Stryker provides tremendous upside versus other companies that are already well penetrated in international markets. David Roman : That's very helpful. And maybe on the Mako expanded application in shoulder and spine, as you think about what makes us be able to accomplish on the hip and knee side, really consolidating a lot of market share around robotics as that's become increasingly so standard-of-care. What should we expect to see something similar on the shoulder and spine side where the application of robotics ends up being a significant share driver overall? And is this the path to catalyzing your Spine business, maybe more specifically to the number one or number two position? Kevin Lobo : Well, if I -- I'll start with Spine. So in the case of Spine, our Mako robotic solution, I wouldn't say is materially different than the other offerings. So it's a very competitive offering. It's a good offering, but we're not first, and it's not incredibly differentiated. The Copilot product is fat. So our ecosystem I'm delighted with. If you take the Q guidance and incredibly fast camera plus Copilot plus Mako spine together as a system, very exciting. A robot by itself isn't not as differentiating as it is in hips and knees. When I think about shoulder, I'm wildly excited about potential. Now we don't necessarily need it. Our shoulder business is absolutely humming and growing extremely well with great implants. We already have the Blueprint software, which is fabulous for surgical preplanning. That Blueprint will feed Mako, and we will do bone preparation, and so it will make a very hard procedure much more easy to accomplish. So I'm extremely bullish on its potential and shoulder, I would say, as much as I am in the knee business. So shoulder should be great spine. I think it will make us very competitive, and it will be good, but not as transformational as the potential is in shoulder. David Roman : Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : No problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Christopher Pasquale : Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Vertos acquisition. Pain is a therapeutic area that you had is interest in for some time. You're there now. They're now in a bigger way with Vertos. You talk about your plans for that mild procedure? And do you see that as a platform that you can build on to add other solutions in interventional pain, or do you view that as more of a one-off tuck-in? Kevin Lobo : It's definitely not a one-off. We're really excited. We have an amazing IBS business. It's been high performing for quite some time. It's not the first deal we've done. We did the Spine Jack acquisition. We did the curved balloons that we bought from CareFusion during the BD acquisition of CareFusion. We picked up the curve balloons. We've had our own internal innovation as well. We launched OptoBlades, so we have both the pain as well as the oncology business within our IBS business, but it is a fabulous business. This is solving real problems that patients have in deep box, the ligament and then the pain subsides and then that obviously all beats the need for more serious surgery. So we're very excited. We want to fill back up. We have an amazing leadership team there in sales force that knows how to win. And I wouldn't say we're going to stop. I think we do have another internal innovation that's planned. We haven't communicated yet. We'll probably communicate that in the first quarter, which we're very excited about. And so that business will continue to be a high grower for Stryker in the future. And I wouldn't say we're done. Christopher Pasquale : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Roth MKM. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jason Wittes : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So clearly, one of the biggest trends in knee is the move towards cementless knees. But if you look at the data, it's almost entirely driven by Mako. At least the numbers I've seen are well above or -- 75% or so. So just looking at the competition, is there any other commercial rollout out there that's even capable of making the appropriate cuts to put in a cementless knee, or is that kind of what's driving sort of this dominance here? Kevin Lobo : Well, let's start just sort of we wanted to take. We've been 10 years in the market with cementless. So we launched cementless prior to Mako. And we have incredible long-term data that shows that our cementless offering provides fantastic results. We have good long-term data, 5-year industry data that's 99% success rate. So this is a huge advantage for us. When a surgeon is thinking of moving to cementless, knowing they have a proven implant is big. You're right that the cut and the precision of our cut lends itself to really doing a press fit knee or cementless need. And our percentage of cementless with Mako is much higher than our percentage of cementless with standard instruments. But we do have quite a lot of surgeons doing standard knee replacement with cementless offering. And the competition is much later in providing their offering. Some of them are just launching a cementless now. It takes -- it took time. Surgeons aren't going to switch right away. They're going to want to make sure that there's no aseptic loosening. They're going to follow their patients very carefully for the first six months, 1 year. Some of the prior versions of cementless hasn't gone well. So some of them are scarred from that. So I think for the competition, it's just going to take time, just like it did for us. It took us time early on. We just have a massive head start in the timing. And now we have long-term data, which proves that this is a terrific solution. So we love our position. That was our bet. We bet on cementless and robotics and did not launch our new knee system, and we're in a good position right now because of it. Jason Wittes : Yes, agreed. And if I think about hips, I mean same game plan. I mean, obviously, different flow different approach, but you're obviously a first mover in terms of just the implant or just the technology. Do you see sort of those things position you better in hips right now than everybody else? Or how should we think about how that's going to sort of work its way through because you obviously knees were kind of the first focus and obviously hips have -- not that they're new, but they're kind of followed knees. Kevin Lobo : Yes, look the knee and knee is more obvious because there's a lot more dissatisfied patients in knees. And hips has a much higher satisfaction rate. So sometimes it's not as obvious the need for hips. And that's why we try to get it in front of surgeons so they can see them. The power of Mako with pelvic tilt information. We also have of course the insignia stem which is doing great. I forgot to mention that Tridenti hipcup. So we have a 3D printed hipcup which the surgeons absolutely love. That's actually our first I'd call it replacement product. Most of the 3D printing products we've done across our business including CMF as well as our hips and knees business. I've mostly been innovation around 3D printing to enable cementless as an example. But we actually have replaced our hipcup with a 3D printed hipcup which provides fantastic fixation. And with Mako you actually don't need to have fluoroscopy during the direct anterior procedure. So getting lead out of the operating room is a big deal and we're only just starting to market that. And as surgeons realize that initially they'll reduce the number of shots because it gives them comfort and security doing the direct anterior method of procedure. But we're starting to see more and more surgeons reduce the number of shots and then actually get it out of. Get radiation out of the operating room, which not only makes the surgeon happy and makes all the surgical staff very happy. And you can do that with make go over hips. So that is one of the compelling advantages that our system has that we're going to continue to start to push so that that should over time increased the uptake of Mako hips. And of course outside the United States that there's a lot more hip procedures done. It it's not nearly as weighted to knees other than India. The rest of the world has much more balance between hips and knees and they're seeing the benefit of the hip application. Japan is a good example where the hip business is doing extremely well on Mako. So yes, there's a lot more upside. It takes a little longer because it's not as obvious that you're going to get these benefits until you actually try it. And that's. We're trying to educate our customers on these benefits. Jason Wittes : Great. Thanks for all the detail, Kevin. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Kevin Lobo : No problem. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yes, thanks. I just have another one on Mako. I guess with spine and shoulder coming you're kind of a different position as a company that you have such a huge installed base already of systems that are out there. So is it safe to assume that your existing installed base will provide an advantage in that you could potentially upgrade some of those to either do spine and/or shoulder? Or do you catch most of those or about doing those procedures to be sort of more greenfield placements? Kevin Lobo : I think the answer is probably a bit of both. But what we most benefit from is the brand of Mako. Mako is a brand that is trusted that is known that they have success and experience buying already. And so having another application on a proven robot, I think, is a massive advantage, whether they add the application to existing robots other they purchase a stand-alone robot for their spine surgeon. In either case, they have experience with the robot. They have trust with the robot. They have trust with the brand of Mako. I think that gives us a massive advantage, absolutely. Michael Matson : Okay, got it. And then just the pricing looks good this year. I know you're not giving guidance for next year, but maybe you can just talk about what you're seeing there, kind of the areas where you're seeing better or worse pricing and just the -- your expectation of the sustainability. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Mike, I think, the year's unfolded. If you think about Q1, we had positive 0.7% Q2 positive 1.1%, and now Q3, positive 1.2%. So we're seeing good results from the programs that we put in place. And keep in mind, too, the programs sort of span the outlet from working with large health care systems contractually, but even working on smaller scale individual hospitals or even ASCs drive better pricing and an understanding of why we are driving that kind of pricing. And so I do think that we've exercised this muscle across our business, both in the U.S. and international that now has just become systemic in our business. And so it is something that will get attention in every deal that we do. Moving forward, I don't expect that to change. I'm sure things could get more competitive, and we'll provide that kind of guidance when we hit January. But right now, we're very bullish on this year and where we're going to get to pricing. Michael Matson : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS Equities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Clearly, a lot of momentum here. I was wondering if I could focus the conversation on the Orthopedics business, large joint orthopedics. And I appreciate your position, your competitive position with Mako and things like that. But I thought I'm just curious at a high level, I mean, you guys continue to it seems like you continue to gain share here. And I'm curious what is the leading driver there? I mean is it led by the robot? Is it led by the product offering and Stryker ability to provide a broad swath of product offerings to the ASC? And then follow-up, now the follow-up is on ASC specifically, and where we are in the transition of procedures, large joint orthopedic procedures to the ASC? Thanks so much. Jason Beach : Hey Danielle, it's Jason. I would say in terms of our ability to win here, it's a combination of probably all the things that you just listed, frankly. But I would say we've been very consistent here in terms of the messaging of how we're going to win in the market, how the market is going to play out for several quarters now, right? If you look and just start with our Mako installed base, and we've had a number of quarters now of record installations. If you think about how that translates into growth in our hips and knees business, that's certainly a positive. And then when you think about from a utilization standpoint, obviously, I commented that we'll add a bit more color in January. But that continues to go up. So again, just a variety of positive factors. Glenn talked about price that certainly is a piece of what we see as well. But certainly, several factors. Your question on the ASC environment, Kevin commented on this earlier as well, where we continue to see the Mako footprint built out in the ASC environment, again, helping the hips and knees business. I can, I'll provide in January. We typically view this once a year in terms of percentage of large joints down in the ASC, but that continues to go up as well. So it's certainly a variety of factors that are attributing to our growth over time. Kevin Lobo : Yes. The last thing I'd add is when you see sustained performance over time, that's one of the things we really value at Stryker. If you look at our -- if you go to our national sales meetings, and we have numerous awards for performance over time. To sustain something requires -- yes, you need the portfolio, but people catch up and sometimes someone jumps ahead of you. And so the portfolio by itself is not ever going to be enough to have sustained high performance. It's also the culture and the sales force, the way we hire our sales force, how engaged our sales forces are, how well they execute. I mean that has been a hallmark of Stryker and it spans the entire corporation. The way we add sales forces and split territories and split divisions and we are an incredibly sales driven organization and our teams are highly engaged and they're very high performing and sometimes not always with the leading product in some cases, but they know how to sell and that' been a strength for a long, long time at Stryker and that is still very alive today. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really strong third quarter performance. So my first question. Can you guys put any quantification around the amount of dilution or earnings dilution from the roughly $300 million of deals you did in 2024 that you need to overcome? And is all of that going to be absorbed in 2024. Is there going to be any kind of impact from a dilution standpoint in 2025? And can you quantify either? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Hi, Richard, we -- the only thing we've really commented on, and I think Kevin said this, is that we will cover the dilution, and it's contemplated in the guidance that we have provided for this full year. And it's anticipated that, that dilution will be covered next year as well. Richard Newitter : Okay, thanks. And if you could actually -- I'll take another one in, just what divisions, the key acquisitions go into, if you could just remind us for modeling? And then my second question, a real second question, ischemic stroke, Kevin, what do you think it's going to take to turn that business around? Is that a product fix? Is that a sales organization fixed? How can you reaccelerate the momentum in that franchise? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, thanks. Look, the assuming segment has been more demanding and challenging. We had some supply challenges on our flow avering [ph] spend portfolio. So that is being rectified. So we're feeling better about that as we end this year and go into next year. On the aspiration side, there's just a large number of competitors. We do have -- we've launched the Vecta 46, a really good catheter and aspiration cap is doing well. But we are looking at some sales force changes perhaps because in some cases, the competitors that only sell that and our sales force has to sell a broad suite of products. And so we have had a little bit of experimentation on some dedicated sales reps that are only selling a shoe mix. So we're looking at a number of different options to try to short that business. But I would say we still love the neurovascular space. It's just that the segment has become very competitive with a lot of new entrants. And we're looking at different options to be able to improve that. So we do have a good portfolio. So the portfolio isn't the biggest part of the problem. We did have a supply chain issue as getting down. Richard Newitter : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about sustainability of the pricing trends, which have been better over time in the 2025? And then also, if you have to think about an upside scenario for 2025. What will be the source of that? Is it better ortho growth or MedSurg outperformance? Where do you think you could surprise? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Matt. On pricing, I think we've told you everything we can on 2024 to be honest. And in January, we'll provide full guidance on where we think pricing will come out for 2025. Jason Beach : Yes. Matt, I would just say also, as it relates to kind of sustainability of growth, probably the same answer there that as we think about the different areas of the business, we'll certainly get into more in January as we think about areas of growth. Matthew Taylor : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. I'll try to be quick here at the end. So Glenn, I know you said you've said about everything you can on price. But can I just confirm, I think this is your first quarter of positive orthopedic pricing, at least as far back as my model goes in 2012, and if memory serves, I bet it acted like 2006 or 2007 when orthopedic pricing first really started to slip across the industry? And how much of that is Stryker flexing its muscle the way you kind of qualified it earlier in your comments versus just hospitals have realized they kind of cut the bone and in an inflationary environment, if they want innovation out of all of your manufacturers, you need to start -- they need to maybe stop asking for those bigger price cuts every year and things like that. Thanks. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. I think, first of all, you're correct. This is the first quarter for positive orthopedic pricing growth. Keep in mind, a lot of that was driven in international markets and then especially in international markets where we saw more extreme FX and inflationary pressures, which we obviously adjust our pricing in those markets to match that. I would say in the U.S. orthopedic market, we're seeing good performance, but we're not necessarily seeing positive performance on pricing in the U.S. orthopedic's market. Jeffrey Johnson : All right. That's helpful. And then Kevin, just last one. Just I think way back many years ago, we used to think about like medical, endo and instruments. One would be going through a new cycle double-digit, strong double-digit growth. One would be coming up against tough comps from a cycle, maybe 18, 24 months earlier, it was in the mid-single digits and then one of the other segments kind of in between. Your double digits in all those segments year-to-date. Are we -- is there just so much diversity now diversification in those three units, and they're so big that you can just kind of keep up product cycles across all three, and we don't really have to think about at least the valley part of that in any of these segments and given years down to 5% growth or something like that? Just think about conceptually the balance between medical endo and instruments. Thanks. Kevin Lobo : Listen, I think that was extremely well said. But what you just described is exactly what the strategy has been to diversify away from purely capital businesses to get into high-growth segments to make these bigger, stronger businesses that's underneath the noise of the business. You can have some parts of the business may be slowing a little bit, but other parts accelerating. And overall, living in the double-digit growth for the overall division. So that is very well said. And frankly, that's what we've experienced, if you look at the last three years. You're not seeing the peaks and troughs you used to see in those businesses, if you go back 6, 7, 8, 9 years ago, and you should expect going forward that you're going to have much more sort of sustainable, consistent growth at those divisional levels, so well said. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Caitlin Cronin : Hi, congrats on a great quarter. And thanks for taking the question. I guess just turning back to M&A. I think you've been focused on top line growth through acquisitions, but I've also noted that the margin expansion expectations is really inclusive of the recent acquisitions. I guess just stepping back, how do you think about the margins of potential acquisitions? Is there a floor? Or is it more fluid if you're able to see how you can drive efficiencies. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Caitlin, I think as we look at our modeling for M&A, obviously, we're looking for fast-growing markets. We're looking for things that are accretive to Stryker. And sometimes that accretion is over a longer period of time and some of it's over a shorter period of time. I mean, ultimately, we're going to drive all these acquisitions to be accretive and accretive to the op margin line, and especially accretive with the EPS line. But the modeling and the timing of that can extend over a period of time. For product tuck-ins, those are fairly immediate for close adjacencies, those maybe take a little bit longer. Kevin Lobo : But being a high-growth acquirer, we're not going to look at a dilution as something that scares us off, and as we said the deals, we're going to just absorb the early dilution, and we know that that's going to then become accretive to come over time. Caitlin Cronin : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Eric Anderson : Great. Thank you. This is Eric on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. On Ortho, congrats on a really strong quarter and results there. One of your competitors has shared that they're going through a restructuring of their ortho business. I was just curious if you've seen any impact from that and to what extent it may have been a benefit this quarter? Thank you. Jason Beach : Eric, it's Jason. I would say typically, we don't comment on competitor comments. And continue to rely on the offense that we're playing. So we'll certainly continue to do that as we move forward. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you all for joining our call. We are excited about the business momentum that we have going forward and look forward to sharing the fourth quarter and full year results with you in January. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the third quarter 2024 Stryker Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2024 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Luke, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. The following conference will include -- we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call will be recorded for replay purposes. For your planning purposes, and given the amount of content we have to cover, in the event the call runs long, we plan to end the call no later than 6 p.m. EST. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I would now like to turn over the call to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir. Kevin Lobo : Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; Andy Pierce, Group President, MedSurg on Neurotechnology; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide open comments followed by Andy, who will expand on our strategic rationale for the pending Inari acquisition. Jason will then follow with the trends we saw during the quarter and some product updates. Finally, Glenn will offer further details on our 2024 results and 2025 guidance, as well as financial elements of Inari Medical and Spine before we open the call to Q&A. First, as you saw in our press release, Glenn Fogel has decided to retire from Stryker effective April 1, after a very successful nine year tenure as our CFO. He will be replaced by Preston Wells who most of you know from his time in the Investor Relations role. I would like to thank Glenn for his outstanding leadership and great partnership with me and Stryker leaders as we grew the company significantly, delivered consistent strong financial results and have positioned it very well for the future. Now let's move to our 2024 results, which were excellent, both for Q4 and the full year. Against double-digit comparatives from a year ago, organic sales growth exceeded 10% for both Q4 and the full year. Globally, for the full year, our instruments, endoscopy, medical, neuro cranial and trauma and extremities businesses all delivered double-digit organic sales growth. Full year U.S. organic sales growth was an impressive 10.6% and international organic sales growth was 8.8%. International results were led by strong performances in Canada, emerging markets in Europe. International continues to represent a significant opportunity for both our legacy businesses and recent acquisitions. We also had excellent earnings performance, including the dilutive impacts from the seven acquisitions that we completed in 2024, we exceeded our adjusted operating margin goals, delivering an improvement of 200 basis points in Q4 and 110 basis points for the full year versus 2023. Our quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $4.01 and $12.19 represents 16% growth for Q4 and 15% growth compared to the full year of 2023. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the durability of our high-growth offense, driven by organic innovation, focused M&A and terrific commercial execution as well as strong earnings power. We have momentum entering 2025 and expect to continue delivering sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2025 guidance of organic sales growth of 8% to 9%. This growth, combined with continuing operating margin expansion translate to an adjusted EPS of $13.45, $13.70 per share before considering the impact of Inari Medical, which Glenn will cover. We also announced an agreement to sell our Spinal Implants business, which has faced challenges in achieving our performance expectations. This sale will place the Spinal Implants business in the hands of new owners that have extensive experience in the spine market and it allows us to better align our resources. We continue to be excited about Interventional Spine, which is one of our fastest-growing businesses and was bolstered by the recent acquisition of Vertos Medical. Additionally, we remain committed to enabling technologies for the spine market, including our Q Guidance System, Copilot and Mako Spine. These portfolio decisions reflect a continuation of our strategy to drive category leadership in attractive, high-growth end markets. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Pierce : Thanks, Kevin. Our entry into the peripheral vascular market is a logical adjacency to our Neurovascular division given their complementary product portfolios and parallel sites of service. With the acquisition of Inari, Stryker will be a leading player in the fast-growing area of chemical thrombectomy treatment for venous thromboembolism or VTE. Mechanical thrombectomy for represents a $15 billion addressable opportunity with the U.S. comprising the $6 billion of that opportunity. Today, less than one-fifth of treatments for VTE are with mechanical thrombectomy. And we, therefore, believe this opportunity will expand over time as hospitals and clinicians look to elevate the standard of care for VTE. We believe Inari Solutions, which are supported by clinical research demonstrating their effectiveness, representing significant opportunity for our portfolio. Since bringing its ClotTriever and flow treater products to market in 2017, Inari has seen tremendous revenue growth in excess of 20% annually with a gross margin profile of approximately 85%. In addition to its treatments for VTE, Inari has invested in four exciting therapies to address unmet needs in other patient populations. These emerging therapies include chronic venous disease, dialysis access management, acute limb ischemia and chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Together, they represent over $5 billion of incremental market segment opportunity globally. We believe Stryker's international presence can help Inari more rapidly into global markets. In recent years, Inari has made strides globally and is currently helping improve patient outcomes in over 30 markets, primarily in Europe and certain parts of Asia. Its international business is approximately 7% of sales. Stryker has long been a global leader in interventional neurovascular procedures. And with the addition of Inari, we will be equipped with a more comprehensive interventional endovascular portfolio. By launching the R&D and clinical capabilities of both organizations, we will have a greater opportunity to accelerate innovation and meet customer needs. From a commercial perspective, we are excited about the great synergies that exist between our teams. Inari brings significant operational infrastructure, which includes a commercial organization with attractive call points, including interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Inari's strong commercial model and patient-focused mission aligns well with Stryker's culture and our go-to-market strategy in Neurovascular. Finally, I would like to thank and recognize Drew Hikes and the entire Inari leadership team for building a strong mission-driven company that is improving patient lives. Inari has done an incredible job establishing this segment and driving adoption through extensive clinical studies and commercial excellence over the last 10-plus years. I'd also like to thank the Stryker team for their tremendous efforts in bringing together our two companies. With our track record in M&A, we have conviction in our ability to drive a successful integration, deliver innovative solutions to our customers and create significant shareholder value. With our long history of investing in customer-focused technologies, we look forward to achieving best-in-class performance through a world-class sales force, a highly complementary and clinically compelling product portfolio and an exciting pipeline to ensure we continue on this segment. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jason. Jason Beach : Thanks, Andy. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as Mako, an update on product launches and an adjustment to our external reporting. Procedural volumes remained healthy in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect the markets will remain strong in 2025, underscored by the continued adoption in robotic-assisted surgery, favorable demographics and healthy levels of patient activity. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained robust with strong organic growth in medical, Instruments and Endoscopy in the quarter and double-digit growth for the full year across all three businesses. Hospital CapEx budgets are healthy and our capital order book remains elevated as we enter 2025. Next, specific to Mako, we had another record quarter and year of installations in the U.S. and worldwide. The progress of our Mako offense, including our direct-to-consumer campaign, has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we are approaching two-third of knees and one-third of hips performed using Mako as we exited the year. Globally, we exited the year with just over 45% of knees and approximately 20% of hips performed using Mako. We have momentum and significant opportunities remain as Mako adoption increases. Mako Spine completed its first cases in October, and we received excellent surgeons feedback. We will continue to progress through our limited market release and remain on track for full U.S. commercial launch in the second half of the year. Next, we received approval from the FDA for our Mako shoulder application, and we're able to perform our first cases in December. We are excited to now offer a complete ecosystem for shoulders, which includes blueprint, our preplanning software, Mako Shoulder and a leading portfolio of shoulder implants. As a reminder, 2025 will also be a limited launch year for Mako shoulder as we carefully gain clinical experience. We expect a full launch in the U.S. by Q1 of 2026. We have continued to see positive momentum driven by our recent product launches. Our Pangia plating system has seen robust customer interest since its launch, driving strong sales growth. Additionally, our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator and monitor continues to draw interest driving meaningful sales performance in the quarter, along with a robust order book. Lastly, we have adjusted our external reporting to better align with how we are organized internally and to reflect the pending divestiture of the spinal implants business. Effective in the fourth quarter, our Spine enabling technologies results are reported as part of other orthopedics and Interventional Spine results are reported as part of neurocrine. As a result, spinal implants is now reported separately within orthopedics. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Boehnlein : Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 10.2% in the quarter compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This quarter had one more selling day than 2023. We had a 1.1% favorable impact from pricing with both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedic segments contributing positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 10.9%. International organic sales growth was 7.9% and was led by positive sales momentum in Canada, Europe and our emerging markets. For the year, our organic sales growth was also 10.2% against a very strong comparable of 11.5% last year. U.S. full year organic growth was 10.6% and international growth was 8.8%. For the full year, the impact from price is favorable 1.1%. Foreign currency had a 0.5% unfavorable impact and 2024 had one more selling day than 2023. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $4.01 was up 15.9% from 2023, driven by higher gross margins and the continued expansion of operating margins. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of $0.05. Our full year adjusted EPS of $12.19 was up 15% from 2023, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth and operating margin expansion partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.13. Now I will provide some more highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 11.1% and organic sales growth of 10.1%, which included 11.5% of U.S. organic growth and 5.8% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 8.8% with healthy growth in both the Surgical Technologies and orthopedic implants businesses. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by smoke evacuation, waste management, power tools and SteriShield. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong growth across all businesses. Growth in the quarter was fueled by robust demand for our OR infrastructure and renovations and the continued success of our 1788 video platform and sports medicine shoulder products. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.1%, driven by double-digit performances in the emergency care and Sage businesses. From a product perspective, the medical business was led by strong sales growth in beds, Sage products, transport capital and defibrillators. LIFEPAK 35 continues to drive excitement in the market with a strong and accelerating order pipeline. Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business and improvement against competitive pressures in our ischemic business. And finally, neurocranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 13.3%, led by strong growth in our bone mill, high-speed drills, bipolar forceps, craniomaxillofacial and interventional spine products. As a reminder, our growth numbers now reflect the changes that Jason discussed earlier, with interventional spine now reported as part of our neurocranial division. Internationally, MedSurg & Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 5.8%, led by growth in our Instruments and Endoscopy businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Canada and the United Kingdom. Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 11.3% and organic sales growth of 10.2%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 10.5% internationally. Our knee business grew 8.5% organically, reflecting our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures and momentum from the continued strength of our new Mako installations. Our U.S. hips business grew 7.1% organically, fueled by the continued success of our Cigna hip stem and momentum of our Mako robotic hip platform. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 16.2% organically with very strong double-digit sales growth in our core trauma and upper extremities businesses. The performance of Pangea continues to ramp amid robust interest and adoption of this differentiated plating portfolio. Our U.S. spinal implants business grew 2.3% organically in the quarter. Our U.S. other ortho business, which now includes Enabling Technologies, grew 1.3% organically, primarily driven by Mako deal mix and a decline in bone cement. Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 10.5% organically, including strong performances in our emerging markets, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Canada. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 65.3% was favorable by 140 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This improvement was primarily driven by positive pricing, manufacturing cost improvements and mix. Adjusted R&D spending was 5.3% of sales, which was 30 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2023. Our adjusted SG&A was 30.8% of sales, which was 20 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2023. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 29.2% of sales which was 200 basis points favorable to the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year, our adjusted operating margin was 25.3%, which was a 110 basis point increase over 2023. Adjusted other income expense of $51 million for the quarter was $20 million higher than 2023, driven by a full quarter of higher interest expense related to our September 2024 debt issuance. For 2025, excluding the impact from the pending acquisition of Inari, we expect our full year other income and expense to be approximately $260 million driven primarily by the full year impact of additional interest expense from our September 2024 debt issuance. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4% and 14.8%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2025, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.5 billion of cash, marketable securities and short-term investments. Total debt was approximately $13.6 billion and includes approximately $3 billion from our bond offerings in September 2024, of which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay down debt of $1.5 billion during the fourth quarter. Turning to cash flow. Our full year 2024 cash from operations was $4.2 billion, an increase of $531 million from 2023, driven mainly by higher earnings and improvements in inventory and accounts payable. For 2025, we anticipate that capital spending will be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. We do not anticipate any share buybacks. And now I will provide full year 2025 guidance. Based on our momentum exiting 2024, a sustained level of procedural volumes strong demand for our capital products and our presence in healthy end markets, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% for 2025, and expect adjusted net earnings per share to be in the range of $13.45 to $13.70, before considering the impact of Inari. This guidance assumes a full year adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, which is in line with our previous assertion to improve op margin to pre-COVID levels. Our sales guidance reflects our expectation that the full year impact of price is modestly favorable. Additionally, if foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted approximately 1% for the full year and that adjusted earnings per share will be negatively impacted in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, both of which are reflected in our guidance. Compared to 2024, we will have one fewer selling day in the first quarter of 2025. The remaining quarters of this year will have the same number of selling days as 2024. Finally, while we did quarterly guidance, we do expect the seasonality of our sales, op margin expansion and related earnings to be similar to 2024. As it relates to the pending close of the Inari acquisition, we expect to fund the $4.9 billion purchase price to a mix of cash on hand and new debt, and anticipate closing this transaction towards the end of February. For the approximately 10-month period ending in December 2025, we expect Inari to deliver approximately $590 million of sales on a constant currency basis and have a dilutive impact on adjusted op margin of 0 to 20 basis points and $0.20 to $0.30 on adjusted EPS. As it relates to the divestiture of our spine implants business, we expect that the impact of this transaction will be absorbed into the above guidance for net sales growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. With that, I will now open the call up for Q&A. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong finish to the year. Kevin, I just wanted to start on the Spine sale. Just -- and first, also, congratulations to both Glenn and Preston. So Kevin, on the Spine sale, just talk about why this was the right time. How much of that $700 million is going to VB, and just the economics of the deal, sale price and how you're offsetting any dilution from the deal. And I had one follow-up. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. Thanks, Larry. Why is now the time? As you know, we've been looking at this market for a long time, and we've been trying to make improvements in our Spine business. We are excited about the enabling tech with Copilot and Mako Spine but fundamentally just have better opportunities to invest our funds in other businesses. And the VB Brothers have a lot of experience in spine. They're going to provide the follow-on innovation that's required in the implant side of the business. As you saw in the press release, we will be partnering together. So we will be providing the enabling tech. They will be providing the implants. The entire $700 million is expected to be divested to them. And so the remaining portions that we're keeping have been moved into other -- the IVS into Neuro Cranial and the Enabling Technology being moved into Other Orthopedics. It's just one of those things where we've moved into so many other faster-growing spaces. And this is really where we'd like to spend our time and our energy. It's, as you know, a very competitive market on the implant side of the business where we just haven't had the same degree of innovation that we've had in other parts of our portfolio. So this felt like the right time. We feel like we've got a really great partner. The business will be in good hands. Our employees will be in good hands, and so will our customers. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks. And then just a follow-up on Inari, maybe for Andy or for Glenn. Just talk about maybe some of the deal assumptions. By our math, the return on invested capital seems relatively low in year five. How do you see ROIC in five years? And when does this deal turn accretive? Thanks for taking the question. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Larry, thanks. We don't really guide on ROIC or talk about it too much, but we generally target to get back to WACC sometime between five and seven years. And I would say Inari fits squarely in that sort of model as we looked at our own modeling on this. We're super excited about their sales growth and the accretion of that to our sales growth, especially once we hit the one year comparable mark on it. And honestly, from an operating income standpoint, we feel there are a lot of opportunities for us to partner with them. And obviously, we have the normal public company synergies that will be in our favor. And then when you work your way down to EPS, most of the impact will result from additional borrowings and the interest expense related to that in terms of the dilution we'll feel at the EPS level. Operator : Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Marcus : Oh, great. Congratulations on a really nice quarter. Glenn, we wish you the best in retirement. It was great working with you. Maybe a follow-up on Larry's questions and ask another way, and this is more of a P&L focus. It's really impressive that you could sell probably one of your lowest-growth businesses and still be able to absorb it within the existing range that people expected and the guidance you provided on operating margins. So maybe just -- we got a good look at where your margin structure was and how you were planning to get there at the Analyst Day a little over a year ago. But as you sit here today and there's a lot of moving pieces from that time to today, what is it that helps you get that 100-plus basis points expansion this year before Inari dilution? And what's still left to go afterwards? And any color into the building blocks would be really helpful. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, sure. Thanks, Robbie. Gosh, there's so many opportunities still as I think through sort of how we look at our structure, how we look at our P&L, how we look at our manufacturing footprint. I would tell you that our GQO group is very excited about purchasing opportunities. We're very excited about expanding sort of our low-cost manufacturing footprint. And we've recently opened up facilities in Poland. We have our Tijuana facility. So there really are still a lot of robust opportunities as we think about how do we streamline. Moving on down the income statement, if I look at operating expenses, we really -- we have scratched pretty hard the shared services sort of aspect of back office and transactional services. But I would say there is room to go for sure. We look at our worldwide facilities in Asia, in Poland and in Costa Rica. And they, first of all, are some of the fastest-growing facilities we have. And so there are really some opportunities to even sort of push more transactional-type activities down to there. Even if we look at sort of leveraging R&D and using our India tech center more often, just from a cost standpoint, we really have an opportunity to drive additional cost savings there, too. And then honestly, a couple of my favorite ways to drive up margin. We are continuing to be very successful gaining price. And it's not just price in the U.S. It's price on a worldwide basis. And then lastly, the way our formula works, we get a lot of natural leverage just by growing sales 8% to 9%. And that model will work, and that model will deliver what we need for 2025. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe a follow-up. If I had to sum my takeaways coming out of our health care conference as it relates to your business from your competitors, it was that the ortho markets remain healthy and stable. Volumes are robust. Less negative pricing, and capital equipment markets remain healthy around the world. I wanted to see if you agree with that outlook. You always have great insights and any other color if there's a difference in geography that you want to add. Thanks a lot. Jason Beach : Hey, Robbie, it's Jason. I'll take this one. I would say well said across the board on the commentary there. I think we're very well aligned with that and feel really good as we enter 2025 really across all three of those. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the questions and congrats, Preston. I look forward to working with you again. I wanted to ask about kind of the M&A. You guys used to have kind of five things on the list and kind of checked one of those off of Inari. So maybe kind of talk about, Kevin, some of your new prioritized list of like focus areas for M&A. And is this going to be a period of kind of digestion? Or is this going to be a period of continued M&A? And I assume that some of the proceeds in the Spine business will help pay down debt. So you can kind of get back on the offense on M&A sooner, if that's the right read. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, what I'd say is even with the debt to purchase Inari, even before any proceeds from Spine, we still -- it takes our debt equity to around 3 times. So we still have capacity to continue to do tuck-in deals. And as a reminder, over the last 12 years, the majority of the deals we do are tuck-ins. And they can range inside. Most of them are kind of small, medium sized. Occasionally, we do a large tuck-in. But we're still on offense and looking at acquisitions. I don't necessarily think that we'll do necessarily one as big as Inari in the near term. But the adjacencies continue to be the ones that I've talked about. Peripheral vascular, obviously, I've mentioned that in the past, and we're very excited to be able to consummate that deal. And the other spaces like -- I've talked about urology. I've talked about neuromodulation. I talked about soft tissue robotics. I've talked about health care IT. Those all remain very interesting spaces for us, but that's in addition to all of the tuck-ins. Every single business is out looking for deals. And you saw the seven that we did last year were all within our existing businesses, and that will continue to be the majority of the deals that we do. Those bring tremendous ROIC returns because we already have existing sales forces and call points. And once Inari is integrated into Stryker, we'll also continue to look within that peripheral space for follow-on acquisitions just as we do with all our businesses. Travis Steed : Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask on the revenue guidance of 7% to 9% there. Kind of another year of above normal growth. And I guess five years now above normal growth. It's probably kind of a new normal of higher growth. And so I wanted to kind of think about like the sustainability of this kind of higher revenue. You've gotten LIFEPAK going and several of the pipeline products. So just kind of talk about the sustainability of this growth rate that you've gotten and the confidence in the revenue guidance for 2025. Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks. Listen, just to clarify, the guidance was 8% to 9% organic. And so on the low end, it's a little bit higher than it was last year. So we feel even less risk on the bottom end of the range. And look, we're feeling very bullish. If you look at all of our businesses, they all have robust pipelines, and they're constantly following on with innovations. Our commercial offenses are extremely strong. I just spent a lot of time with our sales forces in the month of January at our kickoff meetings, and I could tell you the morale and the spirit has never been better. There are big impacts such as Pangea and LIFEPAK 35, those big launches, but there's a series of smaller product launches that are occurring across our portfolio. And so by now, I would hope everyone thinks and knows that it's durable. We're doing it year after year after year, and I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. Operator : Our next question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Roman : Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to just follow up maybe on a couple of strategic questions here. I think on the last call, you had cited that the acquisitions you had completed in 2024 were expected to contribute about $300 million this year. Can you maybe just give us an update on how that's progressing, how you're thinking about commercial strategy there? And any updates that you have observed since you've been able to close these deals? Kevin Lobo : Yes, sure. First of all, I'd tell you, I'm extremely excited about the deals. All of the acquisitions are actually at or above the deal model. Kind of unusual for us. Normally, you'd have one or two that are a little bit below the model, but they've all taken off really, really well. And so that $300 million, we feel very confident about achieving or surpassing. The integrations, frankly, are very simple on these deals because they tuck into existing call points in existing business units of the company. In some cases, we've actually added some specialized sales forces, just additional specialized people. In the case of -- certainly of Vertos, we've added some additional sales feet on the street. And that -- some of them came obviously with the company, and we've decided to add some. But adding sales feet on the street is something we do every year. All of our businesses are constantly looking to split territories, to split sales forces or parts of sales forces. And we've created a number of small new sales forces across the company and continue to add salespeople, but it's quite an easy integration when you tuck it into an existing business with existing call points. David Roman : And then maybe just a follow-up on the Mako Shoulder rollout. I think as -- your competitor is also coming out with the robotic shoulder solution that described similarly a measured and gradual rollout. Maybe you could just help us understand some of the dynamics in the shoulder market, how we should think about the addressable market here, the pace of adoption, if knees or hips was a good proxy and how the robotic shoulder market should kind of evolve in your view over the next maybe one to three years. Kevin Lobo : Listen, I'm extremely excited about Mako Shoulder. It's a very difficult procedure to do. And the harder the procedure is, the more the robot brings value. And in our case, we're doing bone preparation with haptics with our robot in a tight space. So the surgeon feedback -- early feedback is extremely exciting, at least as exciting in knees, if not more. Now it does require a lot of change management, and we learned that through the knee launch, that sometimes you have to go a little slow at the beginning so they can go fast later on. And so this year is going to be really getting the training protocols well-defined and established, and we'll really start to see more acceleration in 2026 and beyond. So not much of an impact commercially, but our shoulder business doesn't really need it. It's growing strong double digits. It's been doing that since we acquired Wright Medical and had a fantastic year in 2024, and we'll have another great year in 2025 even without the impact of Mako. But this will take it to another whole other level. And as you know, as you've seen with knees, our robotic solution is clearly compelling and will be very differentiating. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, good afternoon. Glenn, thanks for all the years in Preston, looking forward to working with you again. On Spine divestitures, like I know there's no color here on the economics around this transaction. But from a modeling perspective, with the deal closing in the first half of the year, how should we think about EPS seasonality this year? Does the transaction change the normal EPS seasonality of Stryker? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes, Pito. Yes. Honestly, when we pull Spine out, it's -- first of all, it's not really material to the overall numbers that we're delivering. And so I would say the seasonality that you saw in 2024 will generally carry forward to 2025 in terms of the cadence of sales, op margin expansion and EPS. Pito Chickering : All right. Great. And then in 2024, Medical had a huge year. This never gets the same air time as the other divisions. How should we think about growth there for 2025? And sort of what are the big growth drivers in Medical for this year? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes, I've said this many times. I think it's the most underappreciated division within our company. And you should expect another year of double-digit growth in Medical. They have a tremendous number of growth drivers, tremendous momentum across, whether it's Sage, emergency care, acute care, beds, wireless stretchers, Vocera. It's just -- there's just a series of tremendous opportunities across the portfolio. So they're posting double digits on top of double-digit growth years, and I expect another year of double-digit growth in 2025. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Glenn, wishing you the best. And Preston, congratulations. Well deserved. I guess my first question, just a guidance clarification. Inari, is the maximum dilution impact here 20 basis points, Glenn? Is that what you're saying? And Spine, I think the comment you made was Spine will be absorbed in the current guidance. Does it mean the EPS of $13.45 to $13.70, that's intact even without Spine? Glenn Boehnlein : You heard it right. Inari will be maximum 20 basis points dilutive to our op margin expansion. And Spine will be absorbed in the EPS guidance that we gave of $13.45 to $13.70. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then maybe one related question here on -- with Spine below corporate margin, is that sort of aiding margins here? Inari, Kevin, this is a fairly quick deal close time. Sometimes we do have sales force disruption when deals were announced. But given the fairly quick deal turnaround time, I'm assuming that should be minimal here. Is that a fair assumption? And how do you guys get comfortable? I know there was some noise around a DOJ investigation. If you could just clarify on how you got comfortable, that would be helpful. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Hi, Vijay. I'm going to ask Andy to answer that since he's here in the room with us. Go ahead, Andy. Andy Pierce : Sure, Vijay. The timing of the deal close, we do anticipate, as noted, to be by the end of February. And we got pretty comfortable around that based on regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions. And we feel like we're going to be in pretty good shape there. And then secondarily to your question around the CID, of course, that was an area where we did go deep into -- in gaining our understanding what the risk was with the CID. And as you see, of course, we went through with the transaction. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Maybe this one is for Andy specifically. But just based on my math of the $560 million, thinking about the annual contribution from Inari, it looks like it's about $670 million. So roughly about $40 million, $50 million of lost sales, I think, that you're factoring in versus what the Street had been modeling. So that's about 11% growth. So kind of well below market. Andy, do you think you can get this business back to market growth? Or do you need to fold in other technologies to be able to do that type of growth in the future, be it Aspiration, et cetera? Kevin Lobo : Let me be really clear. This is only for 10 months' worth of sales. We are assuming high double-digit growth in this business. So not very far off from the growth rate they have. We are not assuming any falloff. And you can follow up with Jason, afterwards. It was $590 million, not $560 million. And it's only for 10 months of the year, not 12 months of the year. So we are not assuming a falloff. We think the sales force is going to stay very engaged. There isn't any overlap with our business. So there's not -- we're not going to have the sales force integration challenges that we have had with overlapped deals. This plugs right alongside our existing business, and we plan to continue to make this business sing just the way they have as an independent company. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Yes. Got it. Got it. Thanks. I'll figure out how to do math one of these days. And then, Kevin, for you specifically, I know it's early in the year, but just the top line guide of 8% to 9%, and you're trying to be, I'm sure, somewhat conservative, but just getting even to the low end of that range just given the momentum in Trauma and Extremities looks unbelievably good. Medical, you just talked about double digits, well above average on the hip and knee side of things. I just guess what would get you down to the 8%-ish range versus midpoint or even higher just given, again, all the momentum that we see in the business? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, I feel really good about the business. Look, it's early in the year. And so the activity levels, procedure levels, capital, we have good visibility, at least for the first six, seven, eight months. But that's not a full year, and things can change. So obviously, every quarter, we're going to continue to update our guidance. And last year, you saw us steadily move up our guidance. I'm not going to predict what will happen this year. But assume that we're going to continue to be playing offense, and we're going to continue to launch products. Those have to continue to go smoothly as they have in the past. And if everything goes to plan, we could expect another very strong year towards the upper end of our guidance or potentially moving it up. But I certainly don't feel risk on the downside. And I'm hopeful that if we continue the momentum the way it is that we'll be able to deliver above where we're currently guiding. But remains to be seen. Operator : Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Shagun Singh : Great. Thank you so much and congratulations to both Glenn and Preston here. I was just wondering if we should expect any shift in priorities given this transition. And then, Kevin, a question for you on the LRP. Your algorithm -- growth algorithm has been 5% weighted average market growth, but another 200 to 300 basis points of outperformance gets you to 7% to 8%. You have exceeded those levels in recent years, including 2024. How -- and you've made some deals here as well. So how should we think about that weighted average market growth going forward? And then just similarly on margins, you guys had previously said at least 30 basis points annually beyond 2025. How do you think about peak levels? Thank you for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks, Shagun. We're going to have an Analyst Day later this year. And so we'll update at that time kind of the growth algorithm for the future years beyond 2025. Clearly, we're moving into faster-growing markets. So that weighted average market growth rate is moving up as we increase our exposure to faster-growing end markets. And as it relates to operating margin expansion, you saw we had a terrific year in 2024. We're planning on another strong year. We believe we have this operating margin power in the company, which is why we're absorbing Spine, which is why even for the Inari acquisition, we're not planning to give up much in the way of dilution at the operating margin level. But in terms of committing beyond that, I think we'll do that later on in the year at the Analyst Day. Oh, sorry, as it relates to the second part of your question -- sorry, there were many parts to your questions. The -- as it relates to priorities, I would say with me sitting in the chair here as CEO with Preston having been in the company both in the IR capacity and as the Head of Finance for Orthopaedics and Spine, you shouldn't expect any change in terms of our priorities. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matthew Miksic : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to everyone who's moving in and out of these positions. Preston, looking forward to working with you again, as everyone said. I know the conversation has been around Spine. There are a ton of questions. I don't think anybody saw this coming, but it does make a lot of sense for what it's worth. I just had one question maybe around some of the other businesses that have been doing so well with these -- with many product launches that we spent a good part of the last year talking about. So camera, defibrillator, even things like, I don't know, powered instruments and waste management. Just the basic question is, these are all punching kind of above double digits, how many -- maybe if you could dig through any of them that are going to start to kind of hit the other side of these refresh and product cycles by the end of the year. Or do all these carry into 2026? Any kind of color you could give on sustainability would be great. Then I have one quick follow-up. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Matt. As you rightly say, we have a whole lot of businesses that are really firing on all cylinders. Thanks for mentioning the camera because I think a year ago at this time, there was a lot of speculation that we would be impacted by the DR5, and that's clearly not the case, looking at our tremendous performance in cameras. There's plenty of room for both companies to grow. The way we do our launches is just before you start to see the business start to peter out, the new product comes on the scene. And so we have that all locked and loaded. The pipelines are still -- we're still investing healthy rates in R&D. So you shouldn't expect really any material slowdown in any of those businesses in 2025, and we will restock the funnel and be able to launch products before you start to see that. In the old days of Stryker, if you go back 10 years, you sort of have a bit of a gap sometimes. And in that gap year, you would have lower growth. But as you've noticed, in the last five, six, seven years, before the product starts to flag in terms of its growth, another system eight goes to system nine, will go to system 10. And we have the R&D products teed up to be able to insulate against that. So I'm feeling very good about 2025. And then again, we'll have an Analyst Day later in the year, and we'll talk about the outlook in the future. Matthew Miksic : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the shoulder. I know focus on the robot as being an important catalyst here. And one of your competitors is out there with the robot. Could you give us a sense that it's not just the implants and the robot, right? I mean there's a fair amount of other enabling technology. If you could give us a sense of maybe how that's contributing to growth, what the uptake or adoption has been like there and what other enabling technology solutions besides the robot you see as contributing to growth for shoulder in the next, say, I don't know, 12, 18 months. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Well, first of all, we have an incredible ecosystem with our Blueprint software and market-leading implants. Like absolutely terrific implants, stemless, short stem, anatomic, reverse, Perform Humeral system, which is totally modern and outstanding. And Blueprint provides AI guidance to the surgeon and actually presents surgical plan, which type of implant should be implemented. And that Blueprint software has been integrated with the robot. So the same software that the surgeon is used to using to plan their procedure will be the same software they're using on Mako. And so it's -- that has been the formula for the Tornier system under Wright Medical and now under Stryker to have market leading growth for years. And we continue that progress forward. And Mako is just added benefit, but it hasn't been like we've needed the robot. And initially, our robot is going to come out and start off with the reverse, which is about 2/3 of the procedure so that, by far, the most procedures are reversed. And then eventually, we move to other parts of the procedure. But as we saw with hips and knees, not all robots are equal. And we love our Mako Shoulder application, and you'll start to hear a surgeon feedback about it. We'll be showing it at Academy. If you're at AAOS, you'll get a chance to see it. It's really compelling. We think it's going to be very powerful. But again, it's not as if the shoulder business really even needs this because of the high growth that they already have with market-leading implants and Blueprint software, which is the best-in-class software system to navigate and plan your shoulder. And not to mention that we have Shoulder iD, which is a custom patient match glenoid. Glenoid, as we know, is the trickiest part of the anatomy. And we are actually just starting to expand that personalized solution, which surgeons find absolutely fantastic. Saves some time. Doesn't -- you don't have to put an augment in the shoulder. So that -- there's a series of other product launches that we have that are pretty exciting. And longer term, I can imagine mixed reality will play into this. But that's sort of looking out 2026, 2027 and beyond. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Matson with Needham & Company, Inc. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Matson : Yes. Thanks. So with the Spine divestiture, just wanted to ask about how the Mako and Enabling Technologies partnership will sort of work. I know one of your competitors tried to be something similar when they spun out their Spine business, and it didn't really seem to work in the end. Is there still the same type of revenue opportunity here from the Mako Spine robot? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, the Mako Spine robot is going to be compelling because it's Mako. And the brand is extremely strong, and the initial cases we've done have gone very well. The surgeons who are using our existing spine implants will now be obviously served by similar salespeople. That will be part of the VB Spine business. So there won't be a lot of change in that respect. It will just be the same rep in the operating room using Mako and the same implant that they've been using today. And then the VB Spine team will obviously go out and try to attract other surgeons to join the business. So we already operated in two different worlds. We had capital salespeople providing Mako and our MAKOplasty specialists, and then we had the implant business. So it's -- instead of that being Stryker Spine, it's now VB Spine. So it's not really for the customer a big difference. We have a little bit more work to do because it's a third party. So when we're doing contracts, we have to contract together with a third party. But I'm not expecting it to be really a big difference versus what we have. What does change is we're not going to be investing in all the innovation on implants and having to deal with the management of the implant business, which, to be frank, we have not done a great job over the past 10, 12 years. It's a tough competitive market, which the VB Brothers know very well. They've been in this business a long time. They know this business. And I think they're going to be laser-focused on it, whereas for us, we have a lot of other areas of investment that we put a bit more focus on. So -- but to the customer in the short term at least, it's not going to be much of an impact. And we do -- what we thought we could do with Mako Spine in terms of the revenue isn't much different with this partner. They're going to be exclusive at least for the first few years, and then we'll see weapons beyond that, whether it stays exclusive or whether it becomes a more open system. But I'm hoping that it stays exclusive and that we -- that they do really, really well and we do well alongside that. Michael Matson : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just in terms of -- I know you mentioned that you've got a plant in Mexico. There's talk of potential tariffs on Mexico and Canada. So how much of your manufacturing is coming from either of those two countries? And how much flexibility do you have to move production elsewhere if we do end up seeing some tariffs there this weekend? Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Yes, it's a good question. I think, first of all, just you got to keep in mind the scale here. We have roughly 40 manufacturing plants around the world, and we have one in Mexico. It does assembly of some of our products. So right now, we are looking at this closely. We're following the discussions. It's a little early to really evaluate what the possibility of that might be and the impact to us or even maybe the potential follow-on impact to customers. So right now, I would say we're like most companies, especially medical companies that may be excluded at some level from a certain level of tariffs. We're watching and sort of seeing which way this develops. But keep in mind, it's one plant out of 40. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Caitlin Cronin : Hey, congrats on a great quarter and congrats to Glenn and Preston as well. I guess just to start off, with these new Mako launches in spine and shoulder, have you seen any momentum, increased interest from hospitals and ASC about the excitement of just having one-stop shop for the Mako solution, as you kind of touched on before? Kevin Lobo : Yes. It's a bit early still, right? We're just kind of in limited launch on both of these, and we're gaining experience. And we're not out actively -- certainly on shoulder, not actively promoting it in ASCs yet. We're going to stay in a limited number of sites to make sure we get all our training protocols done. But there is excitement. The Mako brand is a strong brand, certainly because of our success with knees and hips. And so I do expect that we're going to be asked about it, but it's early days still. I would say stay tuned. We'll update you in future quarters as the launches proceed. Spine will move a little bit more quickly than shoulder. There's less change management involved for the surgeon. So that will move to a quicker launch. So we'll probably be able to tell you more about spine probably at the end of Q3. Caitlin Cronin : Got it. Thanks. And then just strong extremities number. You didn't really mention Foot & Ankle in the commentary. How did that business fare in Q4? And any commentary on the market environment going into 2025? Kevin Lobo : Yes. You recall the first couple of quarters of the year, the Foot & Ankle market was very soft. It did start picking up kind of around September, and fourth quarter certainly was better for the market overall, and our business did improve. But the real story around an unbelievable fourth quarter for Trauma and Extremities, it was really powered by our shoulder business and our core trauma. Core trauma business had an exceptional quarter. It was partly Pangea, but not just Pangea, just amazing sales force execution in that business. And Pangea has created a halo impact around the entire business. And I expect Trauma and Extremities to have a terrific year again in 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Richard Newitter : Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats, Preston. And good luck, Glenn. Just going back to the CapEx environment question I think someone asked earlier. I'm just curious. You guys obviously have great insight into conversations at the hospital C-suite level. Just with all the rhetoric going on out there about potential health care policy changes coming, some of the uncertainty that must be brewing with some of your customers, I'm just curious. Are you starting to see -- maybe not for the 2025 fiscal years and budget, but are there any behavior changes that are going on? Or how are your customers, if at all, expressing any potential emerging anxiety? Jason Beach : Rich, it's Jason. I won't try to speculate on any policy potentially coming in the future. But what I would say is similar to what I said earlier on the call, which is, as we look at kind of the capital environment as we ended 2024, and frankly, early days here in 2025, very positive for us. And we feel good about the environment, certainly, and don't have any reason to believe as we go throughout this year it'd be any different at this point. Richard Newitter : Okay. That's very encouraging to hear. And maybe just one more Inari and the process. We all had access to the proxy, and I think I read it right, but it looked like the -- it looked like you guys got access to the financials and whatnot in early December. It feels like a pretty quick turnaround to diligence. I guess, one, is that -- was I reading that right? And can you give any color on how much work had been done prior to that or how you got comfortable with the diligence on this end market and the company so fast? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, it's a publicly traded company. That is a very typical due diligence period you have for publicly traded companies. There's a lot of information that was publicly available, and we had done our homework, frankly, prior to the start of this. As you know, I've mentioned peripheral vascular many, many times. So we were absolutely prepared and done all of our homework on everything public. And then when we got a chance to go in and look at things and go into our due diligence, we knew exactly where to look, what to look for and -- including the R&D line and felt very good about what we saw with the team that we sent there. So this is not atypical for a public company deal, and we feel like we had a really sufficient amount of due diligence to feel comfortable moving forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Josh Jennings : Hi, good evening. Thanks so much and congrats to Glenn and Preston. Kevin, I was hoping to just touch on the continued kind of build-out of the ASC infrastructure in the U.S. It's been a tailwind. Stryker is best positioned. I think most think about procedure volume increases as being the biggest boost, but many of your businesses are levered to this continuing year-over-year of increase in the number of ASCs in the U.S. So I guess the question is really, one, what inning are we in, in this ASC infrastructure build-out in the U.S.? And two, can you just help us think about which businesses? Because I think there are a lot, maybe it's too long to answer, but that are benefiting from this tailwind. And how long do you expect this to last? Kevin Lobo : Yes. Listen, I still think we're in early innings, and it's very exciting for us at Stryker. So I love this trend because we have many businesses that play in the ASC. And most of the deals that we do, especially new construction and builds and big renovations, involve at least six of our business units and sometimes more and -- which is really exciting. So obviously, the ones that you think about automatically are hips and knees, but it also involves our Orthopaedic Instruments. It can involve Foot & Ankle. It always involves Sports Medicine, communications, booms and lights. Sometimes you have stretchers. So there's a suite of businesses, and everyone is customized. So every ASC deal is unique because of -- the number of RRs varies and the types of procedures that they choose to do also varies. But normally, you always have sports. You have hips and you have knees. And then you have potentially other procedures around that, interventional spine and on and on. So we love the way things are moving, even ENT. But what I'd say is if you think about just hips and knees as kind of like the sort of the biggest change that's occurred in the last four or five years, in this fourth quarter, we hit a high for both hips and knees in the U.S. ASC market. Knees, there were -- 17% of our knees were done in the ASC and 14% of our hips. And that's just been, I'll call it, a steady climb quarter after quarter. It's not -- it's sort of inflecting, but it's just a steady increase. And I think the only gating factor is construction of new ASCs, which will take time. So this is not something that I see kind of changing the ramp of -- the curve is just going to continue kind of on its current linear trajectory. I don't think it's going to inflect because capacity just isn't easy to bring on stream in large, large, large quantities. So I think it will just be a continuation. And I don't see an end in sight because -- and patients have a great experience. The surgeons love it. And healthy people should be going to these places to get procedures and don't have a risk of getting and contracting illnesses when they're there. And sick people will go to hospitals and healthy people are going to go to ASCs. So I don't see this slowing down, but it will be a gradual progression over time. Josh Jennings : I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the answer to the acquisition strategy post Inari, getting that weighted average market growth rate higher. There are many high-growth cardiovascular segments, and you're now in peripheral vascular. Should we consider this kind of initial thrust into in the peripheral vascular kind of opening the door to other high-growth cardiovascular sectors as well for Stryker? Thanks again for taking the questions. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Thanks for the question. At least initially, let's integrate this, and we'll look to probably add within the peripheral space. Beyond that, we'll see longer term. But I don't expect that we'll, in the near term, kind of make a jump into cardiovascular. I think we have to get to our homework here, get this integrated, and frankly, build around these call points that we're in right now. There's a lot more room within even peripheral vascular for them to play. And those emerging technologies are really exciting. We want to light those on fire and be able to realize those businesses. And we also have a lot of other mouths to feed across Stryker, a lot of business that are sort of spinning up deals. And so I think we're going to pay attention to those at least for the rest of this year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. And Glenn, congrats to you. Enjoy retirement. Preston, really looking forward working with you again. Just a question on R&D and productivity there. I mean you saw a pretty healthy growth in R&D in 2024. I mean this plays into the super cycle of new products you have, and it also helps on the pricing front. I mean how do we think about R&D spend going forward? I appreciate you guys for 2025 has given some goalpost there. But just at a high level and what you're seeing from an R&D productivity perspective and really how the focus might be changing there, if at all, to ensure you continue to get at least some modest price benefit and sustain this level of growth based on what is a very steady cadence of new product launches. Thanks so much. Glenn Boehnlein : Yes. Thanks, Danielle. And honestly, thanks for your question on R&D. It gives us a chance to talk about the amazing job that our teams are doing in R&D and lining up pipelines of products and new product launches and feature enhancements. And so honestly, that innovation engine is a giant engine of Stryker, and we generally target anywhere between 6% to 7% of sales as sort of a rough number to make sure that we're investing in R&D. It receives a very high priority in terms of as we go through our budgeting or our strategic planning process. We don't plan on backing down from that in any which way. We're very excited to take on the innovation of Inari and have those teams fold into our current innovation engine and feel like there'll be great synergies with our Neurovascular business on there. So honestly, I don't see that strategy really changing just in terms of the kind of spend we prioritize there. I think we're looking at -- where we look to drive better efficiencies might be where we're doing the R&D or building up centers of excellence around software programming or AI or digital any of those things. But honestly, I think in the 6% to 7% range, I think that's probably where you'll continue to see us stay. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Polark : Hey, good afternoon. I just have one final follow-up on the guidance, the organic revenue growth guidance as it relates to the Spine. So I just want to be very clear. The full year for the full company has guided 8% to 9%. You're saying that includes Spine, which if I'm doing math, assuming the 1H close, it's kind of 150 to 250 basis points of impact. So am I to look at the 8.5%, say, plus two is 10.5% as real kind of RemainCo organic revenue growth guidance for 2025? Thank you. Kevin Lobo : Yes. Michael, I think this is something maybe you can follow up with Jason offline. The Spine -- our 8% to 9% organic, we'll get some benefit when Spine is divested because Spine is growing at a lower rate. But it's pretty small, the impact on the overall Stryker business. And Jason can follow up with you off-line on that. But we're going to -- that will give us a slight benefit, probably not that similar to the headwind we're going to get by having one less day next year than we do this year. So those two kind of more or less offset. So the 8% to 9% is a pretty good guide, a pretty healthy guide. And Spine doesn't give us this massive benefit just given its size. But again, Jason can follow up with you off-line on that. Operator : There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks. Kevin Lobo : Thank you all for joining our call. I want to thank Glenn once again for great nine years and also for building a great pipeline of talent in finance. We're -- obviously Preston but the entire finance organization. We have terrific people all over the company just as we do in our commercial organization. We've, over time, built extremely strong functions at Stryker that support our businesses and line up behind our business to help them succeed. And we look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you in early May. Thank you.",
